Now, with the latest omicron variant, XBB, fueling a resurgence in cases, the response from China’s government and the public is muted at best.The surge comes about six months after the country dismantled its sprawling infrastructure for dealing with Covid, including harsh lockdowns, mass testing, stifling quarantines and strict mask requirements.“People feel differently about this wave,” said Qi Zhang, 30, who works at a finance company in the northern city of Tianjin. “The last time, everyone was terrified, but now they don’t think it’s a big deal,” she told NBC News on Thursday.Commuters wearing face masks in Beijing on May 26, 2023. Mark Schiefelbein / APThe new wave’s data was revealed by respiratory disease specialist Zhong Nanshan at a medical conference this week in the southern city of Guangzhou. According to state media, he told the audience that the wave that started in late April was “anticipated,” and that his modeling suggested China could be approaching 40 million infections per week. By the end of June, he said, the weekly number of infections will peak at 65 million.The United States, by comparison, was reporting more than 5 million cases a week at its peak last January. Like the U.S., China stopped providing weekly case updates this month, making it difficult to know the true extent of the current outbreak.China’s new ambassador warns of ‘serious difficulties’ in relationship with U.S.May 23, 202302:11The State Department said the U.S., which imposed a testing requirement on travelers from China in January before lifting it in March, was discussing China’s second Covid wave with allies and partners but declined to say whether travel restrictions were under consideration. Spokesperson Matt Miller said the department would monitor the situation in conjunction with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention before updating travel guidelines.“We don’t want to see people anywhere, obviously, suffering from Covid-19,” Miller said Wednesday. The U.S. government remains committed to working with China “on transnational challenges, including on global health matters and maintaining open lines of communication,” he added.Various versions of the omicron subvariants, including XBB 1.5, XBB.1.16, also known as “Arcturus,” and XBB.1.9.1, have been circulating in the U.S. since December and make up nearly all of the current infections in the country. Although the CDC isn’t regularly tracking new cases and the majority of new infections are likely going uncounted, hospitalizations and deaths are continuing to decline in the U.S. Experts suggest the U.S. already has a strong level of immunity against the highly transmissible form of the virus.During China’s first omicron wave in December and January, a different omicron variant was infecting millions of people every day, overwhelming hospitals and crematoriums in cities across the country. Store shelves were emptied of fever medications and schools were shut down. About 80% of China’s 1.4 billion people were infected during that wave, Wu Zunyou, chief epidemiologist at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said in January. But immunity may have waned in the months since, raising the risk of reinfection.Zhong said at the medical conference that the government had given preliminary approval to two vaccines aimed at the XBB subvariants and that others could be approved soon.Commuters wearing masks during the morning rush hour in Beijing on Tuesday.Mark Schiefelbein / APThough China’s current wave will not equal the “tsunami” of cases it experienced in December and January, older people and those with underlying diseases are still relatively under-vaccinated and are at high risk for developing severe disease, said Jin Dong-yan, a virologist at the University of Hong Kong.“But the number is smaller and so the good thing is that the hospitals then can take care of them in a better way,” he said.Joey Wang, 24, a student in Hebei province, said many people were finding Covid symptoms less severe this time around. But public fears also seem to have been eased by the change in government messaging.“No more media coming out trying to terrify the public, no more ‘fight the pandemic’ type of short videos to alert people, and no more hardcore measures like the lockdown,” he said.The Chinese government’s subdued response comes as it is trying to revive the economy and reassure U.S. and other foreign businesses, which would react negatively to the return of restrictions.“Covid-zero enforcement was very interruptive to business,” said Michael Hart, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, “and so we said again and again to the Chinese government, what companies need is stability, clarity, so they can plan.”Zhang, the finance employee, said colleagues who recently tested positive were choosing to come to work anyway, contrasting it with the first wave when everyone spent long periods working from home.“When I look back to such strict Covid measures, it feels like a dream,” she said. “It makes me doubt if all those strict lockdowns were right if we ended up here anyway.”Janis Mackey Frayer reported from Beijing, and Jennifer Jett reported from Hong Kong.Janis Mackey FrayerJanis Mackey Frayer is a Beijing-based correspondent for NBC News.Jennifer JettJennifer Jett is Asia digital editor for NBC News, based in Hong Kong.Dawn Liu, Jace Zhang and Abigail Williams  contributed ","{'neg': 0.06, 'neu': 0.871, 'pos': 0.069, 'compound': 0.7895}",0.7895,"China faces a new Covid wave that could peak at 65 million cases a week

The presence of the suspicious computer code was announced Wednesday by Microsoft in a warning it issued to private sector users of its software. The U.S. territory of Guam is the location of a critical Marine base that would respond to China if it attacked Taiwan. The National Security Agency also issued an alert to electrical utilities, nuclear power stations, water systems, railways and other key sectors that could be vulnerable.“The U.S. intelligence community assesses that China almost certainly is capable of launching cyberattacks that can disrupt critical infrastructure services within the United States,” State Department spokesman Matt Miller told reporters Thursday. “It’s vital for government network defenders in the public to stay vigilant.”U.S. nuclear secrets are vulnerable to spies, report saysMay 25, 202302:51The news comes as U.S. and Chinese officials are holding their first Cabinet-level meetings in Washington during the Biden administration, with Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo meeting with her counterpart, Chinese Commerce Minister Wang Wentao. U.S. officials said that the two had “candid and substantive discussions” Thursday and that Raimondo ""raised concerns"" about recent government actions against U.S. companies operating in China.U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai was also scheduled to meet with Wang. They will both also attend a meeting of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, commonly known as APEC, in Detroit on Friday and Saturday along with ministers from other countries in those regions.Asked whether the new malware could affect the economic talks, Miller said, “We do intend to use our conversations with the Chinese government to press on areas where we have concerns.” Before leaving a summit of leading industrial nations in Japan on Sunday, President Joe Biden expressed optimism that the U.S. and China would soon be able to improve bilateral relations. Tensions heightened after the U.S. shot down a Chinese spy balloon in early February off the South Carolina coast after it crossed the country from Montana to the Atlantic coast. China has maintained it was a weather balloon that had blown off course, repeating that claim most recently in meetings national security adviser Jake Sullivan held with Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang two weeks ago in Vienna. China had earlier halted regular military communications with the Pentagon to protest then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s trip to Taiwan last September. A senior U.S. official told NBC News that the two meetings with the Chinese officials in Washington could bolster Biden’s push for a diplomatic thaw between the two countries. The official suggested that a trip to China by Secretary of State Antony Blinken that was canceled after the balloon was shot down could be rescheduled by August, as well as visits by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, Raimondo and climate envoy John Kerry. But China’s Foreign Ministry reacted harshly to the hacking accusation Thursday, accusing the U.S. of working with its allies to launch a coordinated disinformation campaign.“We noted this extremely unprofessional report, a patchwork with a broken chain of evidence,” ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said. “We also noted that the U.S. National Security Agency and the cybersecurity agencies of the U.K., Australia, Canada and New Zealand, almost simultaneously issued similar reports.”Another negative signal came when China’s newly appointed ambassador to the U.S., Xie Feng, said on arrival Tuesday that “the relationship is faced with serious difficulties and challenges.” On Thursday, Feng met with Victoria Nuland, undersecretary of state for political affairs, at the State Department. Nuland tweeted a photograph of herself shaking hands with the new Chinese envoy and tried to strike an optimistic note about easing tensions, writing, “Open dialogue is critical to managing our relationship.”Andrea MitchellAndrea Mitchell is chief Washington correspondent and chief foreign affairs correspondent for NBC News.Abigail WilliamsAbigail Williams is a producer and reporter for NBC News covering the State Department.Zoë RichardsZoë Richards is the evening politics reporter for NBC News ","{'neg': 0.064, 'neu': 0.887, 'pos': 0.049, 'compound': -0.9146}",-0.9146,"Will Chinese hacking derail U.S. hopes for a thaw with Beijing

At around 230 feet tall and 50 feet wide, its physical stature was surpassed only by its status as a national symbol.Crowds gathered in the center of the capital to see the wrecked trunk for themselves. ""It was regarded as a symbol of liberty and freedom by early settlers"" in the West African country — which was founded by freed American slaves — according to President Julius Maada Bio, who joined the crowds at the site Thursday.“The Cotton Tree wasn’t just a tree,” Bio tweeted, “it was a connection between the past, present and the future.”The centuries-old Cotton Tree in Freetown in 2011.Tommy Trenchard / Alamy Stock PhotoThe great shade of the Cotton Tree had offered returning Black freed slaves a resting place and prayer ground when they arrived by boat in the 1700s, the country's Ministry of Tourism and Cultural Affairs said on its website. While it stood strong in the face of landslides driven by climate change and a lightning strike, a heavy downpour Wednesday night left nothing of the Cotton Tree but a stump.It was “damaged beyond repair,” said Zebek, a press agency working with Sierra Leone’s government, “its entire trunk sheared off a few metres above the ground.”The weight of the loss “is comparable with the 2019 fire that destroyed the Notre Dame cathedral in Paris,” Zebek said. A bulldozer clears the fallen Cotton Tree in downtown Freetown on Thursday.TJ Bade / APFreetown’s city structure sprung from the Cotton Tree’s central position, and the tree became a national icon that appeared on bank notes, featured in lullabies and was a stop for royalty.Queen Elizabeth II visited it in 1961 on a visit marking Sierra Leone’s independence from Britain.As Freetown transformed into an urban city over time, the Cotton Tree “remained a singular oasis of green,” Zebek said. It was a shelter not only for the people, but for vultures that served as literary inspirations for novelists like Graham Greene, who likened them to “broken umbrellas.”This historical painting, shown in 2016, is exhibited in the National Museum of Sierra Leone.Georg Berg / Alamy Stock PhotoBio said that parts of the tree would be preserved in the National Museum.The Ministry of Tourism and Cultural Affairs immediately took action to preserve the remaining trunk and urged the public against cutting away parts from the remains.The government welcomed “public debate on the future use of the site,” Zebek said, and sounded an optimistic note.“When a tree falls naturally due to extreme weather, a new life springs forward,” Bio said. “Together, we will preserve the legacy of unity, freedom and liberty of our iconic Cotton Tree.”Lyme ChoLyme Cho is an intern for NBC News based in London.Reuters and Associated Press contributed ","{'neg': 0.042, 'neu': 0.856, 'pos': 0.102, 'compound': 0.9934}",0.9934,"A tree felled in a storm leaves a nation mourning a 'great loss'

Ethiopia has been asking for the prince's remains and other treasures to be returned for the last 150 years.Fasil Minas, a descendent of the Abyssinian royal family and a relative of Alemayehu, told the BBC: “We want his remains back as a family and as Ethiopians because that is not the country he was born in.”But the palace said this week that this wasn't possible as it would disturb other human remains buried nearby.""The Dean and Canons of Windsor are very sensitive to the need to honour the memory of Prince Alemayehu,"" Buckingham Palace said in a statement sent to NBC News on Tuesday.""However, they have been advised that it is very unlikely that it would be possible to exhume the remains without disturbing the resting place of a substantial number of others in the vicinity,"" the statement said.The Ethiopian Embassy in London is welcome to keep visiting the grave to pay respects, the statement added — but historians said the palace should do more to take responsibility for its past.Staff from the Ethiopian Embassy in London pay tribute to the late prince outside St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle in 2019.@EthioEmbassyUK / Twitter""This is such an emotional issue because it reminds everyone of Alemayehu’s plight — a child stuck in a foreign land, never allowed to go home,"" Andrew Heavens, author of a new book on Alemayehu and the British raid on Abyssinia titled ""The Prince and the Plunder,"" told NBC News. ""Emotionally, most people who get to know Alemayehu’s story feel his remains should be returned. He made it so clear before he died that he wanted to go back,"" Heavens said.The palace could do more to show Ethiopia exactly why the prince's body can't be removed, Heavens added. Alemayehu was the son of the emperor of Abyssinia, Tewodros II, a Coptic Christian ruler who had taken missionaries and British government officials captive after Britain refused to assist him in wars with mostly Muslim neighboring countries.In December 1867, Britain launched an expedition of 13,000 soldiers and 40,000 animals, including 44 elephants trained to pull huge artillery guns, according to the National Army Museum in London, to free the hostages.Alemayehu was an orphan and Captain Speedy, left, became his guardian.V&A Images / Getty ImagesIt took until April for them to reach the Abyssinian capital, Maqdala. More than 500 Abyssinians were killed and thousands injured in a 90-minute battle — some estimates are much higher and no complete contemporary record exists.British forces sustained two deaths, with 18 soldiers injured. Tewodros subsequently killed himself with a pistol that had been a gift from Queen Victoria.It took 15 elephants and around 200 mules to carry all the wealth the British looted from Maqdala. Alemayehu's mother, Empress Tiruwork Wube, intended to travel to England with her son but died on the journey.Queen Victoria took an interest in Alemayehu and arranged for him to study at elite schools, before he was sent to the military training academy at Sandhurst. He left after less than a year for the English city of Leeds, where he died of pleurisy — inflammation of the lining surrounding the lungs — at age 18 in 1879.Victoria wrote in her diary: ""Very grieved and shocked to hear by telegram, that good Alemayehu had passed away this morning. It is too sad! All alone, in a strange country, without a single person or relative, belonging to him."" He was buried in the catacombs of St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle.Tracing the origins of the notorious Kohinoor diamondMay 10, 202303:56For Jeremiah Garsha, an expert in the looting of human remains at University College Dublin, originally from California, there is no doubt that Alemayehu was stolen.""He was, he was kidnapped,"" he said. ""You have a minor coming to another country as an orphan after his mother dies and then he himself dies at 18 — something should feel wrong about that. He's looted as well, like all the other curios and treasures that were taken.""The British obsession with Africa at the time created a huge market for stolen goods. This curiosity extended from ceremonial shields and religious items to living Black African people.""You wouldn't kidnap a white child; Victoria's not going to end up with a child from [London suburb] Camden Town — there has to be a racial element, the foreignness for this prince to come and be at the palace,"" Garsha said.Many of the treasures that were taken remain in the British Museum, which has been discussing the possible return of certain items with Ethiopian officials since 2019.Several other countries, including Benin and Greece, have long petitioned the British government for the return of items that they consider stolen during the colonial era.Patrick SmithPatrick Smith is a London-based editor and reporter for NBC News Digital.Victoria Di Gioacchino contributed ","{'neg': 0.096, 'neu': 0.836, 'pos': 0.068, 'compound': -0.9908}",-0.9908,"Buckingham Palace rejects calls to return remains of 'stolen' prince to Ethiopia

NHK said that the mother told police that the attacker was her son and that his father was chairman of the city assembly.Japanese media quoted neighbors described the suspect as a quiet person and that they were not aware of any family feud.Police said earlier that two police officers were shot by the suspect when they arrived at the scene after receiving an emergency call saying a woman was stabbed. The officers were apparently without bulletproof vests.The house where the suspect, armed with a rifle, was holed up in Nakano.APOn Friday, Nagano police chief said the suspect allegedly stabbed to death the 66-year-old woman with a survival knife.A witness told NHK on Thursday that a woman fell while being chased by the suspect, who then stabbed her with a knife and shot at two police officers as they arrived at the scene in a patrol car.The woman and the two police officers were pronounced dead at a hospital. An older woman, who was injured but could not be rescued because she was near the suspect, was found dead early Friday, police said.During the standoff, TV footage showed police wearing bulletproof vests and carrying shields, with an ambulance nearby. Police sealed off a 330-yard radius around the house, and city officials urged people in the quiet farming neighborhood to stay home or stay at an evacuation center, where about 80 people reportedly took shelter.Violent crimes are rare in Japan. It has strict gun control laws and only a handful of gun-related crimes annually. But in recent years, there have been some high-profile cases involving random knifings on subways and arson attacks, and there is growing concern about homemade guns and explosives.Associated Pres ","{'neg': 0.117, 'neu': 0.864, 'pos': 0.019, 'compound': -0.9952}",-0.9952,"Suspect in killing of 4 people, including 2 police officers, in Japan captured after standoff

Now, with the latest omicron variant, XBB, fueling a resurgence in cases, the response from China’s government and the public is muted at best.The surge comes about six months after the country dismantled its sprawling infrastructure for dealing with Covid, including harsh lockdowns, mass testing, stifling quarantines and strict mask requirements.“People feel differently about this wave,” said Qi Zhang, 30, who works at a finance company in the northern city of Tianjin. “The last time, everyone was terrified, but now they don’t think it’s a big deal,” she told NBC News on Thursday.Commuters wearing face masks in Beijing on May 26, 2023. Mark Schiefelbein / APThe new wave’s data was revealed by respiratory disease specialist Zhong Nanshan at a medical conference this week in the southern city of Guangzhou. According to state media, he told the audience that the wave that started in late April was “anticipated,” and that his modeling suggested China could be approaching 40 million infections per week. By the end of June, he said, the weekly number of infections will peak at 65 million.The United States, by comparison, was reporting more than 5 million cases a week at its peak last January. Like the U.S., China stopped providing weekly case updates this month, making it difficult to know the true extent of the current outbreak.China’s new ambassador warns of ‘serious difficulties’ in relationship with U.S.May 23, 202302:11The State Department said the U.S., which imposed a testing requirement on travelers from China in January before lifting it in March, was discussing China’s second Covid wave with allies and partners but declined to say whether travel restrictions were under consideration. Spokesperson Matt Miller said the department would monitor the situation in conjunction with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention before updating travel guidelines.“We don’t want to see people anywhere, obviously, suffering from Covid-19,” Miller said Wednesday. The U.S. government remains committed to working with China “on transnational challenges, including on global health matters and maintaining open lines of communication,” he added.Various versions of the omicron subvariants, including XBB 1.5, XBB.1.16, also known as “Arcturus,” and XBB.1.9.1, have been circulating in the U.S. since December and make up nearly all of the current infections in the country. Although the CDC isn’t regularly tracking new cases and the majority of new infections are likely going uncounted, hospitalizations and deaths are continuing to decline in the U.S. Experts suggest the U.S. already has a strong level of immunity against the highly transmissible form of the virus.During China’s first omicron wave in December and January, a different omicron variant was infecting millions of people every day, overwhelming hospitals and crematoriums in cities across the country. Store shelves were emptied of fever medications and schools were shut down. About 80% of China’s 1.4 billion people were infected during that wave, Wu Zunyou, chief epidemiologist at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said in January. But immunity may have waned in the months since, raising the risk of reinfection.Zhong said at the medical conference that the government had given preliminary approval to two vaccines aimed at the XBB subvariants and that others could be approved soon.Commuters wearing masks during the morning rush hour in Beijing on Tuesday.Mark Schiefelbein / APThough China’s current wave will not equal the “tsunami” of cases it experienced in December and January, older people and those with underlying diseases are still relatively under-vaccinated and are at high risk for developing severe disease, said Jin Dong-yan, a virologist at the University of Hong Kong.“But the number is smaller and so the good thing is that the hospitals then can take care of them in a better way,” he said.Joey Wang, 24, a student in Hebei province, said many people were finding Covid symptoms less severe this time around. But public fears also seem to have been eased by the change in government messaging.“No more media coming out trying to terrify the public, no more ‘fight the pandemic’ type of short videos to alert people, and no more hardcore measures like the lockdown,” he said.The Chinese government’s subdued response comes as it is trying to revive the economy and reassure U.S. and other foreign businesses, which would react negatively to the return of restrictions.“Covid-zero enforcement was very interruptive to business,” said Michael Hart, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, “and so we said again and again to the Chinese government, what companies need is stability, clarity, so they can plan.”Zhang, the finance employee, said colleagues who recently tested positive were choosing to come to work anyway, contrasting it with the first wave when everyone spent long periods working from home.“When I look back to such strict Covid measures, it feels like a dream,” she said. “It makes me doubt if all those strict lockdowns were right if we ended up here anyway.”Janis Mackey Frayer reported from Beijing, and Jennifer Jett reported from Hong Kong.Janis Mackey FrayerJanis Mackey Frayer is a Beijing-based correspondent for NBC News.Jennifer JettJennifer Jett is Asia digital editor for NBC News, based in Hong Kong.Dawn Liu, Jace Zhang and Abigail Williams  contributed ","{'neg': 0.06, 'neu': 0.871, 'pos': 0.069, 'compound': 0.7895}",0.7895,"China faces a new Covid wave that could peak at 65 million cases a week

The presence of the suspicious computer code was announced Wednesday by Microsoft in a warning it issued to private sector users of its software. The U.S. territory of Guam is the location of a critical Marine base that would respond to China if it attacked Taiwan. The National Security Agency also issued an alert to electrical utilities, nuclear power stations, water systems, railways and other key sectors that could be vulnerable.“The U.S. intelligence community assesses that China almost certainly is capable of launching cyberattacks that can disrupt critical infrastructure services within the United States,” State Department spokesman Matt Miller told reporters Thursday. “It’s vital for government network defenders in the public to stay vigilant.”U.S. nuclear secrets are vulnerable to spies, report saysMay 25, 202302:51The news comes as U.S. and Chinese officials are holding their first Cabinet-level meetings in Washington during the Biden administration, with Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo meeting with her counterpart, Chinese Commerce Minister Wang Wentao. U.S. officials said that the two had “candid and substantive discussions” Thursday and that Raimondo ""raised concerns"" about recent government actions against U.S. companies operating in China.U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai was also scheduled to meet with Wang. They will both also attend a meeting of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, commonly known as APEC, in Detroit on Friday and Saturday along with ministers from other countries in those regions.Asked whether the new malware could affect the economic talks, Miller said, “We do intend to use our conversations with the Chinese government to press on areas where we have concerns.” Before leaving a summit of leading industrial nations in Japan on Sunday, President Joe Biden expressed optimism that the U.S. and China would soon be able to improve bilateral relations. Tensions heightened after the U.S. shot down a Chinese spy balloon in early February off the South Carolina coast after it crossed the country from Montana to the Atlantic coast. China has maintained it was a weather balloon that had blown off course, repeating that claim most recently in meetings national security adviser Jake Sullivan held with Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang two weeks ago in Vienna. China had earlier halted regular military communications with the Pentagon to protest then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s trip to Taiwan last September. A senior U.S. official told NBC News that the two meetings with the Chinese officials in Washington could bolster Biden’s push for a diplomatic thaw between the two countries. The official suggested that a trip to China by Secretary of State Antony Blinken that was canceled after the balloon was shot down could be rescheduled by August, as well as visits by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, Raimondo and climate envoy John Kerry. But China’s Foreign Ministry reacted harshly to the hacking accusation Thursday, accusing the U.S. of working with its allies to launch a coordinated disinformation campaign.“We noted this extremely unprofessional report, a patchwork with a broken chain of evidence,” ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said. “We also noted that the U.S. National Security Agency and the cybersecurity agencies of the U.K., Australia, Canada and New Zealand, almost simultaneously issued similar reports.”Another negative signal came when China’s newly appointed ambassador to the U.S., Xie Feng, said on arrival Tuesday that “the relationship is faced with serious difficulties and challenges.” On Thursday, Feng met with Victoria Nuland, undersecretary of state for political affairs, at the State Department. Nuland tweeted a photograph of herself shaking hands with the new Chinese envoy and tried to strike an optimistic note about easing tensions, writing, “Open dialogue is critical to managing our relationship.”Andrea MitchellAndrea Mitchell is chief Washington correspondent and chief foreign affairs correspondent for NBC News.Abigail WilliamsAbigail Williams is a producer and reporter for NBC News covering the State Department.Zoë RichardsZoë Richards is the evening politics reporter for NBC News ","{'neg': 0.064, 'neu': 0.887, 'pos': 0.049, 'compound': -0.9146}",-0.9146,"Will Chinese hacking derail U.S. hopes for a thaw with Beijing

Naval History and Heritage CommandPrintMay 25, 2023, 1:46 PM UTCBy Lyme ChoWreckage from a U.S. Navy destroyer sunk by a kamikaze aircraft attack during World War II has been discovered by a team of underwater explorers in the Pacific Ocean.  The USS Mannert L. Abele was operating off the northern coast of the Japanese island of Okinawa on April 12, 1945, when it suddenly found itself ""surrounded by hostile planes,” the Naval History and Heritage Command said in a news release this week, as it announced the ship had been identified Thursday.  After the Sumner-class destroyer engaged with and damaged multiple enemy aircraft, a plane managed to crash next to it, penetrating its side, the command said, adding that a minute later it was “at the waterline by a Yokosuka MXY-7 Ohka.” Known as the “Cherry Blossom,” the Ohka was a rocket-powered human-guided bomb “and the resulting explosion caused the ship’s bow and stern to buckle rapidly,” the release said, adding that it became the first U.S. warship sunk by the weapon which was identified as “one of the first cruise missiles,” and fired up to 425 mph. Along with four fighter aircraft, inshore Fire Support ships fought further enemy attacks and began rescuing the Abele's survivors. However, 84 sailors were lost at sea.The ship’s discovery “allows some closure to the families of those lost, and provides us all another opportunity to remember and honor them,” said command Director Samuel J. Cox, a retired U.S. Navy rear admiral.Seen from a U.S. carrier, a Japanese suicide bomber crashes into the sea off the coast of Okinawa, Japan, in June 1945.  APThe ship was found in December by a group called the Lost 52 Project, which searches for Navy submarines and warships sunk during World War II.The Lost 52 Project said in a statement on its website that the ship was providing support for Operation Iceberg, the codename for the Battle of Okinawa. It added that the death of President Franklin D. Roosevelt on the same day “overshadowed,” the sinking. Five weeks later, America dropped atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Tim Taylor, the leader of the Lost 52 Project, said in the statement that the discovery was ""very emotive"" for him because his father had  come ""close to the same fate"" when his ship, the USS Telfair, was hit by a kamikaze attack.  The command said it had established the Abele as “U.S. sunken military craft protected by U.S. law and under the jurisdiction of the Department of the Navy,” and as a war grave of sailors respected by all. Discovery expeditions continue to seek U.S. Navy vessels lost during World War II.

Tina Turner dead at 83, known as Queen of Rock 'n' Roll02:03PrintMay 25, 2023, 1:24 PM UTCBy Sky NewsMany Australians feel a special connection to Tina Turner, with one of her early songs having found a unique place in the country’s culture.As fans around the world mourn the singer’s death at the age of 83, many in the country remember growing up learning the line dance to Nutbush City Limits, the song she performed with her then-husband and collaborator Ike in 1973.The song is about life in a small town in Tennessee and, despite it being a far cry from life in Australia, the dance has become a staple of weddings and parties.There are a number of reasons why this is very strange.Turner’s performances of the song never included the dance that has become so loved by Australians, and the song wasn’t even that popular anyway, peaking at number 14 when it was released in the 1970s and then at 16 when it was re-released in 1991.The Big Red Bash is an annual music festival held in the Simpson Desert in outback Queensland. Marc Grimwade / Getty Images fileThe dance is thought to have grown from a scheme combining the creative arts and physical education in primary schools in the states of New South Wales or Queensland.But others say it was never part of Australia’s education curriculum, and was instead spread by individual teachers, copying what they had seen in other schools.Interdisciplinary artist Kay Armstrong first encountered the Nutbush as a primary school student newly-arrived in Western Australia from England in the late 1970s.She told the Sydney Morning Herald in 2018: “We learnt the Nutbush in primary school, and then in high school, and then I’ve probably done it at every wedding I’ve gone to since.”The country’s keenest Nutbush fans have set world records for the largest number of people performing the dance.Some 4,084 people performed the dance at the Birdsville Big Red Bash in Queensland to break the previous record.A month later another 3,700 people gathered for the dance at the Mundi Mundi Bash in Broken Hill, New South Wales, but failed to set a new record.Sky NewsU.K.-based Sky News is owned by Comcast, the parent company of NBC News ","{'neg': 0.06, 'neu': 0.85, 'pos': 0.09, 'compound': 0.9147}",0.9147,"Doing the Nutbush: One country's strange love affair with Tina Turner

Canada, UK, Australia and New Zealand warned they could be targeted by the hackers too.Microsoft analysts said they had “moderate confidence” that this Chinese group, which it dubbed “Volt Typhoon,” was developing capabilities that could disrupt critical communications infrastructure between the United States and the Asia region during future crises.“It means they are preparing for that possibility,” said John Hultquist, who heads threat analysis at Google’s Mandiant Intelligence.The Chinese activity is unique and worrying also because analysts don’t yet have enough visibility on what this group might be capable of, he added.“There is greater interest in this actor because of the geopolitical situation.”As China has stepped up military and diplomatic pressure in its claim to democratically governed Taiwan, U.S. President Joe Biden has said he would be willing to use force to defend Taiwan.Security analysts expect Chinese hackers could target U.S. military networks and other critical infrastructure if China invades Taiwan.The NSA and other Western cyber agencies urged companies that operate critical infrastructure to identify malicious activity using the technical guidance they issued.“It is vital that operators of critical national infrastructure take action to prevent attackers hiding on their systems,” Paul Chichester, director at the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre, said in a joint statement with the NSA.Microsoft said the Chinese hacking group has been active since at least 2021 and has targeted several industries including communications, manufacturing, utility, transportation, construction, maritime, government, information technology and education.NSA cybersecurity director Rob Joyce said the Chinese campaign was using “built-in network tools to evade our defenses and leaving no trace behind.” Such techniques are harder to detect as they use “capabilities already built into critical infrastructure environments,” he added.As opposed to using traditional hacking techniques, which often involve tricking a victim into downloading malicious files, Microsoft said this group infects a victim’s existing systems to find information and extract data.Guam is home to U.S. military facilities that would be key to responding to any conflict in the Asia-Pacific region. It is also a major communications hub connecting Asia and Australia to the United States by multiple submarine cables.Bart Hoggeveen, a senior analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute who specializes in state-sponsored cyber attacks in the region, said the submarine cables made Guam “a logical target for the Chinese government” to seek intelligence.“There is high vulnerability when cables land on shore,” he said.New Zealand said it would work toward identifying any such malicious cyber activity in its country.“It’s important for the national security of our country that we’re transparent and upfront with Australians about the threats that we face,” Australia’s Minister for Home Affairs and Cyber Security Clare O’Neil said.Canada’s cybersecurity agency said it had no reports of Canadian victims of this hacking as yet. “However, Western economies are deeply interconnected,” it added. “Much of our infrastructure is closely integrated and an attack on one can impact the other.”Reuter ","{'neg': 0.091, 'neu': 0.838, 'pos': 0.071, 'compound': -0.9708}",-0.9708,"Chinese hackers are spying on U.S. critical infrastructure, Microsoft and Western intelligence agencies say

It is not clear how the watch came into Puyi’s possession.Patek Philippe watches have long been a collectors’ favorite, and in 2019 a one-of-a-kind Grandmaster Chime from the Swiss manufacturer became the world’s most expensive watch at auction, with a hammer price of $31.2 million.John Ng, a well-known independent watchmaker in Hong Kong who bid unsuccessfully for the emperor’s watch, said its sale could lead to a new trend.“Considering the current popularity of big, simple watches, small and complicated watches will receive more attention after this sale,” he said.Chinese Emperor Puyi in 1935.Universal Image Group / Getty ImagesPuyi was only 2 years old when he became emperor in 1908, leaving his family to move to the Forbidden City in Beijing. He was forced to abdicate in 1912 after the overthrow of the Qing Dynasty, though he continued living in the palace complex for years.In the 1930s, Puyi was appointed puppet leader of Manchuria, the northeastern region that Japan had occupied as part of its invasion of China. He tried to flee after Tokyo’s defeat in 1945 but was captured by Soviet troops and imprisoned in Siberia, where he had the watch with him. In 1950, the Soviet Union returned Puyi to China, where he was jailed for almost 10 years and then lived as a private citizen until his death in 1967 at age 61.Also included in the Hong Kong auction were a manuscript notebook belonging to Puyi, a leather-bound edition of Confucius’ “Analects,” and a red paper fan Puyi inscribed and gave to Permyakov in Tokyo. The fan sold for $77,846, six times the pre-sale estimate, while the other two items sold for a combined $121,634, almost five times the pre-sale estimate.

But since February, Xi has promoted a peace plan, which has been met with skepticism from the West and cautiously welcomed by Kyiv.Last week, China’s special representative for Eurasian affairs Li Hui visited Ukraine and met with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in a European tour that Beijing billed as its effort to promote peace talks and a political settlement of the crisis.Li Hui is scheduled to visit Russia on Friday.Reuter ","{'neg': 0.032, 'neu': 0.875, 'pos': 0.093, 'compound': 0.9886}",0.9886,"Russia and China seal economic pacts despite Western disapproval

China’s new ambassador warns of ‘serious difficulties’ in relationship with U.S.02:11PrintMay 23, 2023, 9:54 PM UTCBy Keir Simmons, Alexander Smith and Phil McCauslandThere are signs of deepening distrust between the United States and China even as the Biden administration and Beijing appeared to work to restart high-level talks. President Joe Biden this weekend predicted a “thaw very soon” between Washington and Beijing, the world’s largest economies. Tuesday’s arrival of Xie Feng, Beijing’s new ambassador in Washington, after more than four months, was a potential indication of warming ties, but the new envoy said the two countries’ relationship faced “serious difficulties and challenges.”“We hope that the United States will work together with China to increase dialogue, to manage differences and also to respect our cooperation so that our relationship will be back to the right track,” he told a small crowd made up mostly of journalists at New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport before climbing into a van with aides and members of his family. Xie Feng, China's new ambassador to the United States, upon his arrival at the John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York on Tuesday.Li Rui / APWhile Xie may have been cautiously upbeat, a senior Chinese diplomat recently shared a gloomier assessment of U.S.-China relations at a briefing. “The bilateral relationship has once again encountered a freeze,” the Chinese diplomat told NBC News, speaking on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak publicly on the matter. The conflicting signals serve to show what a roller coaster the countries’ relations have been on. Beijing reacted angrily to last weekend’s Group of Seven, or G7, summit in Hiroshima, Japan, which pledged to cooperate with China economically but be tougher in areas including “economic coercion,” human rights, Taiwan, Tibet, Hong Kong and Beijing’s growing assertiveness in the South China Sea. Beijing branded the communiqué “smears and lies.”Things were looking up six months ago after Biden’s meeting with President Xi Jinping in Indonesia, igniting hopes for a new chapter. But relations plummeted to a decades-low nadir and a planned trip to Beijing by Secretary of State Antony Blinken was canceled after a “spy balloon” was spotted allegedly gathering information by flying over sensitive U.S. military sites in February. China, which apologized for the incident soon after the vessel appeared over the West Coast but later took a more defensive stance, says it was an unmanned civilian weather balloon.Biden and Xi met on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Bali, Indonesia on Nov. 14, raising hopes that relations between the two countries would improve.Alex Brandon / AP fileAn hours-long meeting between national security adviser Jake Sullivan and China’s most senior diplomat, Wang Yi, on May 11 reignited predictions of new high-level talks. Days earlier and after a practical freeze in diplomatic high-level communications between the two countries, U.S. Ambassador to China Nicholas Burns met with Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang in Beijing. Then came this weekend’s G7 and China’s furious reaction to it.But before high-level diplomacy can move forward — with one of Biden’s Cabinet members visiting Beijing or a call between Biden and Xi — there are a number of obstacles China believes need to be addressed, according to the Chinese diplomat who spoke to NBC News, as well as public comments by Chinese state media and officials.The unnamed Chinese diplomat, who is based in Washington, highlighted three examples of “concerns yet to be addressed by the U.S. side.”Among these is the ongoing FBI investigation into the Chinese balloon shot down by the U.S., they said. Privately, Chinese officials express concern that publication of that investigation might force either side into an embarrassing cancellation of another meeting or call between Xi and Biden.China urges U.S. to ‘take practical actions’ on bilateral relationsMay 23, 202300:32The Biden administration has indicated it wants to move on.At the G7, Biden dismissed the so-called spy balloon as a “silly balloon.” Blinken, meanwhile, did not mention it in his opening remarks at a congressional hearing last week. The unnamed Chinese diplomat said another concern “yet to be addressed by the U.S. side” is the “false accusations,” as the diplomat put it, that China has been operating illegal police stations in New York and elsewhere around the world. The FBI has arrested two people accused of running one of these police stations in New York, just one of dozens of similar investigations in Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany and the Netherlands. China says the stations are there to help the diaspora with administrative issues.The diplomat appeared to rule out a Biden-Xi phone call in the near future. “It is hoped that the U.S. will work with China to address the issues in the relationship, and create favorable conditions for future interactions between the two top leaders,” the diplomat added.Favorable conditions will be hard to achieve, not least because politicians in the U.S. have largely coalesced around the subject of China.“China is an adversary to the United States in every way,” Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., said in reaction to the diplomat’s comments. “We cannot afford to be complacent or passive in the face of China’s continued aggression,” she added in a statement to NBC News.Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., a longtime China hawk, stressed the importance of a bipartisan approach toward Beijing earlier in May.“If we in America rest on our laurels, if we let the CCP beat us, it would have serious consequences for the world’s democratic nations,” he said, referring to the Chinese Communist Party. U.S. Navy sailors off the coast of South Carolina recover parts of the ""spy balloon"" on Feb. 5.Petty Officer 1st Class Tyler Thompson / U.S. NavyChina, meanwhile, appears to believe that it can forge closer ties with the United States’ European allies.A succession of Chinese diplomats have been touring the continent, including Foreign Minister Qin Gang and Wang Yi, the director of the Office of the Central Commission of Foreign Affairs. This week Li Hui, China’s Ukraine envoy, will continue a tour of Ukraine, Poland, Germany, France and Russia. At the G7, an idea promoted by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen gained traction. Rather than “decouple” from China, the West should “derisk” trade in industries where national interests are at stake. In other words, Europe should continue to have a dialogue and trade with China but also challenge Beijing when necessary and protect its vital industries. This comes even as Europe and the U.S. grow closer on the subject of China, according to Ian Bremmer, the president of political risk and research consulting firm Eurasia Group, author of “Superpower: Three Choices for America’s Role in the World” and a frequent commentator on world affairs. “China is consolidating economic power in ways that all of the G7 allies find problematic,” he said Tuesday.But Von der Leyen, and Europe in general, are not tough enough on China for many in Washington. “Our European allies need to make a decision,” Mace said. “They must choose whether to stand with China or to stand alongside the United States, and we cannot allow them to continue to play both sides.”And if Chinese state-controlled media is taken as a barometer of the elite’s view of the United States and the state of the relationship, nobody in Beijing is holding their breath.“Talk for the sake of talk will do little to remove the obstacles in the path of a sound relationship, which entails Washington’s concrete steps to demonstrate complete sincerity, and deliver on its promises,” according to an article in state news agency Xinhua earlier this month.  Keir SimmonsKeir Simmons is Chief International Correspondent for NBC News, based in London.Alexander SmithAlexander Smith is a senior reporter for NBC News Digital based in London.Phil McCauslandPhil McCausland is an NBC News reporter.Natasha Lebedeva, The Associated Press and Reuters contributed ","{'neg': 0.039, 'neu': 0.878, 'pos': 0.083, 'compound': 0.9958}",0.9958,"What China wants to improve relations with U.S. and why it may be a tall order

Kami Rita went on to the peak three days later for the 27th time.With a few more days left in the spring climbing season, both Sherpa guides were on the mountain helping their clients up the snowy peak. May is the busiest month to make the dangerous climb since it has the best weather conditions.Kami Rita first summitted Everest in 1994 and has been making the trip nearly every year since. He is one of many Sherpa guides whose expertise and skills are vital to the safety and success each year of foreign climbers who seek to stand on top of the mountain.His father was among the first Sherpa guides. In addition to his Everest climbs, Rita has scaled several other peaks that are among the world’s highest, including K2, Cho Oyu, Manaslu and Lhotse.Hundreds of climbers have scaled Mount Everest, or plan to make their attempt, this month.The Nepalese authorities have issued about 480 climbing permits to foreign climbers, which is the most issued for any year.

Topics included a push to have a president replace the British monarch as Australia’s head of state and Indigenous suffering from colonization.Critics complained that the ABC had soured the celebratory mood of the coronation.His supporters say inaccurate and inflammatory reporting of his views in the mainstream media has fueled racially abusive and threatening personal attacks on social media, wearing the news veteran down.After more than 30 years of news experience in Australian television, Grant wrote Friday in his regular ABC online column that Monday would be the last time in the foreseeable future that he would host “Q+A” because of the news media and social media abuse.“I take time out because we have shown again that our history — our hard truth — is too big, too fragile, too precious for the media. The media sees only battle lines, not bridges. It sees only politics,” Grant wrote. “The media has turned public discussion into an amusement park. Social media, at its worst, is a sordid spectacle. A grotesque burlesque. Lives are reduced to mockery and ridicule.”“I want no part of it. I want to find a place of grace far from the stench of the media,” Grant said.Grant was asked to participate on the panel “as a Wiradjuri man to discuss his own family’s experience and the role of the monarchy in Australia in the context of Indigenous history,” said Justin Stevens, ABC news director.“The responsibility for the coverage lies with ABC news management, not with Stan Grant,” Stevens said.Australian Broadcasting Corp. staff and other supporters gathered at the company offices in Sydney on Monday in support of Grant. Rick Rycroft / APHundreds of ABC colleagues, journalists and supporters carrying signs, including “We stand with Stan” and “We reject racism,” gathered outside the ABC’s Sydney headquarters Monday afternoon in a show of support for Grant.Grant’s journalist daughter Lowanna Grant told the crowd about the toll racist abuse had taken on their family.“It’s really hard to see him struggling, and that he’s had to cop (endure) the racism and disgusting filth that’s been online,” she said.Her mother and Stan Grant’s first wife, Karla Grant — also an Indigenous reporter — told the gathering that racial abuse was an ongoing issue for Indigenous journalists as well as the Grant family.“It’s an accumulation of years and years of racism our people have had to face,” Karla Grant said.Indigenous journalist Narelda Jacobs said she also experienced personal attacks for sharing Indigenous perspectives.“To see him now stepping down indefinitely from one of the most senior positions in Australia, it feels like a grieving. It feels like a sense of loss,” Jacobs said.“We’ve all experienced personal attacks. Every time I’m asked to talk about something that I feel passionately about, I have to take a moment and consider whether it’s really worth it,” Jacobs said.Indigenous Australians account for 3.2% of the national population and are Australia’s most disadvantaged ethnic minority.Associated Pres ","{'neg': 0.129, 'neu': 0.777, 'pos': 0.094, 'compound': -0.9912}",-0.9912,"Australian Indigenous TV host quits program over racist backlash

It was the site of fierce battles during World War II, and with a population of nearly 10 million people, it’s the most populous Pacific Island nation.The State Department said the new agreement provides a framework to help improve security cooperation, enhance the capacity of Papua New Guinea’s defense force and increase regional stability. The full agreement will be made public once politicians in both countries have an opportunity for input, likely in a couple of months.At a breakfast meeting, Papua New Guinea Prime Minister James Marape said his country faces significant security challenges, from skirmishes within the country to illegal fishing boats that light up the night like skyscrapers.“We have our internal security as well as our sovereignty security issues,” Marape said. “We’re stepping up on that front to make sure our borders are secure.”Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Papua New Guinea's Defence Minister Win Bakri Daki in Port Moresby on May 22, 2023. Adek Berry / AFP - Getty ImagesBut the agreement sparked student protests in the second-largest city, Lae. And many in the Pacific are concerned about the increasing militarization of the region.Student Naomi Kipoi, 17, said she was opposed to the security pact because she felt it means the U.S. could come to her country whenever it pleased without permission. She said China had been a big help to her country by building roads and funding schools.“The U.S. didn’t help us with aid and other things,” Kipoi said. “They’re just trying to sign the agreement.”Last year, nearby Solomon Islands signed its own security pact with China, a move that raised alarm throughout the Pacific. The U.S. has increased its focus on the Pacific, opening embassies in Solomon Islands and Tonga, reviving Peace Corps volunteer efforts, and encouraging more business investment.But some have questioned how reliable a partner the U.S. is in the Pacific, particularly after President Joe Biden canceled his plans to make an historic stop in Papua New Guinea to sign the pact. Biden would have been the first sitting U.S. president to visit any Pacific Island country, but he ended up canceling to focus on the debt limit talks back at home.U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken traveled in Biden’s place, arriving in Papua New Guinea early Monday. In response to news of Blinken’s impending visit, China warned against the introduction of “geopolitical games” into the region.As well as the defense pact, the U.S. also signed a maritime agreement with Papua New Guinea which will allow the U.S. Coast Guard to partner with the Pacific nation to counter illegal fishing and drug smuggling.The U.S. visit coincided with a trip by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was hosting a meeting with Pacific Island leaders to discuss ways to better cooperate.Blinken met with New Zealand Prime Minister Chris Hipkins and said the two nations had a shared vision for the region.“To make sure that it remains free, open, secure and prosperous,” Blinken said.Hipkins told Blinken he was very happy that Blinken had made the trip.“The increased U.S. presence in the Pacific is something we welcome,” Hipkins said.But Hipkins also drew a distinction to his own nation’s efforts.“We are not interested in the militarization of the Pacific,” Hipkins told reporters before the Blinken meeting. “We are interested in working with the Pacific on issues where we have mutual interest. Issues around climate change. And we’re not going to be attaching military strings to that support.”Hipkins was one of the few leaders to venture out publicly. He got a rapturous reception from hundreds of well-wishers when he visited Gordons Market, a large fruit and vegetable market.Associated Pres ","{'neg': 0.036, 'neu': 0.836, 'pos': 0.128, 'compound': 0.9956}",0.9956,"U.S. signs new security pact with Papua New Guinea amid competition with China

One China,” he said.His Weibo account said on Monday that he was banned from posting for “violating relevant laws and regulations.” Ng’s agency did not respond to a request for comment.A Chinese comedian, meanwhile, could face jail time as police and government departments investigate him for a joke he made at a performance earlier in May.Beijing police announced last Wednesday that they were investigating comedian Li Haoshi “for severely insulting” the People’s Liberation Army.The comedian, who goes by the stage name HOUSE, made a joke about stray dogs by riffing on a well-known propaganda slogan used to describe the Chinese military.Li said he had adopted two dogs who were very energetic when they went after squirrels, shooting off like artillery shells after a target.Usually, he said, dogs are cute and melt your heart, but when he sees his two dogs, he thinks of the Chinese phrase, “Able to win battles, with first-rate style.”The phrase was first used 10 years ago by Chinese leader Xi Jinping to describe planned reforms for the Chinese military, according to the China Media Project, which studies Chinese media.A government department known as Beijing’s Comprehensive Team of Law Enforcement on Cultural Market said in a statement last week it had received tips from the public about Li’s performance on May 13 and in response launched an investigation into the company Li is signed with.The law enforcement team said it would fine the company, Xiao Guo Wenhua, about $2 million (13.3 million yuan). The company did not respond to a request for comment.An officer who did not give his name at Beijing’s police headquarters declined to say whether Li was under detention or arrest, saying the investigation was continuing and the results would be publicized accordingly.Associated Pres ","{'neg': 0.033, 'neu': 0.862, 'pos': 0.105, 'compound': 0.9781}",0.9781,"Comedian Uncle Roger silenced on Chinese social media after jokes about China

Its six-sentence statement gave no details.“Operators of critical information infrastructure in China should stop purchasing products from Micron Co.,” the agency said.The United States, Europe and Japan are reducing Chinese access to advanced chipmaking and other technology they say might be used in weapons at a time when President Xi Jinping’s government has threatened to attack Taiwan and is increasingly assertive toward Japan and other neighbors.Chinese officials have warned of unspecified consequences but appear to be struggling to find ways to retaliate without hurting China’s smartphone producers and other industries and efforts to develop its own processor chip suppliers.An official review of Micron under China’s increasingly stringent information security laws was announced on April 4, hours after Japan joined Washington in imposing restrictions on Chinese access to technology to make processor chips on security grounds.Foreign companies have been rattled by police raids on two consulting firms, Bain & Co. and Capvision, and a due diligence firm, Mintz Group. Chinese authorities have declined to explain the raids but said foreign companies are obliged to obey the law.Business groups and the U.S. government have appealed to authorities to explain the newly expanded legal restrictions on information and how they will be enforced.Sunday’s announcement appeared to try to reassure foreign companies.“China firmly promotes high-level opening up to the outside world and, as long as it complies with Chinese laws and regulations, welcomes enterprises and various platform products and services from various countries to enter the Chinese market,” the cyberspace agency said.Xi accused Washington in March of trying to block China’s development. He called on the public to “dare to fight.”Despite that, Beijing has been slow to retaliate, possibly to avoid disrupting Chinese industries that assemble most of the world’s smartphones, tablet computers and other consumer electronics. They import more than $300 billion worth of foreign chips every year.Beijing is pouring billions of dollars into trying to accelerate chip development and reduce the need for foreign technology. Chinese foundries can supply low-end chips used in cars and home appliances but can’t support smartphones, artificial intelligence and other advanced applications.The conflict has prompted warnings that the world might decouple, or split into separate spheres with incompatible technology standards that mean computers, smartphones and other products from one region wouldn’t work in others. That would raise costs and slow innovation.U.S.-Chinese relations are at their lowest level in decades due to disputes over security, Beijing’s treatment of Hong Kong and Muslim ethnic minorities, territorial disputes and China’s multibillion-dollar trade surpluses.Associated Pres ","{'neg': 0.074, 'neu': 0.851, 'pos': 0.076, 'compound': 0.4949}",0.4949,"China tells tech manufacturers to stop using Micron chips, stepping up feud with the U.S.

Russia-China border town shows countries’ deepening ties02:17PrintMay 20, 2023, 10:00 AM UTCBy Janis Mackey Frayer, Dawn Liu and Jennifer JettHEIHE, China — For about 1,000 miles, China and Russia are separated by the vast Amur River — a symbol of the countries’ tense and complicated history. A Russian flag could be seen fluttering across the frozen river from the Chinese border town of Heihe. From here, the two look a lot more like friends than rivals. The two countries’ close ties were on vivid display in this trading outpost when NBC News visited recently. Trucks loaded with goods regularly crossed the Amur, known in China as the Heilong, along a new bridge linking Heihe to Blagoveschchensk, its sister city in Russia. The Russian influence in Heihe, such as the Russian-style domes or spires that top Chinese-style apartment towers, schools, museums and even some government buildings, draws tourists from all over China.People cross the road outside a mall emblazoned with Russian and Chinese inscriptions in the city of Heihe in northern China last month.Fred Dufour / NBC NewsSanctioned by the United States and allies for its war on Ukraine, Russia has found an economic lifeline in neighboring China, with which it declared a “no limits” partnership weeks before the Ukraine invasion in February 2022. Bilateral trade grew almost 30% last year, according to Chinese customs figures, and Russia was China’s top oil supplier in the first two months of the year.“It’s very obvious Russia is increasingly dependent on China, even though Russians may not like that,” said Jon Yuan Jiang, a China-Russia relations expert in Sydney.Heihe, a city of some 1.5 million people, is largely bilingual, with shop names, street signs and menus written in Chinese and Russian. Local business owners, even fruit vendors and roadside popcorn makers, greet foreigners in simple Russian, a skill they learned before the pandemic when Russian customers came in large numbers.“When the border trade was not affected by the pandemic, we could see Russians everywhere on the street, just like meeting with old friends,” a man who identified himself only by his surname, Shi, 70, told NBC News while walking his dog in a riverside park with large sculptures of Russian dolls.Between the Ukraine conflict and strict “zero-Covid” policies that China only recently ended, there have been fewer visitors from across the border, said Tang Lu, the owner of a Russian-style bar whose customers are mainly Russians.“But Chinese people also like this place, and they may sing and interact with Russians,” she said.A customer shops underneath a Russian flag in a supermarket in Heihe. Bloomberg via Getty Images fileWhile China and Russia have a long and often acrimonious relationship dating back centuries, the war in Ukraine has pushed them closer together, with China supporting Russia politically and economically and repeating Russian talking points.Chinese President Xi Jinping is trying to strike a delicate balance in his approach to the Ukraine conflict, Jiang said. China has sought to portray itself as neutral, refusing to condemn Russia’s aggression or even call it an invasion, while also calling for peace talks. Xi and Russian President Vladimir Putin, who describe each other as friends, have talked multiple times since the war began and met in Moscow last month. Meanwhile, there is no indication when Xi will speak with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, with whom he spoke late last month for the first time since the invasion.“China doesn’t really want to support Russia in Russia’s aggression against Ukraine, but China does not want Vladimir Putin to fail as well,” fearing he could be replaced with a pro-Western government, Jiang said. Chinese efforts to appear aloof from the conflict took a hit after Beijing’s ambassador to France said the countries in eastern Europe that gained independence following the Soviet Union’s fall in 1991 did not have “effective” sovereign status in international law, prompting a furious response from European officials.The cross-border bridge that links the Chinese city of Heihe with the Russian city of Blagoveshchensk.Fred Dufour / NBC NewsChina appeared to downplay Lu’s remarks, affirming the former Soviet nations’ sovereignty and emphasizing its preferred role as an honest broker in the war.A major reason China has avoided supporting Russia too openly, Jiang said, is it doesn’t want to jeopardize its vision of a multipolar international order that is less dominated by the United States. It especially wants to avoid alienating Europe, which also aspires to a larger global role.“If China is still trying to have a multipolar world, China needs the support of the E.U.,” he said.For that same reason, Jiang said he did not think China would provide Russia with lethal military assistance, which the Biden administration has warned Beijing against. Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang said this month that China would not sell weapons to either side in the war. China has tried to position itself as a potential peacemaker in Ukraine, releasing a 12-point proposal in February that the West has dismissed as too favorable to Russia. The attempts at mediation are part of a broader effort by Xi to present himself as a global statesman and China as an alternative to American power. Last month, Beijing brokered a surprise deal between Saudi Arabia and Iran to restore diplomatic ties for the first time in seven years.China’s Xi visits Putin in Moscow to underline ‘no-limits’ friendshipMarch 21, 202301:07Experts say the shifts in the China-Russia relationship have mostly been to China’s benefit. Western sanctions have made Russia more dependent on China’s currency, the yuan, which Beijing is trying to internationalize. The yuan has replaced the U.S. dollar as the most traded currency on the Moscow Exchange, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, and Bangladesh recently agreed to use yuan to pay for a nuclear plant Russia is building in the South Asian country, Reuters reported.Russia’s growing isolation has also created opportunities for Chinese companies. With tech giants like Apple and Samsung having reduced their operations in the country, more than 70% of Russia’s smartphones now come from Chinese manufacturers like Xiaomi, Reuters reported, citing a statement from the consumer electronics retailer M.Video-Eldorado.But the war in Ukraine still casts a big shadow in border towns like Heihe.“I was in shock and disbelief when the war broke out,” said Shi, the resident in the park. “After all, the war can only bring harm to the people of two countries. I wish the war can end as soon as possible.”CORRECTION (May 20, 2023, 5:45 p.m. ET) A previous version of this article misstated the timing of when Chinese President Xi Jinping and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy were last in contact.

A Western official confirmed to NBC News that Zelenskyy is expected to attend the summit in person.In the run-up to the G-7 summit, participants had expected him to appear at least virtually. But until Friday, there had been no confirmation that he would make the potentially dangerous trip from Kyiv, the furthest he will have traveled from his country since last year's invasion.Biden joined other world leaders to lay wreaths at the Peace Memorial Park in Hiroshima on Friday. Japan has sought to ensure that the symbolic location will mean a focus on arms control.Pool via AFP - Getty ImagesAsked if President Joe Biden would have a face-to-face meeting with Zelenskyy at the summit, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters, “I think it’s a safe bet that President Biden will meet him, but I don’t have a formal announcement of that.”John Kirby, a spokesman for the White House’s National Security Council, earlier said that Zelenskyy ""was always going to participate in the G-7 in some form or fashion.""""It's really important right now, at this inflection point in the war in Ukraine, that G-7 leaders hear directly from him about conditions on the ground and what he needs going forward,"" Kirby said.A charismatic presence in his trademark green fatigues, Zelenskyy will presumably make the case that his nation’s survival hinges on a continued flow of money and sophisticated weaponry from the United States and its allies. Before heading to Japan, he was in Saudi Arabia for the Arab League summit Friday, seeking closer ties with countries beyond the West. He then heads to the G-7 summit that has already agreed on new steps to make the war costlier for Russia. Biden attended a working luncheon Friday focused on the conflict — with papers spread across a round table and flags of each country in the background. Present were the leaders of Japan, Germany, France, Italy, Canada, the United Kingdom, the European Commission and the European Council.Ukraine's Zelenskyy tells Arab League leaders that Russia is 'weak'May 19, 202301:00A subsequent joint statement released by the G-7 leaders laid out a series of new sanctions. Looking to undercut the Kremlin's war-making capacity, the nations agreed to restrict exports to Russia that include industrial machinery, tools and technology.“We will starve Russia of G-7 technology, industrial equipment and services that support its war machine,” the statement reads.Biden later tweeted, ""In lockstep with my fellow G7 Leaders, we’ve placed on Russia the largest set of sanctions and export control actions ever imposed on a major economy.""""Today, we’re taking more action — disrupting Russia’s ability to source inputs for its war, closing evasion loopholes, restricting their access to the international finance system, and reducing reliance on Russian energy,"" Biden added.Ahead of the summit, a Biden official speaking on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on the record, said, “Our commitment to continue tightening the screws on Russia remains as strong as it was last year.”But recent polling shows that Americans are tiring of the war and are eager to see an end date. Russia failed to swiftly conquer its smaller neighbor but has given no sign that it is prepared to withdraw its forces. Nor is Kyiv about to surrender. Ukraine is readying a counteroffensive to retake occupied land and showcase the difference Western support can make on the battlefield.Biden, who last saw Zelenskyy in person during a surprise trip to Kyiv three months ago, vowed at the time that the U.S. would stand with Ukraine for “as long as it takes.”Zelenskyy was greeted by Saudi officials upon his arrival in Jeddah on Friday.Saudi Press Agency / APThat open-ended commitment will test the resolve and patience of Americans in an election season, as the Biden administration spends billions to help keep Ukraine in the fight. The war figures to be an issue in the 2024 presidential race. Republican front-runner Donald Trump has stopped short of saying he wants Ukraine to win and told a recent CNN town hall that, if elected, he’d end the conflict in 24 hours by meeting with Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin.An unexpected domestic problem has intruded on Biden's trip: the debt ceiling fight back in Washington. Biden had originally planned to visit Papua New Guinea and Australia as part of an effort to rally U.S allies and curb China's growing influence in the Pacific. He canceled those legs of the trip so that he could return to the White House on Sunday and resume talks over raising the debt ceiling and averting an unprecedented default that could have global implications. Biden left a group dinner a little early Friday to get an update from his negotiating team, the White House said.Biden not closing the door on sending fighter jets to Ukraine, Kirby saysMay 18, 202301:51""It's a minor miracle that Biden went ahead with the trip to Hiroshima,"" said Daniel Russel, former director of Asian affairs in the Obama White House. ""I'm glad he did and we should all pray that this gets wrapped up, because the consequences would be devastating -- and not only for the U.S. Everyone is concerned,"" he said referring to the debt ceiling fight.Beyond sanctions, Zelenskyy has asked for advanced F-16s to help repel Russian forces. The U.S. and its allies now plan to provide the fighter jets to Ukraine, a senior Biden administration official said Friday, although they may not necessarily come directly from the United States.For months, the Biden administration has declined to provide the planes out of concern that weapons capable of reaching Russian soil would risk escalating the war. But the U.S. has invited Ukrainian pilots to train on simulators to assess how long it would take them to learn to fly the aircraft.At the summit, Zelenskyy will have a fresh opportunity to engage with allies.“It’s very helpful,"" Russel said of Zelenskyy's visit. ""If the industrialized countries get Ukraine fatigue before Russia gets war fatigue and tired of fighting, then there’s going to be a big problem. Zelenskyy has been brilliant in ensuring that the world sees the situation for what it is, and that it doesn’t burn out and get tired.”The summit's location is symbolic of the mortal threat that is an everyday concern for Ukraine, as well as Asian countries living in the shadow of nuclear-armed China and North Korea.During World War II, the U.S. leveled Hiroshima with a single atomic bomb. On Friday morning, Biden and his counterparts toured the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum and met a woman who survived the attack.In the park outside, the leaders laid wreaths and planted a tree overlooking the skeletal remains of a once-domed building that Japan has preserved as a reminder of the bomb's toll.Peter NicholasPeter Nicholas is a senior national political reporter for NBC News.Kristen WelkerKristen Welker is chief White House correspondent for NBC News.Peter AlexanderPeter Alexander is chief White House correspondent for NBC News.Sally Bronston, Daryna Mayer and Yuliya Talmazan contributed ","{'neg': 0.092, 'neu': 0.803, 'pos': 0.106, 'compound': 0.8046}",0.8046,"Russia hit with new sanctions as Zelenskyy is set to join world leaders at G-7 summit in Japan

He will also attend a meeting of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation trade ministers during his trip.In recent years, top U.S. and China commerce officials have rarely held meetings. Wang last spoke to Raimondo in 2021 in an introductory call, and he spoke with Tai on the sidelines of last year's APEC meeting. Tensions between the two superpowers have escalated under the Biden and Trump administrations, and relations in recent months have been further strained by the 200-foot-tall Chinese airship, which the U.S. called a spy balloon designed for eavesdropping.Still, the U.S. and China remain important trade partners. In 2022, bilateral trade hit a historic high of nearly $760 billion, according to the embassy briefing.""This fully demonstrates the strong complementarity between the two countries and resilience of the economic and trade relationship,"" Liu said. ""This bilateral relationship cannot be simplistically defined by 'competition.""Representatives for Raimondo and Tai did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The expected trade talks next week come after NBC News reported last month that a breakdown in communication between Washington and Beijing is raising the risk of an unintended crisis or conflict between the two nations.Rose HorowitchRose Horowitch is an intern with NBC News Digital Politics.

Australian woman, 95, is in critical condition after police fired stun gun at her02:22PrintMay 19, 2023, 2:00 PM UTCBy Lyme ChoA 95-year-old woman is in critical condition after police in Australia shocked her with a stun gun as she approached them with a walking frame and a steak knife at her nursing home.  Clare Nowland, who has dementia, was taken down by a senior constable, Peter Cotter, the assistant commissioner of New South Wales Police told a news conference Friday. At the time, ""she was approaching police, but it is fair to say at a slow pace,” he said. “She had a walking frame, but she had a knife.”He added that an internal investigation had been launched into the incident Wednesday at the Yallambee Lodge nursing home in Cooma, a small town around 240 miles south of Sydney.        After responding to a call about a patient having a knife in her possession, Cotter said Nowland was found in a “small confined” treatment room by two officers who arrived at the scene.Police fired a stun gun at Clare Nowland, 95, in a care home.Reuters TV“Negotiations commenced for her to drop the knife. For whatever reasons, Clare did not do that,” he said, adding that the senior constable activated his stun gun, which are widely known as Tasers after a major manufacturer. “I can’t take it any further as to what was going through anyone’s mind,” Cotter said.   The 5-foot-2 woman, who weighs 95 pounds, fell to the ground and struck her head.   Paramedics transferred Nowland to a nearby hospital where her head injury has rendered her bedridden. “She remains in and out of consciousness,” Cotter said.He added that she had left her bedroom and obtained the knife from the kitchen at Yallambee Lodge, a 93-room facility which “offers a range of accommodation and support options for those with higher care needs, dementia and respite care for both individuals and couples,” according to its website.NBC News has reached out to Yallambee Lodge for comment. Community advocate Andrew Thaler, who is assisting the family, said Friday that they were “shocked, confused, angry, and hurt” by the incident.“There was nothing she could do with the knife,” he said. “I bet all she could do was hurt herself. The police and the nurses are trained to treat people with dementia, if they can’t do that, why is she there?”The Yallambee Lodge facility in Cooma, Australia.Lukas Coch / APNowland, a long-standing member of the community, ran charity shops, was a regular churchgoer and cooked meals for the other elderly people through outreach work, Thaler said.“Clare is one of the ladies who gave more than she got,” he added. Thaler said her family of eight children and more than 60 grandchildren and great-grandchildren knew she was “old and at the end of her life line, but to suddenly have it cut short and ruined in such a way is shocking and confronting.” “It’s absurd,” he added.Cotter refused to answer any questions about criminal charges for the officer, but confirmed that he had served 12 years on the force. He added that the officer was “nonoperational at this stage while he is under review.” “Not one of our officers is above the law, and all our actions will be scrutinized robustly from a criminal and departmental perspective,” he said.The investigation was nominated a level 1 incident, which classifies injuries that lead to death or imminent death with exceptional circumstances. The classification ensures the highest level of inquiry with the inclusion of a homicide squad.“Critical incidents are a matter we are always transparent on,” Cotter said.Two police body cameras captured the incident, forming “a significant and integral part of the investigation,” but it will not be released because “it is not in the public interest,” he added. The investigation will be ultimately reviewed by the professional standards command of the South Wales Police Force, Cotter said, with oversight by the Law Enforcement Conduct Commission of New South Wales.Lyme ChoLyme Cho is an intern for NBC News based in London ","{'neg': 0.093, 'neu': 0.86, 'pos': 0.047, 'compound': -0.9908}",-0.9908,"Police taser a 95-year-old woman with dementia in Australia

In July 2021, the company was fined 200,000 yuan for publishing advertisements that featured a comedian endorsing a lingerie brand with comments said to objectify women.Reuter ","{'neg': 0.062, 'neu': 0.792, 'pos': 0.146, 'compound': 0.9925}",0.9925,"A costly joke: China slaps comedy firm with $2 million fine for military gag

McCaul had threatened to hold Blinken in contempt of Congress for not turning over the classified document.""In light of this invitation, I will pause efforts to enforce the Committee’s subpoena pending my review of the documents,"" McCaul wrote. ""Please note, however, that the subpoena remains in full force and effect, and the acceptance of this accommodation does not waive any of the Committee’s rights regarding the subpoena.""He also insisted on ""allowing other Members to review the dissent cable and response.""Rep. Gregory Meeks of New York, the top Democrat on the Foreign Affairs Committee, will be allowed to view the documents with McCaul.The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on McCaul's letter.The State Department has made various counteroffers to McCaul's March subpoena, including providing a written summary of the cable’s contents in addition to a classified briefing. McCaul, however, has insisted that the committee receive a full copy of the cable, as well as Blinken’s response to it.The U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan was widely viewed as chaotic. A deadly attack at Abbey Gate at Kabul International Airport resulted in the deaths of 13 U.S. service members and 170 Afghan civilians.The Biden administration has blown past three deadlines for a congressional subpoena for the dissent cable, arguing that providing the sensitive memo to Congress would deter diplomats from using the channel to voice opposing views.The State Department said Wednesday it would let the top two members of the Foreign Affairs Committee — McCaul and Meeks — view the 2021 cable, according to a letter obtained by NBC News.“The accommodations that the Department has provided to date are extraordinary and, as stated in our prior correspondence, already create a serious risk of chilling both future use of, and future candor in, Dissent Channel cables,” said the letter from the assistant secretary for legislative affairs, Naz Durakoglu, which called the latest proposal “extraordinary.”The letter added that the State Department’s offer was contingent on the committee’s suspending all enforcement actions related to the subpoena, including dropping the threat to hold Blinken in contempt.McCaul on Wednesday called the offer “a significant step forward” but did not drop his contempt threat.Vedant Patel, a State Department spokesperson, defended the department's engagement Thursday.“I think it is natural in these discussions for there to be deliberations and accommodations about the path forward. I’m certainly not going to speculate and hypothesize on how we continue to further engage with the committee,” Patel told reporters. “What I will reiterate, though, is that at every turn we have offered tangible, fair and realistic accommodations that we think have sufficiently met and continue to sufficiently meet the committee’s request for information.”Abigail WilliamsAbigail Williams is a producer and reporter for NBC News covering the State Department.Ryan NoblesKate SantalizKate Santaliz is a researcher for NBC News’ Capitol Hill team.Megan Lebowit ","{'neg': 0.03, 'neu': 0.91, 'pos': 0.06, 'compound': 0.9623}",0.9623,"GOP lawmaker hits pause on enforcing subpoena for 2021 Afghanistan cable

Those include publications about the bloody crackdown and others written by pro-democracy politicians and political commentators.Hong Kong is a former British colony that returned to China’s rule in 1997, promising to retain its Western-style freedoms. But the city’s cultural and creative sectors said the city’s freedoms have shrunk since Beijing imposed a tough national security law following massive pro-democracy protests in 2019.Critics said the book pulling would further undermine Hong Kong’s reputation for having free access to information and freedom of expression.But Lee defended the sweeping law at the legislature, saying Hong Kong’s freedoms are protected by the city’s constitution.“The books we offer for residents to borrow are those that we recommend,” he said. “We would never recommend books that are illegal and violate copyrights. We would never recommend those that we deem to be featuring bad ideologies.”He said residents could still find such books to read elsewhere. He did not elaborate on what was considered “bad ideologies” and why the books were removed.Asked why the books were removed, the Leisure and Cultural Services Department said public libraries review and withdraw materials that do not conform to “the collection development” from time to time. If any material is suspected of being contrary to the interests of national security or violating laws, the libraries will immediately suspend services of the material in question for review, it said.The removal of the books was reported by local media outlets after a Chinese newspaper stopped publishing works by the city’s most prominent political cartoonist on Sunday following government complaints. Comic strip collections by the cartoonist were also no longer available in public libraries.Political scholar Ivan Choy said one book he co-authored was pulled despite a previous endorsement by former Secretary for Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Stephen Lam. Lam wrote the foreword for the title and said it was the most comprehensive book on the city’s electoral system, Choy said.“We wrote this book as academics and are not trying to make any political statements. So I feel they have overreacted,” he said.After the books were pulled and the publication of political cartoons halted, Choy questioned how Hong Kong could still stay as an international metropolitan without being broad-minded and inclusive. He added China wants Hong Kong to become an international cultural exchange center, where the East meets the West.He said the changes keep Hong Kong from living up to its reputation.Since a sweeping security law was enacted in 2020, the city’s art and media communities have learned to be wary of crossing vaguely defined red lines in producing art and other content that might be perceived as challenging the Chinese Communist Party’s control.The group that organized Hong Kong’s annual vigil in remembrance of the Tiananmen Square crackdown also voted to disband in 2021 under the shadow of the security law. The annual vigil was the only large-scale public commemoration of the event on Chinese soil and was attended by massive crowds until authorities banned it in 2020, citing anti-pandemic measures.Supporters say the group’s closure shows that the freedoms and autonomy promised when Hong Kong returned to China in 1997 are diminishing.This year, a massive vigil is unlikely to take place in its usual spot, Victoria Park in Causeway Bay, on June 4. Instead, some pro-Beijing groups will host a bazaar to celebrate the city’s handover to Chinese rule there.Associated Pres ","{'neg': 0.073, 'neu': 0.841, 'pos': 0.086, 'compound': 0.894}",0.894,"Hong Kong leader defends removing politically sensitive books from public libraries

Chaudary / APPrintMay 17, 2023, 6:33 PM UTC / Source: Associated PressBy Associated PressPolice surrounded the home of former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan on Wednesday, claiming he was sheltering dozens of people allegedly involved in violent protests over his recent detention.The police deployment was likely to anger Khan’s many followers and raised concerns about more clashes between them and the security forces. Last week, Khan supporters had attacked public property and military installations after he was dragged out of a courtroom and detained.The popular opposition leader was released over the weekend and returned to his home in an upscale district of Lahore, Pakistan’s second largest city and the capital of the Punjab region.On Wednesday, Khan took to Twitter after 200 police officers surrounded the house, and a prison van appeared on the scene.“Probably my last tweet before my next arrest,” Khan tweeted. “ Police have surrounded my house.”Earlier on Wednesday, Amir Mir, a spokesman for the Punjab provincial government, said Khan has 24 hours to hand over 40 suspects allegedly hiding at his home or face a police raid. Mir told a news conference that so far 3,400 suspects have been arrested and that more raids are planned.Pakistani authorities have said they would prosecute civilians involved in recent anti-government protests in military courts.K.M. Chaudary / APPakistani authorities have said they would prosecute civilians involved in recent anti-government protests in military courts. The army chief, Gen. Asim Munir, said in a speech to troops Wednesday that “recently planned and orchestrated tragic incidents will never be allowed again at any cost.”The advocacy group Amnesty International and the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan said they were alarmed by the government’s plan.Dinushika Dissanayake, Amnesty’s deputy regional director for South Asia, said that trying civilians in military courts is contrary to international law.Military trials in Pakistan are usually held behind closed doors, depriving civilians of some of their basic rights, including contracting a lawyer of their choice.A wave of violence had engulfed Pakistan’s capital and other urban areas following Khan’s dramatic arrest from a courtroom. Khan supporters torched buildings and vehicles and attacked police and military personnel and facilities. Ten people were killed in the clashes, and more than 4,000 were arrested.The Supreme Court later ordered Khan’s release and criticized the way he was arrested.On Wednesday, a top court in Islamabad extended Khan’s bail and protection from arrest until the end of the month. However, his legal team fears he might be arrested in old cases.Imran Khan granted bail, leaves high court amid tight securityMay 12, 202300:47Khan, 70, was ousted by a non-confidence vote in parliament last year. He is currently facing more than 100 cases, mainly on charges of inciting people to violence, threatening officials, and defying a ban on rallies. He also faces a graft case along with his wife.In recent days, the government of Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif has accused Khan of sheltering suspects linked to last week’s attacks.Khan, meanwhile, alleged some of his supporters were being tortured in police custody and demanded the immediate release of female detainees. He offered no evidence to back those claims.In a speech Wednesday, Khan said he never encouraged his supporters to engage in violence.

But this is not a choice we are in a position to make. Because China has already embarked on a self-reliance drive, whether we want to decouple from their economy or not,” Truss said in an address to the Prospect Foundation at a hotel in the Taiwanese capital, Taipei.“China is growing its navy at an alarming rate and is undertaking the biggest military build-up in peacetime history,” she said.“They have already formed alliances with other nations that want to see the free world in decline. They have already made a choice about their strategy. The only choice we have is whether we appease and accommodate — or we take action to prevent conflict,” Truss said.Elsewhere, Truss praised her successor, Rishi Sunak, for describing China as “the biggest long-term threat to Britain” in comments last summer and for urging the closure of Chinese government-run cultural centers known as Confucius Institutes, which have been criticized as outlets for Communist Party propaganda. Such services could instead be provided by people from Taiwan and Hong Kong who come to the United Kingdom of their own volition.In Beijing, spokesperson for the Cabinet’s Taiwan Affairs Office Mao Xiaoguang accused Taiwan’s ruling Democratic Progressive Party of “spending the tax money of the Taiwanese people to bribe some anti-China politicians who have stepped down from office to stage a farce of seeking external support for independence in Taiwan.”Liz Truss with Taiwan Foreign Minister Joseph Wu upon her arrival at the Taoyuan airport Tuesday.APMa also renewed China’s military threats against Taiwan, a day after the Chinese Defense Ministry condemned U.S. military assistance to the island.“If they continue to challenge and force us, we will have to take decisive measures to defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity,” Ma told reporters at a biweekly news conference. “No one should underestimate our strong determination, unwavering will and strong ability.”Next year is seen by some as a crucial period for tense relations between the sides, with U.S. and Taiwanese voters going to the polls. Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen has served the maximum two terms and Vice President Lai Ching-te, a strong independence supporter, will be running for the DPP.Meanwhile, the main opposition Nationalist Party, or Kuomintang, on Wednesday nominated local politician Hou Yu-ih as its candidate in the January election. Hou rose to prominence as a top police official but has relatively little experience dealing with China and Taiwan’s international partners.Taiwan will also elect a new legislature, which is currently controlled by the ruling party.China’s relations with Britain and most other Western democracies have been in steep decline in recent years, largely as a result of disputes over human rights, trade technology and China’s aggressive moves toward Taiwan and in the South China Sea.Beijing’s relations with London have been especially bitter over China’s sweeping crackdown on free speech, democracy and other civil liberties in Hong Kong, a former British colony that was promised it would retain its freedoms after the handover to Chinese rule in 1997.China has said a key previous bilateral agreement on Hong Kong no longer applies and has rejected British expressions of concern as interference in China’s domestic political affairs. China has also been angered by a joint Australian-U.S.-British agreement known as AUKUS that would provide Australia with nuclear-powered submarines in part to counter the perceived rising threat from China.Truss, who served an ill-fated seven weeks as prime minister last year, also said China could not be trusted to follow through on its commitments in areas from trade to protection of the environment.And she praised Taiwan as “an enduring rebuke to totalitarianism” whose fate was a “core interest” to Europe.“A blockade or invasion of Taiwan would undermine freedom and democracy in Europe. Just as a Russian victory in Ukraine would undermine freedom and democracy in the Pacific,” Truss said.“We in the United Kingdom and the free world must do all we can to back you,” she said.Truss’ remarks also stood in stark contrast to published comments from French President Emmanuel Macron last month that elicited doubts about whether Macron’s views were in line with other European countries on Taiwan’s status.“The question we need to answer, as Europeans, is the following: Is it in our interest to accelerate (a crisis) on Taiwan? No,” Macron was quoted as saying in the interview. “The worst thing would be to think that we Europeans must become followers on this topic and take our cue from the U.S. agenda and a Chinese overreaction.”Shortly afterward, Macron denied any change on France’s views toward Taiwan, saying, “We are for the status quo, and this policy is constant.”Associated Pres ","{'neg': 0.088, 'neu': 0.799, 'pos': 0.113, 'compound': 0.9853}",0.9853,"Former British Prime Minister Liz Truss warns of China threats during Taiwan visit

For now it’s 100% confirmed that Kami Rita scaled for the 27th time,” Guragai said.Kami Rita, who refers to himself by his first names, scaled Everest for the first time in 1994 and has climbed it almost every year since then, except in 2014, 2015 and 2020, when climbing was halted for various reasons.Garrett Madison of the U.S.-based Madison Mountaineering company, who has climbed Everest 12 times, five of them with Kami Rita, described him as a “very strong climber.”“Very inspirational to see a local climber continue pushing the limits on Mount Everest,” Madison told Reuters by telephone from Everest’s base camp, where he is preparing for a 13th ascent.Mount Everest, the highest mountain in the world at 8,849 metres, in Nepal's Himalayan Range. Sebastien Berger / AFP - Getty Images fileKami Rita, who comes from Thame village in the Solukhumbu district, home to Everest and other peaks, could not be reached for comment as he was descending to lower camps on Wednesday.His company said in a statement he had “dedicated his life to mountaineering and has become synonymous with the world’s highest peak”.Sherpas are known for their climbing skills and many make a living guiding foreign clients up Everest and other mountains.May is the ideal time for tying to reach the top of Everest, with clear weather before the monsoon arrives from the south, bringing cloud and snow to the peaks and rain to the low lands.This year, Nepal has issued 478 permits, the most ever, for people to climb Everest compared with the previous record of 408 in 2021.The Himalayan nation, which is heavily reliant on climbing, trekking and tourism for foreign exchange, has been criticized for allowing too many climbers, many of them inexperienced, to try for Everest’s summit.Dangerous overcrowding can develop, especially at a bottleneck called the Hillary Step, just below the summit. In 2019, nine exhausted climbers died on Everest after queues built up of climbers going up and down.Everest has been climbed more than 11,000 times, from both the Nepali and Tibetan sides, since it was first scaled in 1953, with many people going up multiple times.More than 320 people have died on the mountain, hiking officials said.Reuter ","{'neg': 0.036, 'neu': 0.924, 'pos': 0.041, 'compound': 0.501}",0.501,"Nepali sherpa sets Mount Everest record with 27th ascent

Both describe themselves as Russian dissidents and have members who espoused white nationalist views. The Russian Volunteer Corps, or RVC, says it’s made up of Russians fighting on Ukraine’s side and against Putin's government. The group made headlines in March when it claimed to be behind a smaller raid in the Bryansk region.Its commander, Denis Kapustin, who also goes by the last name of Nikitin, is a white nationalist and ex-soccer hooligan who shares neo-Nazi views. Kapustin is listed on Russia’s federal wanted list and its register of extremists and terrorists.The U.S.-based Anti-Defamation League has described Kapustin as “a Russian neo-Nazi who lived in Germany for many years.” He goes by the call sign “White Rex” and reportedly founded a clothing brand of the same name that is popular among Russian neo-Nazis. The RVC’s channel on the Telegram messaging app has more than 110,000 followers and has shared photos of what it says are the group’s fighters on the war's front lines.Some of their posts have anti-immigration and pro-white European rhetoric. In a post on Tuesday, the group clarified that it “adheres to right-wing conservative political views and traditionalist beliefs.”The group says that it consists of mostly volunteers, ethnic Russians and Russian citizens living in Ukraine, who have fought for Kyiv since 2014.The founder of the Russian Volunteer Corps, Denis Kapustin, flanked by fighters in northern Ukraine, not far from the Russian border, on Wednesday.Sergey Bobok / AFP - Getty ImagesThe Freedom of Russia Legion is the other group that claims to have been involved, and also portrays itself as Russians who are fighting for Ukraine and against Putin. The legion says on its website that it was formed last spring “out of the wish of the Russians themselves to fight against Putin’s armed gang in the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.” The group calls on Russian soldiers and officers to join them in the fight for “Free Russia.”It claims to be officially recognized by Ukraine’s army, and fighting “under the leadership of the Ukrainian command.”The group was banned as a terrorist organization by Russia’s Supreme Court in March. No particular names of leaders or people affiliated with the Legion are shared on the group’s site. But a man nicknamed “Caesar” has appeared in videos as its de facto spokesperson. “We are Russians, just like you,” he said in a video on Monday ahead of the raid, as he decried corruption and Putin’s crackdown of civil liberties. “We are coming home,” he said. The Legion said in March that Russia started a criminal case against “Caesar,” without identifying his real name. The Legion also has a strong presence on Telegram, with more than a quarter million subscribers, where they call themselves “free citizens of Russia.”Earlier this month, RVC vowed to fight in tandem with the Legion “despite a different ideological base.” It’s not clear how many fighters there are in either group.“The Russian Volunteer Corps does seem especially heavily drawn from Russian nationalists and neo-Nazis, while the Legion appears less politically-aligned,” Mark Galeotti, who heads the Russia-focused consultancy Mayak Intelligence, told NBC News. “They share a desire to see the Putin regime fall and believe a Ukrainian victory is the best way to further this goal,” Galeotti said. What's their motivation?Kapustin, the commander of the RVC, told the press near the Russian border Wednesday that his group makes no secret of some of its members’ right-wing views, but he doesn’t think that being called a neo-Nazi is an insult. “You will never find me waving a flag with a swastika, you will never find me, I don’t know, raising my hand in a Hitler salute,” he said.Sporting a goatee and all-black military fatigues, Kapustin touted the success of the Belgorod raid and said a wider operation was being planned. The group says that it fully recognizes Ukraine’s territorial integrity and considers Putin’s war in Ukraine “criminal.” It lists the “overthrow of the ruling regime in Russia” as one of its objectives. Meanwhile, Alexei Baranovsky, the spokesperson for the political wing of the Legion, told Reuters the incursion was “the first steps in the main objective of overthrowing Putin’s regime through armed force.”In a post on the group’s Telegram channel on Wednesday the Legion vowed to return soon. “Belgorod, Bryansk, Kursk, Voronezh, Rostov, Moscow — wait for us,” the post said. The group’s manifesto calls Putin’s regime “dictatorial,” and says they are fighting against him and “for true freedom for every Russian.” It also calls on both ethnic Russians and minorities in the country to rise against the Russian leader.“It’s clear that Freedom of Russia Legion and Russian Volunteer Corps are both predominantly Russian groups — self-styled ‘partisans’ trying to bring the Putin government down and that they range from the soccer-thug neo-Nazis to the wannabe celebrities and even to some semi-serious political reformers,” said Michael Clarke, visiting professor of war studies at King’s College London. “They are not ‘liberals’, but rather hard line Russian nationalists —  just not of the Putin variety,” Clarke added.NBC News has reached out for comment to both groups, but they did not immediately respond. Anti-Putin fighters appear to use American equipment in attack on RussiaMay 25, 202302:00What’s their connection to Ukraine? The Kremlin does not dispute that some of the fighters involved in the incursion this week could be ethnically Russian, but sees them as “Ukrainian militants, coming from Ukraine,” according to spokesman Dmitry Peskov. Ukraine has denied it’s connected to actions by either group, framing them as “Russian patriots” who decided to rise up against the Kremlin. The groups’ extreme views and evidence that the fighters involved in this week’s raid appeared to use American armored vehicles has raised questions for Washington, which has sought to ensure that equipment sent to Kyiv is not used in attacks on Russian soil.Andriy Yusov, a spokesman for Ukraine’s military intelligence directorate, told NBC News the incursion was carried out “exclusively by citizens of the Russian Federation” who had acted “completely autonomously” and that Ukraine did not coordinate with them. Baranovsky, of the Legion, said the unit was part of Ukraine’s international brigade, but denied the incursion was coordinated with Ukrainian authorities.But Kapustin, the RVC commander, said Ukraine “encouraged” the group’s actions in Belgorod, and that they “consult” on their actions with Ukraine’s military, though he said anything they do outside the country’s borders “is our own decision.”Experts also questioned Kyiv’s narrative that it was a purely Russian affair. “There’s no question really that the Russian volunteer units are armed and controlled by Ukraine,” Galeotti said. “Although it suits Kyiv to pretend that this was simply a venture by Russian patriots, it would only have been carried out by GUR’s orders, or at least with its approval,” he added, referring to the intelligence branch of Ukraine’s defense ministry.Yuliya TalmazanYuliya Talmazan is a London-based journalist.Reuters contributed

crackdown of civil liberties. “We are coming home,” he said. The Legion said in March that Russia started a criminal case against “Caesar,” without identifying his real name. The Legion also has a strong presence on Telegram, with more than a quarter million subscribers, where they call themselves “free citizens of Russia.”Earlier this month, RVC vowed to fight in tandem with the Legion “despite a different ideological base.” It’s not clear how many fighters there are in either group.“The Russian Volunteer Corps does seem especially heavily drawn from Russian nationalists and neo-Nazis, while the Legion appears less politically-aligned,” Mark Galeotti, who heads the Russia-focused consultancy Mayak Intelligence, told NBC News. “They share a desire to see the Putin regime fall and believe a Ukrainian victory is the best way to further this goal,” Galeotti said. What's their motivation?Kapustin, the commander of the RVC, told the press near the Russian border Wednesday that his group makes no secret of some of its members’ right-wing views, but he doesn’t think that being called a neo-Nazi is an insult. “You will never find me waving a flag with a swastika, you will never find me, I don’t know, raising my hand in a Hitler salute,” he said.Sporting a goatee and all-black military fatigues, Kapustin touted the success of the Belgorod raid and said a wider operation was being planned. The group says that it fully recognizes Ukraine’s territorial integrity and considers Putin’s war in Ukraine “criminal.” It lists the “overthrow of the ruling regime in Russia” as one of its objectives. Meanwhile, Alexei Baranovsky, the spokesperson for the political wing of the Legion, told Reuters the incursion was “the first steps in the main objective of overthrowing Putin’s regime through armed force.”In a post on the group’s Telegram channel on Wednesday the Legion vowed to return soon. “Belgorod, Bryansk, Kursk, Voronezh, Rostov, Moscow — wait for us,” the post said. The group’s manifesto calls Putin’s regime “dictatorial,” and says they are fighting against him and “for true freedom for every Russian.” It also calls on both ethnic Russians and minorities in the country to rise against the Russian leader.“It’s clear that Freedom of Russia Legion and Russian Volunteer Corps are both predominantly Russian groups — self-styled ‘partisans’ trying to bring the Putin government down and that they range from the soccer-thug neo-Nazis to the wannabe celebrities and even to some semi-serious political reformers,” said Michael Clarke, visiting professor of war studies at King’s College London. “They are not ‘liberals’, but rather hard line Russian nationalists —  just not of the Putin variety,” Clarke added.NBC News has reached out for comment to both groups, but they did not immediately respond. Anti-Putin fighters appear to use American equipment in attack on RussiaMay 25, 202302:00What’s their connection to Ukraine? The Kremlin does not dispute that some of the fighters involved in the incursion this week could be ethnically Russian, but sees them as “Ukrainian militants, coming from Ukraine,” according to spokesman Dmitry Peskov. Ukraine has denied it’s connected to actions by either group, framing them as “Russian patriots” who decided to rise up against the Kremlin. The groups’ extreme views and evidence that the fighters involved in this week’s raid appeared to use American armored vehicles has raised questions for Washington, which has sought to ensure that equipment sent to Kyiv is not used in attacks on Russian soil.Andriy Yusov, a spokesman for Ukraine’s military intelligence directorate, told NBC News the incursion was carried out “exclusively by citizens of the Russian Federation” who had acted “completely autonomously” and that Ukraine did not coordinate with them. Baranovsky, of the Legion, said the unit was part of Ukraine’s international brigade, but denied the incursion was coordinated with Ukrainian authorities.But Kapustin, the RVC commander, said Ukraine “encouraged” the group’s actions in Belgorod, and that they “consult” on their actions with Ukraine’s military, though he said anything they do outside the country’s borders “is our own decision.”Experts also questioned Kyiv’s narrative that it was a purely Russian affair. “There’s no question really that the Russian volunteer units are armed and controlled by Ukraine,” Galeotti said. “Although it suits Kyiv to pretend that this was simply a venture by Russian patriots, it would only have been carried out by GUR’s orders, or at least with its approval,” he added, referring to the intelligence branch of Ukraine’s defense ministry.Yuliya TalmazanYuliya Talmazan is a London-based journalist.Reuters contributed

The presence of the suspicious computer code was announced Wednesday by Microsoft in a warning it issued to private sector users of its software. The U.S. territory of Guam is the location of a critical Marine base that would respond to China if it attacked Taiwan. The National Security Agency also issued an alert to electrical utilities, nuclear power stations, water systems, railways and other key sectors that could be vulnerable.“The U.S. intelligence community assesses that China almost certainly is capable of launching cyberattacks that can disrupt critical infrastructure services within the United States,” State Department spokesman Matt Miller told reporters Thursday. “It’s vital for government network defenders in the public to stay vigilant.”U.S. nuclear secrets are vulnerable to spies, report saysMay 25, 202302:51The news comes as U.S. and Chinese officials are holding their first Cabinet-level meetings in Washington during the Biden administration, with Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo meeting with her counterpart, Chinese Commerce Minister Wang Wentao. U.S. officials said that the two had “candid and substantive discussions” Thursday and that Raimondo ""raised concerns"" about recent government actions against U.S. companies operating in China.U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai was also scheduled to meet with Wang. They will both also attend a meeting of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, commonly known as APEC, in Detroit on Friday and Saturday along with ministers from other countries in those regions.Asked whether the new malware could affect the economic talks, Miller said, “We do intend to use our conversations with the Chinese government to press on areas where we have concerns.” Before leaving a summit of leading industrial nations in Japan on Sunday, President Joe Biden expressed optimism that the U.S. and China would soon be able to improve bilateral relations. Tensions heightened after the U.S. shot down a Chinese spy balloon in early February off the South Carolina coast after it crossed the country from Montana to the Atlantic coast. China has maintained it was a weather balloon that had blown off course, repeating that claim most recently in meetings national security adviser Jake Sullivan held with Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang two weeks ago in Vienna. China had earlier halted regular military communications with the Pentagon to protest then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s trip to Taiwan last September. A senior U.S. official told NBC News that the two meetings with the Chinese officials in Washington could bolster Biden’s push for a diplomatic thaw between the two countries. The official suggested that a trip to China by Secretary of State Antony Blinken that was canceled after the balloon was shot down could be rescheduled by August, as well as visits by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, Raimondo and climate envoy John Kerry. But China’s Foreign Ministry reacted harshly to the hacking accusation Thursday, accusing the U.S. of working with its allies to launch a coordinated disinformation campaign.“We noted this extremely unprofessional report, a patchwork with a broken chain of evidence,” ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said. “We also noted that the U.S. National Security Agency and the cybersecurity agencies of the U.K., Australia, Canada and New Zealand, almost simultaneously issued similar reports.”Another negative signal came when China’s newly appointed ambassador to the U.S., Xie Feng, said on arrival Tuesday that “the relationship is faced with serious difficulties and challenges.” On Thursday, Feng met with Victoria Nuland, undersecretary of state for political affairs, at the State Department. Nuland tweeted a photograph of herself shaking hands with the new Chinese envoy and tried to strike an optimistic note about easing tensions, writing, “Open dialogue is critical to managing our relationship.”Andrea MitchellAndrea Mitchell is chief Washington correspondent and chief foreign affairs correspondent for NBC News.Abigail WilliamsAbigail Williams is a producer and reporter for NBC News covering the State Department.Zoë RichardsZoë Richards is the evening politics reporter for NBC News ","{'neg': 0.064, 'neu': 0.887, 'pos': 0.049, 'compound': -0.9146}",-0.9146,"Will Chinese hacking derail U.S. hopes for a thaw with Beijing

At around 230 feet tall and 50 feet wide, its physical stature was surpassed only by its status as a national symbol.Crowds gathered in the center of the capital to see the wrecked trunk for themselves. ""It was regarded as a symbol of liberty and freedom by early settlers"" in the West African country — which was founded by freed American slaves — according to President Julius Maada Bio, who joined the crowds at the site Thursday.“The Cotton Tree wasn’t just a tree,” Bio tweeted, “it was a connection between the past, present and the future.”The centuries-old Cotton Tree in Freetown in 2011.Tommy Trenchard / Alamy Stock PhotoThe great shade of the Cotton Tree had offered returning Black freed slaves a resting place and prayer ground when they arrived by boat in the 1700s, the country's Ministry of Tourism and Cultural Affairs said on its website. While it stood strong in the face of landslides driven by climate change and a lightning strike, a heavy downpour Wednesday night left nothing of the Cotton Tree but a stump.It was “damaged beyond repair,” said Zebek, a press agency working with Sierra Leone’s government, “its entire trunk sheared off a few metres above the ground.”The weight of the loss “is comparable with the 2019 fire that destroyed the Notre Dame cathedral in Paris,” Zebek said. A bulldozer clears the fallen Cotton Tree in downtown Freetown on Thursday.TJ Bade / APFreetown’s city structure sprung from the Cotton Tree’s central position, and the tree became a national icon that appeared on bank notes, featured in lullabies and was a stop for royalty.Queen Elizabeth II visited it in 1961 on a visit marking Sierra Leone’s independence from Britain.As Freetown transformed into an urban city over time, the Cotton Tree “remained a singular oasis of green,” Zebek said. It was a shelter not only for the people, but for vultures that served as literary inspirations for novelists like Graham Greene, who likened them to “broken umbrellas.”This historical painting, shown in 2016, is exhibited in the National Museum of Sierra Leone.Georg Berg / Alamy Stock PhotoBio said that parts of the tree would be preserved in the National Museum.The Ministry of Tourism and Cultural Affairs immediately took action to preserve the remaining trunk and urged the public against cutting away parts from the remains.The government welcomed “public debate on the future use of the site,” Zebek said, and sounded an optimistic note.“When a tree falls naturally due to extreme weather, a new life springs forward,” Bio said. “Together, we will preserve the legacy of unity, freedom and liberty of our iconic Cotton Tree.”Lyme ChoLyme Cho is an intern for NBC News based in London.Reuters and Associated Press contributed ","{'neg': 0.042, 'neu': 0.856, 'pos': 0.102, 'compound': 0.9934}",0.9934,"A tree felled in a storm leaves a nation mourning a 'great loss'

Ron DeSantis, left, and former President Donald Trump.NBC News; Getty ImagesPrintMay 26, 2023, 9:00 AM UTCBy Ben Kamisar and Scott BlandThe 2024 presidential election is just getting started — and the campaign is already raging at a faster, louder and pricier pace than ever.Republican candidates and groups have already spent almost $30 million on ads in the party's primary this year, according to data from the ad-tracking firm AdImpact. When they cross that threshold Saturday, that'll be 50 days earlier than Democrats hit that spending mark during their open presidential primary four years ago, and a full 137 days earlier than it took Republicans to cross the $30 million threshold during their last open presidential race, in October 2015. The bulk of the spending is coming from super PACs, with former President Donald Trump’s MAGA Inc. spending to blast Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and DeSantis’ Never Back Down PAC running positive spots. And the accelerated pace underlines key dynamics shaping the Republican race for the White House.Super PACs and megadonors are playing a bigger role than ever. Candidates have been taking advantage of loose campaign finance laws to prepare for this race — and sock away money to use or send to allies — for years before announcing campaigns. Most of all, the competition between Trump and DeSantis promises to be an all-out brawl like nothing seen before.“It’s a very competitive race on the Republican side to be the challenger to Trump — the dynamics are just different than they were in 2016,” said Alex Conant, a GOP strategist who served as communications director for Florida Sen. Marco Rubio's 2016 presidential campaign.""This time, Trump is trying to eliminate some of his competition early, the ‘kill them in the crib’ strategy,"" Conant continued. ""And some of the would-be challengers are trying to establish that they belong.""The pace in the 2024 GOP primary is a massive escalation from the last time Republicans had an open presidential primary. Ahead of 2016, the first dollar wasn't spent on ads until April 3, 2015. Spending hit $1 million in June, $10 million in August, $20 million in late September and $30 million in October. This year, Republican presidential ad spending hit the $1 million mark on March 25, $10 million in late April, $20 million in early May and is expected to hit $30 million on May 27. ""Inflation exists in politics too,"" Conant said. ""It's increasingly expensive to reach voters, but it’s also easier to raise money than it used to be.""Indeed, DeSantis enters the 2024 race already boasting the support of a $20 million donor: hotel magnate Robert Bigelow, per Time magazine. It could end up being the biggest super PAC donation ever in a presidential primary — except that tech billionaire Larry Ellison has given $35 million to a super PAC aligned with Sen. Tim Scott in recent years and is set to pump yet more into 2024.In terms of candidates officially announcing campaigns, the primary is just beginning, but those examples illustrate how the competition has really been underway for months or even years. Before launching his bid, Trump seeded his super PAC with tens of millions of dollars raised by one of his fundraising committees, largely from small-dollar donors, in 2021 and 2022. DeSantis appears poised to bolster his super PAC with more than $80 million that was largely raised while he was running for re-election in Florida.It's not just Trump and DeSantis, either. Former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley incubated a small-donor list in her political nonprofit for years before saying the words, ""I'm running for president."" Scott built up nearly $22 million in his Senate campaign account, all of it transferable to a presidential campaign, before officially starting his 2024 bid with launch plans that included a multimillion-dollar ad buy.All of the pre-planning helps explain why the presidential campaign has been able to accelerate so quickly compared to the last two. Candidates who can only raise a few thousand dollars maximum from each donor need time to build up funds, and the Democratic presidential field in 2020 was super PAC-averse.The ad war hadn’t really started by this point in the 2016 GOP race, either. The top spender in late May 2015 was a nonprofit, Foundation for a Secure and Prosperous America, which had spent under $400,000 attacking Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul.But much of the early 2024 spending has its roots in tactics that were field-tested in past campaigns, as politicians and political operatives explored the loosely defined boundaries of campaign finance law.Former Florida GOP Gov. Jeb Bush revolutionized presidential campaign fundraising in 2015 with a novel strategy: Before officially announcing he was a candidate, he raised $100 million into a super PAC that would go on to support his bid. Now, pre-raising super PAC funds has become a regular feature of campaigns, despite questions about whether the strategy adheres to the spirit of the law restricting how much candidates can raise from donors.Former business executive Carly Fiorina’s campaign outsourced much of its campaign operation to a super PAC supporting her candidacy. This election cycle, DeSantis’ campaign is expected to begin with more than enough resources, but Never Back Down is signaling its intention to build out a grassroots organization — traditionally the purview of the campaign proper — to augment the campaign’s operations.The maturation of these strategies meant Trump's and DeSantis' teams were ready to do battle right away this year. And it's not going to slow down anytime soon.Ben KamisarBen Kamisar is a deputy political editor in NBC's Political Unit. Scott BlandScott Bland is a senior politics editor in the NBC News Political Unit.

Graves shook hands with attendees and then sat in the front row. He was spotted earlier leaving the Hill, likely leaving little time for any side conversations between officials.Graves did not attend LSU but the school is located in his district.

""I think the president and the secretary have been very clear that that will not solve our problems now. So, yes, that is a no,"" Adeyemo said, adding that the only path forward is for Congress to raise the debt ceiling.""We don’t have a Plan B that allows us to meet the commitments we’ve made to our creditors, to our seniors, to our veterans, to the American people,"" he  said. ""The only plan we have is the one that’s worked for more than 200 years in this country, which is that the United States of America needs to pay all of its bills and pay them on time.”Share this -Link copied3h ago / 4:43 PM UTCRepublicans are getting quiet — often that means a deal is closeGarrett HaakeWith the high-stakes negotiations entering a do-or-die phase ahead of the holiday weekend, the typically buzzy and leaky GOP conference has gone quiet about the emerging deal’s outlines.“I’m not concerned about anybody making any comments right now about what they think is in or not,” McCarthy said this morning when asked about reports of a two-year deal coming together behind closed doors. “Whenever we come to an agreement, we’ll make sure we will first brief our entire conference.”Those briefings are not yet happening, with Republicans across the party’s ideological range claiming ignorance about the deal’s contours.“No smoke signals yet,” one Freedom Caucus member told NBC News — saying they had been told “nothing” specific about the deal by Republican leadership.Even typically chatty members close to the speaker have offered nothing but apologies today for how little they could share about a deal they expect to be asked to vote on next week.In Washington negotiations, silence can mean many things.

McCarthy avoided questions today about whether there'll be a two-year extension, but said that negotiators “made progress last night” and need to “make more progress now.”McCarthy's House-passed bill included an extension of less than one year.

In a Twitter Spaces event, he predicted that any deal would “rocket” through the Senate.Gaetz added that he sees ""no serious threat"" to McCarthy's speakership in the debt ceiling negotiations.

Reilly and Daniel BarnesWASHINGTON — A military veteran who stormed the U.S. Capitol with the Oath Keepers on Jan. 6 was sentenced to 8½ years in federal prison Friday after apologizing for her actions.Jessica Watkins told U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta that her actions were ""reprehensible,"" and apologized for the impact that her conduct had on the country.“My actions and my behaviors that fateful day were wrong, and as I now understand, criminal,” she said. “Violence is never the answer.”Watkins, recalling her testimony during her trial, said once again that she was “just another idiot"" running around the Capitol on Jan. 6, and apologized to the officers.“I was just another idiot running around the Capitol,"" she said. ""But idiots are held responsible, and today you’re going to hold this idiot responsible.""Oath Keepers founder sentenced to 18 years for Jan. 6 Capitol riotMay 26, 202302:15Watkins' sentence came the day after Mehta sentenced Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes to 18 years in federal prison and Florida Oath Keeper Kelly Meggs to 12 years. Another Oath Keepers defendant will be sentenced Friday afternoon and additional members of the far-right group will be sentenced next week.Mehta said that Watkins' behavior was not as bad as that of Rhodes or Meggs, but that it was still serious and that she also played a role in bringing others to Washington on Jan. 6.“Nobody would suggest you’re Stewart Rhodes, and frankly, I don’t think you’re Kelly Meggs,” the judge said. But she was more than just a foot soldier, he added.An image of Jessica Watkins is displayed along with her audio during a January 6th Committee hearing.Andrew Harnik / Pool / CNP / MediaPunch via Alamy fileMehta said that Watkins, who is trans, has a ""fairly compelling life story."" Assistant U.S. Attorney Alex Hughes said that the government does not dispute or minimize what Watkins went through personally, saying that she “has our sympathies, but she does not have an excuse.”Watkins complimented Mehta, saying he'd proven to be ""an impartial arbiter” and said she understood how the jury — which convicted her of obstruction of an official proceeding and aiding and abetting, but acquitted her on a charge of seditious conspiracy — came to its conclusion.She said she was “watching Infowars"" and Alex Jones and was ""hearing that Dominion servers were being invaded by the Chinese"" prior to the Jan. 6 attack. She said she still believes that the country needs to take a closer look at the 2020 election.Mehta said he gave Watkins credit for her apology and for being willing to plead, although she never reached an agreement with the government.Ryan J.

Photograph: Dmytro Fedoriv/EPAUkraineRussian attack on outpatient clinic in Dnipro kills two peopleVolodymyr Zelenskiy describes missile strike as a crime against humanity after 30 people are injuredJulian Borger in KyivFri 26 May 2023 15.40 BSTLast modified on Fri 26 May 2023 20.27 BSTA Russian missile strike on an outpatient clinic in the city of Dnipro has killed two people and injured 30, in what ​President Volodymyr Zelenskiy described as a crime against humanity.In the latest wave of aerial attacks on Ukraine, a salvo of air-launched missiles aimed at Kyiv were launched by Russian aircraft over the Caspian Sea early on Friday morning but they were all intercepted, according to the capital’s military administration, in what they said was the 13th attack on the city this month.Ukrainian air defence also claimed to have shot down 25 out of 31 Iranian-designed Shahed drones aimed at Kyiv.The missile that landed on the Dnipro clinic killed a 69-year-old passerby, according to the regional governor, Serhiy Lysak, who said another man’s body had been found in the rubble.Lysak said three of the injured people were in a serious condition.“Another missile attack, another crime against humanity as such,” Zelenskiy said on Twitter. “The buildings of a psychological clinic and a veterinary clinic in the city of Dnipro were destroyed.“Only an evil state can fight against clinics. There can be no military purpose in this. It is pure terror.”Mykhailo Podolyak, the presidential adviser, said Russia was doomed to lose the war, but the longer it continued, the higher the civilian toll. He said: “The latest strikes on Dnipro show the Russians are just trying to kill off as many people as they can, just because they can.”About 87 miles (140km) north of Dnipro, a Russian S-300 missile hit a dam in the Karlivka district, in Donetsk province, putting the population at risk of severe flooding.Ukrainian military spokesperson, Natalia Humeniuk, said Russia was using Shaheds and other drones to lure Ukrainian air defences into responding and revealing their position to be targeted later by missiles. “They try to attack in waves precisely to see where the defences are and where to hit next,” she told Ukrainian television.In Russia, local authorities said drones caused a blast on Friday that damaged a residential and an office building in the southern city of Krasnodar, just east of Crimea across the Kerch strait.Krasnodar’s governor, Veniamin Kondratyev, wrote on the Telegram messaging app: “There is some damage to buildings, but critical infrastructure was not damaged. And most importantly, there were no casualties.”Russian officials also claimed Ukraine had shelled border areas of the Belgorod province, the target of a raid this week by Ukrainian-based Russian rebel groups.The former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev said negotiations with Ukraine were impossible as long as Zelenskiy was in office.“This conflict will last for a very long time. For decades, probably. This is a new reality,” Medvedev, who is now deputy chair of the Russian security council, was quoted as saying by Russian news agencies. “Everything always ends in negotiations, and this is inevitable, but as long as these people are in power, the situation for Russia will not change in terms of negotiations.”Podolyak said that from Kyiv’s point of view talks with Moscow would be pointless. “Negotiating with Russia today would be like retreating when you are winning,” he said. “Loss of Ukraine would be a loss for democracy. Why would you let democracy lose? If Putin doesn’t lose and the Russian elites don’t change, then the war will explode with even greater force in a couple of years.”TopicsUkraineRussiaVolodymyr ZelenskiyEuropenewsReuse this contentMore on this storyMore on this storyRussia-Ukraine war live: two dead and 30 injured in Russian attack on Dnipro clinic – as it happened2h agoRussia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 457 of the invasion10h agoMeet Diia: the Ukrainian app used to do taxes … and report Russian soldiers9h agoRussian weapons manufacturers hosted at Saudi trade event9h agoUS imposes sanctions on leader of Wagner group in Mali23h agoRussia moving nuclear warheads to Belarus, says dictator Lukashenko1d agoKremlin critic Bill Browder says he was targeted by deepfake hoax video call1d ago‘We are Russians just like you’: anti-Putin militias enter the spotlight2d agoMost viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

While he was away he was shot three times – in his hand, chest and lower back – by snipers. He survived after being taken to a family member in another part of Khartoum.The family said Sholgami’s wife was left to fend for herself and it was impossible for them to reach her in an area surrounded by snipers. As a result she died of starvation.Sholgami’s granddaughter Azhaar, who grew up in Khartoum, said the embassy was a “maximum four steps away” from her grandparents’ home.She said: “What happened to my grandparents was a crime against humanity, not only by the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), not only by the [Sudanese army], but by the British embassy, because they were the only ones that could have prevented this from happening to my grandparents.”Sholgami managed to escape to Egypt, where he is receiving medical treatment after he was operated on without anaesthetic in Khartoum by his son, who is a doctor.03:43Why violence has broken out in Sudan – video explainerThe fighting started on 15 April after months of escalating tensions between the military, led by Gen Abdel-Fattah al-Burhan, and the Rapid Support Forces commanded by Gen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo.‘It’s very hard to talk about’: the civilian toll of fighting in Sudan Read moreA Foreign Office spokesperson said: “The final UK evacuation flight departed on 3 May, concluding the longest and largest evacuation of any western nation.

The ongoing military conflict means Sudan remains dangerous. Our ability to provide consular assistance is severely limited and we cannot provide in-person support within Sudan.“The UK is taking a leading role in the diplomatic efforts to secure peace in Sudan.

Hunt will back more rate rises even if they lead to recession
Households warned to brace for 5%-plus mortgage rates
Richard Partington and Rowena MasonFri 26 May 2023 18.41 BSTLast modified on Fri 26 May 2023 18.56 BSTRishi Sunak has been warned the UK economy could be in recession next year as stubbornly high inflation pushes interest rates to more than 5% before the next general election.Setting the stage for a further rise in borrowing costs on mortgages and loans for millions of households, economists predicted the Bank of England could be forced to drive Britain’s economy into a recession to tame inflation.At the end of a week of troubling economic developments, the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, was being roundly criticised for appearing to say he thought this was a price worth paying, despite the pain already caused to families by an unrelenting cost of living crisis.Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, said: “Almost nobody feels better off after 13 years of this government. I’m really worried about mortgages. People are struggling to pay the bills. Mortgages are a big part of that.”Jagjit Chadha, the director of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, said that if interest rates continue to rise, “we’re in danger of engineering a recession”.As financial markets drove up UK government borrowing costs to the highest level since Liz Truss’s ill-fated premiership, the prime minister’s ability to deliver on his promise to halve inflation this year, one of five central pledges of his premiership, came into question.Andrew Sentance, a former policymaker at the Bank of England, suggested Sunak’s promise was a “mistake” because it has been the central bank’s responsibility since it was handed independence by Gordon Brown in 1997.“I would say if you believe the Clinton mantra that ‘It’s the economy, stupid’ – which I think is quite correct for the UK, and if the opposition looks competent – then it’s going to be quite a sticky wicket for the government economically next year,” he said. “The public can’t sack the governor of the Bank, so they express their dissatisfaction with the government.”Official figures this week showed that the UK’s annual inflation rate fell by less than expected to 8.7% in April, with a steadying in energy prices largely offset by the soaring price of food.Financial markets are now betting that the Bank will drive up its key base rate to as high as 5.5% from the current level of 4.5% before the end of the year.Virgin Money became the latest big lender to increase its mortgage rates on Friday, with the cost of its fixed-rate deals edging higher. On Thursday, Britain’s biggest building society, Nationwide, hiked rates by up to 0.45 percentage points for those taking out a new mortgage.After Wednesday’s disappointing inflation figures caused turbulence in the money markets, financial data firm Moneyfacts said 38 mortgage products had been withdrawn, and experts warned borrowers to brace for 5%-plus fixed-rate deals.David Gauke, a former Conservative chief secretary to the Treasury, said the Conservatives’ best chance at the next election would come if living standards were improving and if interest rates were falling.“The economy has performed better than expected so far in 2023, but if this means that inflation is going to be sticky and the Bank still has to go further to combat inflation, the economic pain is going to be badly timed for the government.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It can be recession, it can be zero growth. This is not about abstract numbers; it’s about something that hits the poor particularly hard.”Treasury sources said they felt words had been put in the chancellor’s mouth that did not reflect his comments.“If you look at exactly what he’s saying, it’s that inflation is the greatest reason for economic instability and why growth is slowing across the world, and it is the true threat that could cause a recession. Inflation is the No 1 enemy and we need monetary and fiscal policy aligned to tackle inflation and prevent a recession,” the Treasury source said.The Liberal Democrat deputy leader, Daisy Cooper, said: “This would be a recession made in Downing Street. Rishi Sunak’s promise to grow the economy has been left in tatters. This government’s failure to cut inflation is sending mortgage rates spiralling as the Conservative economic chaos continues.“Rishi Sunak and Jeremy Hunt could have acted to reduce energy bills and keep food prices under control. Instead, they’ve sat on their hands while inflation goes through the roof.”Sunak had struck an optimistic note about the economy during his trip to the G7 in Japan last week, saying there were “lots of signs that things are moving in the right direction”.He pointed to the positivity of chief executives about investment in the UK and argued that real household disposable income was “hugely outperforming what people thought”. The opposition criticised his comments as being out of touch with people struggling with their budgets during a cost of living crisis.TopicsRecessionEconomic growth (GDP)Rishi SunakEconomic policyEconomicsUK cost of living crisisInflationnewsReuse this contentMore on this storyMore on this storyOfficials warned over accuracy after Jeremy Hunt tweet on public debt 4d agoThe UK has a PR plan masquerading as an industrial strategy14 May 2023UK’s growth last of G7 after economy shrinks by 0.3% in March12 May 2023Too early to sound the all-clear as impact of UK rate rises yet to be felt12 May 2023UK economy not ‘out of the woods’, says Barclays boss after bank’s record profit27 Apr 2023Britons splash out on holidays in boost for UK economy21 Apr 2023Monthly insolvencies in England and Wales hit three-year high18 Apr 2023Economic hit from public sector strikes worth it to tame UK inflation, says Hunt13 Apr 2023UK is worst performer in G7 for workforce participation since Covid13 Apr 2023Most viewedMost viewedBusinessEconomicsBankingMoneyMarketsProject SyndicateB2BRetailNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The kittens, just over three weeks old and known as P-113, P-114 and P-115, are healthy, the NPS said in a statement.“It’s encouraging to see reproduction in our small population of mountain lions, especially after all the mortalities we have documented in the last year,” said Jeff Sikich, the lead field biologist of the NPS mountain lion study, which since 2002 has looked at how the animals survive in a fragmented and urbanized environment.Fifteen mountain lions have died in the study area since march 2022, Sikich told the Los Angeles Times, the majority after being hit by vehicles. Among those killed last year was Los Angeles’s beloved P-22, once called the Brad Pitt of mountain lions, who for a decade famously roamed in urban city neighborhoods and underneath the Hollywood sign.Two female mountain lion kittens seen near a rock in Simi Hills in May 2023.

The father likely came from the Santa Susana mountains and has since returned, the NPS said.“It will be interesting to learn how these kittens will use the landscape once they get older and disperse, particularly if they decide to stay in the Simi Hills or cross freeways to enter larger natural areas,” said Sikich.National Park Service (NPS) biologists announced mountain lion P-77 recently gave birth to three female kittens.

The biologists also tagged each kitten, which will help identify them in the future.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to The Guardian Headlines USFree newsletterFor US readers, we offer a regional edition of our daily email, delivering the most important headlines every morningPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The last two adult males who researchers regularly tracked in the Simi Hills have both died, one in the December 2018 Woolsey Fire and another after being poached in July 2019, the NPS said in its statement.Highways pose a severe threat to mountain lions – 535 died on California highways between 2015 and 2022. Southern California hopes to alleviate this with an $87m wildlife crossing, under construction over a 10-lane stretch of the 101 freeway, that will connect two parts of the Santa Monica mountains, allowing creatures like the new litter of kittens to cross safely.TopicsCaliforniaWildlifeLos AngelesnewsReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedEnvironmentClimate crisisWildlifeEnergyPollutionNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

She said the force needed to respond to sexual offences reports more quickly and offer officers training on indecent exposure to prevent future scandals.“I think it’s completely unfair that this case has been put on me when there was a chance to stop Couzens so much earlier,” Lee said. “They’ve thrown me under the bus so the Met can say ‘we’ve done something now’ and they’ll move on.”Couzens, 50, was reported to police on 28 February 2021 after twice exposing himself to female staff at a drive-through McDonald’s in Kent. But there was a three-day delay in assigning Lee to the case because of the Met’s crime triaging process which assessed the offence as low-risk.Lee carried out a “sloppy” investigation when she visited the restaurant at midday on 3 March, nine hours before Couzens abducted Everard, 33, in Clapham, south-west London. The panel concluded she lied when she claimed she had been told there was no CCTV of Couzens’s car.Lee has become the first officer publicly taken to task over Couzens, who was first reported to Kent police for indecent exposure in June 2015. He escaped being identified as a sex offender despite police having the registration of a car he had allegedly used to flash a pedestrian, as well as his name and address.Lee said: “Everyone’s just coming down on me – ‘Oh, this is on you.’ But it’s not me that went to the McDonald’s four days later, that’s the triaging system that organises that. It’s not me that vetted Couzens and let him into the police in the first place when he’d already been known for [allegedly] committing that sort of offence.“Everyone’s dropping it down on me as a young female PC, and [not] all the top brass and men who are higher up who have put the rules in place for this to all happen as it did, regarding the appointments, and the actual policies and the processes.”Former Met PC barred from service for life over Wayne Couzens indecent exposure inquiryRead moreWhile under investigation for the failings, Lee set up an OnlyFans account called Officer Naughty and quit the force. She now earns up to £7,000 a month posting pornographic videos and images on the site.Lee maintains that she did not lie or know she was in charge of the case until after Couzens’s arrest for murder.She said the force needed to streamline its systems for tracking cases, introduce computer checks to find out if a suspect was a police officer, and change the way it triaged 999 calls. “I don’t think an appointment should be made for sexual offences because as we all know, generally, sexual offences escalate,” she said. “This could have all been avoided I think if someone had been sent out that day on the 28th when the call was originally made.”She said she had never received training on indecent exposure and had only responded to three cases in five years of frontline policing. “I think they should hire more police and put more time into training sexual offences, definitely, because I’ve had no input ever on how to deal with indecent exposure,” she said.She said her lack of training meant she did not realise the importance of Couzens’s meal receipts and written statements from the McDonald’s witnesses, which she did not log. Lee described this failure as a “genuine mistake”, saying: “I wish that I had done a better job.”But Lee said she did not feel guilty because even if she had conducted a more thorough investigation there would not have been grounds to arrest Couzens immediately. “I’ve gone over it so many times in my head, I can assure you, and there’s nothing that I could have done that would have changed the horrendous outcome,” she said.“I do feel like Sarah was let down by the police massively because Couzens should never have been in a position where he was able to use who he was to do what he did. And I think what Sarah’s family has gone through is absolutely awful and I would not wish that on anybody.”Lee grew up in Bromley, south-east London, and was educated at home after primary school and obtained no GCSEs. She joined the Met as a constable in April 2016 after undertaking a Certificate in Knowledge of Policing.In July 2020 she transferred to an emergency response team in Bromley where Couzens had been based until February that year. Lee said had the case been allocated to a different officer they might have known him.In fact, a chief superintendent who gave evidence at Lee’s tribunal had conducted Couzens’s exit interview in January 2020. Lee said the officer’s statement – which was not read at her tribunal – included what she described as a “bizarre” almost “character reference” for Couzens.She claimed the officer described the interview in which Couzens spoke about wanting to transfer to a firearms unit, saying: “He did not come across to me as weird or a gun nut but was interesting, keen and engaged. I generally had good instincts around people and he seemed like an amiable, interesting individual.”Lee said: “I’m one of the only people that didn’t know who he was, and I’m the one that’s been stuck on for it.”The Met’s deputy assistant commissioner Stuart Cundy said: “The purpose of the gross misconduct hearing was not to decide whether Wayne Couzens’s future offending could have been prevented … Fundamentally, I am sorry that Couzens was not arrested before he went on to murder Sarah Everard and we continue to think of her loved ones.”TopicsMetropolitan policeWayne CouzensSarah EverardLondonPolicenewsReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedUKUK politicsEducationMediaSocietyLawScotlandWalesNorthern IrelandNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

They included eight schoolchildren from Jeju, according to the island’s education office.The plane was a few minutes from landing when a male passenger sitting next to an emergency door opened a cover and pulled a lever so the door opened about 200 metres (656ft) above ground, an Asiana spokesperson said.A video clip taken by a passenger captured the moment the wind ripped through rows of passengers – who had already fastened their seatbelts to prepare for landing – with the gap in the side of the fuselage clearly visible. The footage showed passengers’ hair flapping wildly as some shouted out in fear.In another clip, two male passengers sitting in the emergency exit row next to the open door are seen wincing as the wind whips around them while they clutch the armrests and try to turn away from the door.The passengers included 48 primary and middle school children who were on their way to a weekend sporting event. The mother of one of the pupils told the Yonhap news agency: “The children were shaking, crying and frightened. Those sitting near the exit must have been shocked the most.”Authorities were questioning a 33-year-old passenger who had been seated near an emergency exit row, Asiana officials said. One official said: “Police are investigating the incident after a passenger who was sitting near the emergency exit said he touched its lever.”Yonhap said flight attendants were unable to prevent the suspect from opening the door because they were already seated for landing. The man, who was travelling alone, did not appear to have been intoxicated and had so far refused to answer investigators’ questions, it added.“It is difficult to have a normal conversation with him,” Yonhap quoted an official as saying. “We will investigate the motive of the crime and punish him.”TopicsSouth KoreaAir transportAsia PacificnewsReuse this contentMore on this storyMore on this storyGucci show reaffirms Seoul’s status as capital of pop culture16 May 2023Japanese PM expresses sympathy with Korean victims of colonial rule7 May 2023Zebra captured after three hours on the run in Seoul23 Mar 2023South Korea U-turns on 69-hour working week after youth backlash15 Mar 2023K-pop star Jin of BTS starts his military service in South Korea13 Dec 2022All South Koreans to become younger as traditional age system scrapped9 Dec 2022South Korea scrambles jets after Chinese and Russian warplanes enter air defence zone30 Nov 2022Two South Korean miners rescued after surviving for days on coffee powder5 Nov 2022Most viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

UK politics live – latest updates
Peter Walker and Pippa CrerarFri 26 May 2023 14.46 BSTLast modified on Fri 26 May 2023 16.48 BSTRishi Sunak used a helicopter to travel to his Yorkshire constituency on Thursday, with a stopoff to visit a billionaire family who live only two miles from a large airport.Flight records show the prime minister took off from a private heliport near parliament in London on Thursday afternoon, landing about an hour later, very close to Manchester airport.The trip will raise more questions about Sunak’s repeated use of helicopters for relatively short trips, especially one where the first stop was an eight-minute drive from the airport.Local people said Sunak’s helicopter landed in the back garden of Bobby Arora, one of three brothers who own the B&M chain of stores, in Hale Barns, Altrincham. Arora lives next door to his brother Simon, the company’s former chief executive who has previously donated £50,000 to the Conservatives.The brothers bought B&M in 2004 when it had 21 outlets. It now has more than 700. While it is listed on the London Stock Exchange, its holding company is based in the low-tax centre of Luxembourg.After just under two hours in Hale Barns, Sunak’s helicopter made the 30-minute flight to Bagby in the prime minister’s North Yorkshire constituency, where the chartered craft is based.Downing Street confirmed the trip, saying Sunak needed to make the most efficient use of his time. As this was a visit related to the Conservative party rather than in his role as prime minister, the cost of the trip would not be met by the taxpayer. It is not known who paid.Earlier this month, Sunak used a helicopter for an official visit to Southampton, to announce a plan connected to pharmacies. If done by train, the 160-mile round trip would have taken about one hour 15 minutes each way and cost as little as £30 for a return fare.In February, Sunak flew to London from Dorset by helicopter and returned to the south-west of England by plane later the next morning. Sunak had been at Lulworth military base in Dorset and then visited a family hub in St Austell, Cornwall. But rather than stay overnight and travel 140 miles between the engagements, Sunak flew to and then from London, a round trip of nearly 400 miles.The prime minister has previously used private helicopters to travel from London to his constituency, costing about £16,000.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterArchie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morningPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A spokesperson said: “On Friday 26 May, officers arrested an 18-year-old man on suspicion of breach of a criminal behaviour order. He has been taken into custody. Inquiries are ongoing.”O’Garro gained notoriety after widely shared social media footage showed him walking into someone’s home without permission, filmed as part of an online trend for entering strangers’ homes. In other videos he was seen allegedly entering a man’s car claiming it was his Uber, and pestering train passengers.On Wednesday, the judge, Charlotte Crangle, issued the Hackney-based teenager with an order not to post videos on to social media without the consent of the people featured. He was also told he must not trespass on private property and must not attend the Westfield Centre in Stratford, east London. O’Garro was also ordered to pay a total of £365.Varinder Hayre, prosecuting, told the court O’Garro had breached a community protection notice, which included the condition that he not trespass on private property, on 15 May this year.“He went to the home address of the victim,” she said. “The door of the property was open. Mr O’Garro walked into the property and immediately walked down the stairs. He was stopped by the home owner.“He went into the living room. He sat down on the sofa and said: ‘Is this where the study group is?’”In mitigation, Lee Sergent, said O’Garro was raised by a single parent and had had a difficult upbringing. The teenager had apologised to the family, he added.“He is an intelligent young man and a young man with some potential,” he said.After the fine was issued he appeared on Piers Morgan Uncensored on TalkTV, where the presenter asked him why he was “terrorising” people in his neighbourhood.The teenager replied: “I wouldn’t call it terrorising, I would more call it having fun […] But let me get this out of the way first, I apologise. You see this situation that blew up on the internet, like walking into random houses, the next day I apologised because I felt bad.”TopicsEnglandnewsReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedUKUK politicsEducationMediaSocietyLawScotlandWalesNorthern IrelandNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Photograph: Peter Dazeley/Getty ImagesE-cigarettesMinisters urged to ban single-use vapes amid rising popularity with UK childrenAs many as 15% of 11- to 15-year-olds use vapes, experts suggest, with products often packaged in bright coloursPeter Walker Deputy political editor@peterwalker99Fri 26 May 2023 18.07 BSTLast modified on Fri 26 May 2023 20.42 BSTMinisters are facing mounting pressure to impose an outright ban on single-use vapes, amid concern about their rising popularity among children and wider worries that officials have minimal grip over a fast-moving sector.While it is illegal to sell e-cigarettes to under-18s, some experts suggest as many as 15% of 11- to 15-year-olds use vapes, with Rishi Sunak saying this week he was worried that his daughters could be “seduced” by a heavily flavoured product often packaged in bright colours.A government call for evidence on vaping and young people in England is due to end on 6 June, with action expected on measures to clamp down on illegal vape sales, as well as the marketing and placement of relatively cheap single-use vapes, the popularity of which has soared with younger people.One government official said the latter was a particular worry. They said: “Some of the marketing and branding is pretty appalling – it can look like a sweet shop.”Some health groups have wider concerns about the approach of the government, set out by the junior health minister Neil O’Brien in a speech last month, to encourage vape use as a substitute for traditional tobacco products, with a planned “swap to stop” scheme offering a million smokers in England a free vaping starter kit.They argue that the relatively short history of e-cigarettes means there is minimal knowledge about long-term health effects, and that evidence about their efficacy as methods to stop smoking is similarly limited, pointing to countries such as Australia, which permit them only on prescription.I tried to properly recycle a disposable vape. It did not go well | Emma SnaithRead moreThe most immediate battle is likely to be fought over single-use vapes, now the chosen product for more than half of young people who use e-cigarettes.It is understood that a series of health groups have submitted evidence to the government review calling for them to be completely banned, as have environmental organisations alarmed at the disposal of more than a million devices a week, all containing single-use plastic, nicotine and batteries, including lithium.The Liberal Democrats are calling for a ban on single-use vapes, although Labour has thus far demanded only restrictions on marketing that makes them appealing to children.Speaking to ITV’s This Morning on Thursday, Sunak said: “How can we strengthen the rules on how they are marketed, promoted – what do they look like? It looks like they are targeted at kids, which is ridiculous – I don’t want my kids seduced by any of these things.”While the latest NHS statistics for e-cigarette use among children showed 9% of those aged 11 to 15 used them, the Royal College of Paediatricians and Child Health has said it could be as high as 15%. There is research showing that young people who vape are three times more likely to subsequently smoke than those who do not.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterArchie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morningPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Laboratory tests on vapes gathered from a secondary school in Kidderminster found many contained high levels of lead, nickel and chromium.Daisy Cooper said ministers seemed completely uninterested in the threat to children from vapes. The Lib Dems’ health spokesperson said: “We need tougher regulation on vapes, such as age warnings on packets, an end to toy-like advertising targeted at children, and a ban on the sale of single-use vapes and free samples. The government should be doing all it can to reduce easy access to vaping for children now.”In his speech introducing the call for evidence, O’Brien called vaping “effectively a double-edged sword”, saying that while there was a risk of children developing an addiction to nicotine, vaping was “substantially less harmful than smoking” and worked well to help people quit smoking, especially with extra support.A spokesperson for the UK Vaping Industry Association said it wanted more government action to stop children buying vapes, but it opposed a ban on single-use devices. “There are far more effective ways to deal with the challenges surrounding youth access which do not involve banning any vaping category, a move that would drive smoking rates back up and lead to more deaths and costs to society,” they said.A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “It’s already illegal to sell vapes to children and we are exploring further ways to tackle youth vaping through our newly launched call for evidence. We also recently announced a new illicit vapes enforcement squad – backed by £3m – to remove illegal products from shelves and stop them from crossing our borders.”TopicsE-cigarettesSmokingChildrennewsReuse this contentMore on this storyMore on this storyI tried to properly recycle a disposable vape.

Names on the list included Anne Frank, the Jewish teenager killed in a Nazi concentration camp, as well as that of Shireen Abu Akleh, the Palestinian-American journalist who is believed to have been shot dead by an Israeli sniper in May 2022.Danny Danon, Israel’s ambassador to the UN, wrote on Twitter that Waters had compared the Holocaust victim Frank to “a journalist shot in an active combat zone”, adding: “Waters seeks to compare Israel to the Nazis.”Berlin police will continue to gather evidence for approximately three months and then hand over their findings to the state prosecutor, who will assess whether Waters’s act can be considered as incitement to hatred.Waters is due to play a concert in Frankfurt on Sunday that city magistrates had tried to cancel, accusing him of being “one of the most widely known antisemites in the world”. Waters, who has always denied accusations of antisemitism, took legal action against the decision. Frankfurt’s administrative court last month declared the singer’s right to go ahead with the event, while acknowledging that aspects of his show were “tasteless”. The Guardian has contacted Waters for a response.TopicsPink FloydRoger WatersGermanyEuropenewsReuse this contentMore on this storyMore on this storyComfortably strum: David Gilmour's Black Strat goes on display27 Mar 2019It shouldn’t take Pink Floyd to rescue Isis fighters’ abandoned children30 Jan 2019David Gilmour, a veteran still in the pink – archive, 19784 Jul 2018Roger Waters review – raging at the dark side of the Earth4 Jul 2018Interstellar overdrive: Pink Floyd take Spandau Ballet on a psychedelic trip20 Sept 2018Pink Floyd exhibition set to become V&A's most visited music show30 Aug 2017Most viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Russia-Ukraine war – latest news updates
David Pegg, Manisha Ganguly and Stephanie KirchgaessnerFri 26 May 2023 12.00 BSTLast modified on Fri 26 May 2023 13.57 BSTSeven sanctioned Russian companies, including a manufacturer of military helicopters deployed in the war in Ukraine, are visiting Saudi Arabia next week as part of a trade mission to increase business with the Gulf state.Companies including weapons manufacturers with direct links to the Russian military, state corporations involved in the invasion of Ukraine, and the agency overseeing a Ukrainian nuclear plant in the country seized by the Russian military last year, are set to attend.Saudi Arabia’s willingness to develop business ties with Russian companies sanctioned by western states for their role in the invasion of Ukraine is likely to cause further tensions in its already strained relationship with Washington.The Russian deputy industry and trade minister, Alexey Gruzdev, praised the trade event as the first of its kind. “Our business mission to Riyadh is aimed to strengthen the economic ties between Russia and Saudi Arabia, discover new business opportunities, exchange ideas and establish long-term partnership,” he said.Companies integral to the Russian military industrial sector are listed as attendees at the event in Riyadh on Monday. They include Russian Helicopters, the manufacturer of the Ka-52 Alligator helicopter. At least 35 Ka-52s have been shot down by Ukrainian forces or abandoned by Russia, according to the Dutch open-source outlet Oryx.Kamaz, an armoured vehicle manufacturer sanctioned for its role in aiding Russia’s war effort, is also listed as attending. Its trucks were spotted in Belarus in March 2022 carrying Iskander missiles that were allegedly launched in the early days of the invasion, and its Typhoon vehicles have also been reported transporting Russian soldiers across Ukrainian territory.Perhaps the most significant participant in the meetings with the Saudis is Rostec, a Russian state-owned defence systems and technology corporation that has supplied weapons used during the invasion of Ukraine. These included the Solntsepyok heavy flamethrower systems, the Zemledeliye remote mine-laying vehicles and various launch rocket systems.Do you have information about this story? Email investigations@theguardian.com, or use Signal or WhatsApp to message (UK) +44 7584 640566 or (US) +1 646 886 8761.The US Treasury described Rostec as “the cornerstone of Russia’s defence, industrial, technology, and manufacturing sectors” in a sanctions notice published in June.Also listed as attending is Rosatom, Russia’s state nuclear energy company. According to Ukrainian officials and reports, Rosatom facilitated the Russian military’s seizure of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant last year, and has since taken over managing the facility. Rosatom denies the claims.A source familiar with the objectives of the Saudi trade event said Russian delegates were seeking to secure joint investment for business projects, assistance sustaining oil and gas prices and other diplomatic support.The source, who asked not to be named, said the Saudi investment ministry was exploring the possibility of opening an office in Moscow, and that a similar trade forum with Chinese businesses had also been held recently, although those businesses did not involve firms with connections to the Chinese military.“What is different here, and these recent business events are just one sign of it, is a major reorientation of Saudi policy towards Russia and China, and away from the USA and west Europe,” the source said.Saudi’s relationship with Moscow has created tensions in Washington. Last year, the kingdom sided with Russia over US interests when it decided to cut oil production shortly before the US midterm elections, prompting Joe Biden to threaten that the kingdom would face “consequences”.Asked about the planned Saudi-Russian trade meeting, a state department spokesperson said the US would continue to focus on “ensuring that our sanctions and export controls are properly enforced”.“We encourage countries and business to do their due diligence and refrain from conducting transactions with sanctioned persons, to avoid exposure to sanctions,” the spokesperson said. The US Treasury did not respond to a request for comment.The White House has backed off on its threats against Riyadh since last year. But anger towards the government of Mohammed bin Salman is still rife among Democrats and various Republicans on Capitol Hill, including some who have said they are concerned that Saudi Arabia could share sensitive US defence technology with its Russian allies.Ro Khanna, a Democratic congressman and longtime Saudi critic, said: “Saudi Arabia’s support for Russia in addition to its history of human rights violations should spark a serious review of the US-Saudi relationship.”Next week’s trade gathering could also frustrate the UK government, taking place shortly after a British trade mission aimed at securing an investment deal between the UK and the Gulf Cooperation Council, of which Saudi Arabia is a member.Seated next to the UK business secretary, Kemi Badenoch, at the Qatar Economic Forum this week, the Saudi investment minister, Khalid Al-Falih, declared Riyadh “the political capital of the Middle East”. Falih’s deputy is listed as a speaker of the Russian trade gathering next week.Saudi Arabia’s attempts to situate itself geopolitically as a partner to several leading powers – essentially playing all sides – was evident at a conference in California earlier this month, when Falih told business and political figures that Riyadh had no intention of being constrained by pre-existing relationships.He said: “We don’t feel that our relationship with the US is going to be at the expense of our ability to have relationships with other strong economic and political friends and partners around the world. This goes back to a multi-polar world where emerging middle powers … are going to be seeking their own interests.”Visibly irritated when asked about tensions between Washington and Riyadh, Falih observed that Saudi trade with China already exceeded that with the US and the EU combined. He said: “Do you expect us to put that at risk, just so that a certain country would feel that we’re on their side?”TopicsSaudi ArabiaWeapons technologyRussiaUkraineMiddle East and north AfricaEuropeArms tradenewsReuse this contentMore on this storyMore on this storyLiveRussia-Ukraine war live: two people dead and 30 injured in Russian attack on Dnipro clinic1h agoRussia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 457 of the invasion9h agoRussian attack on outpatient clinic in Dnipro kills two people5h agoMeet Diia: the Ukrainian app used to do taxes … and report Russian soldiers8h agoUS imposes sanctions on leader of Wagner group in Mali22h agoRussia moving nuclear warheads to Belarus, says dictator Lukashenko1d agoKremlin critic Bill Browder says he was targeted by deepfake hoax video call1d ago‘We are Russians just like you’: anti-Putin militias enter the spotlight2d agoMost viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Now, the team is working to make it an open-source tool that Ukraine can give to other countries to build a digital public infrastructure.Within eight hours of launching in September 2019, the app, called Diia, meaning “action”, had 2 million users.Its peacetime services include official tasks, such as registering a birth or marriage, or renewing a passport, but after Russia invaded, use of the app rocketed as it was commandeered for the wartime effort.“After hostilities broke out we thought: what did the citizens of Ukraine need? They needed money, protection, compensation when rockets hit their house,” Federov said. Now, for example, the app allows victims of Russian bombings to apply for funds to repair damaged buildings and to continue to listen to the radio during blackouts.It also permits the creation of a digital “evacuation document” combining all personal information in one place to “accelerate identification at checkpoints”; “e-aid” financial support for small businesses “to keep the economy going”; state-backed mortgages for military and key workers, and “e-enemy” – a chatbot to report the location of Russian troops.The Ukrainian app Diia that allows citizens to pay taxes, report enemy troops or renew their passport and 117 other things from their phone. Mykhailo Federov the deputy prime minister told how they approached the app like a “start up” but without the profit motive pic.twitter.com/tRwmt71dl3— Lisa O'Carroll (@lisaocarroll) May 25, 2023Dragos Tudorache, a Romanian MEP and co-rapporteur on the European parliament committee assessing the Artificial Intelligence Act, said: “It is truly remarkable how Ukraine has managed to make significant strides in this digital transition, a transition that has yet to be achieved by some, even in times of peace.”With politicians worldwide often held in low regard, Federov told how they set about building trust in the app by putting people first, making the app “human-centred”.The swift take-up of the government app is almost certainly fuelled by the support for the war and trust in President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s approach, and is unlikely to be mirrored in other countries, such as the UK, where trust in government departments may be in shorter supply.The app is now installed on 19m devices, 70% of all smartphones, and has become a model for governments all around the world trying to digitise services.Right to left: Ukrainian deputy prime minister, Mykhailo Federov, MEP Dragos Tudorache and executive vice-president of the European Commission Margrethe Verstager.

It is not about circles of hell, wasting people’s time.“We acted more like a start-up, not like a public sector company,” Federov told MEPs, encouraging an “an agile management culture” headed by only 25 developers.“We looked at Uber, Airbnb, Booking.com, mobile banking. You can speak about digital education but look how elderly people are getting used to technology. They might say they don’t want to deal with their bank online but they are very quick to use WhatsApp to send a funny postcard to their grandchildren,” he said.Maksym Svysenko, 22, a Ukrainian law and tech student visiting Brussels, said he had used it from the start, as had his parents and grandparents.“To me it represents freedom to do things, and freedom to continue to do everything since the invasion,” he said. “It allowed so many people to cross the border. If you go abroad and you don’t have or you have lost your passport you can just go to the embassy and show them Diia. You don’t have to figure out how to prove who you say you are.”Svysenko said he also used it on local bus services to prove he qualified for a free fare and enjoyed the monthy government surveys, including a recent poll asking the public how streets named after Russians should be renamed.Asked whether he had any privacy concerns, he said: “The main thing that makes Diaa so successful is the good relations between government and citizens.”TopicsUkraineAppsEuropenewsReuse this contentMore on this storyMore on this storyRussia-Ukraine war live: two dead and 30 injured in Russian attack on Dnipro clinic – as it happened2h agoRussia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 457 of the invasion10h agoRussian attack on outpatient clinic in Dnipro kills two people5h agoRussian weapons manufacturers hosted at Saudi trade event9h agoUS imposes sanctions on leader of Wagner group in Mali23h agoRussia moving nuclear warheads to Belarus, says dictator Lukashenko1d agoKremlin critic Bill Browder says he was targeted by deepfake hoax video call1d ago‘We are Russians just like you’: anti-Putin militias enter the spotlight2d agoMost viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Volodymyr Zelenskiy announced that one person has been killed and 15 injured in a Russian attack Friday on a medical facility in the city of Dnipro. In his message, Ukraine’s president said “Russian terrorists once again confirm their status of fighters against everything humane and honest”. The injured included two children aged three and six who have been hospitalised. Ukraine’s ombudsmen says that another four people are considered missing.
Ukraine claims to have shot down 10 missiles and 25 drones launched by Russia in overnight attacks on the capital Kyiv, the city of Dnipro and eastern regions, Ukrainian officials said on Friday. The Ukrainian air force said it had shot down 10 missiles fired from the Caspian Sea, and 23 Iranian-made Shahed drones and two reconnaissance drones. It said a total of 17 missiles and 31 drones had been launched during the attacks, which started at about 10pm local time on Thursday and continued until 5am on Friday. Several drones and several missiles hit targets in the Kharkiv and Dnipropetrovsk regions, officials said. There was no immediate word of any deaths.
Denis Pushilin, the Russian-imposed leader of the occupied Donetsk region, has said the city of Donetsk has come under fire from Ukrainian forces. As a result, he said, a young woman died and another was injured.
Ukraine struck two regions in southern Russia with a rocket and a drone, though the missile was shot down by air defences, according to Russian officials and media reports. In the southern Russian city of Krasnodar, a blast damaged a residential and office building, officials said. In the neighbouring Rostov region, the local governor said a Ukrainian missile had been shot down by air defences on Thursday near Morozovsk, where there is a Russian airbase.
Russia’s deputy security council chair, Dmitry Medvedev, said on Friday that negotiations with Ukraine were “impossible” as long as Zelenskiy was in power. Ukraine has previously ruled out negotiating with Russia while Vladimir Putin remained in power.
China hopes the Black Sea grain initiative deal can be implemented in a balanced and comprehensive manner, and wants to cooperate on global food security, foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said on Friday.
Japan will place additional sanctions on Russia after the Group of Seven (G7) summit the country hosted last week agreed to step up measures to punish Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, the chief cabinet secretary, Hirokazu Matsuno, said on Friday.
Russia has moved ahead with a plan to deploy tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus. Alexander Lukashenko, the Belarusian president, claimed on Thursday that the relocation of some of the weapons from Russia to Belarus had already started, according to reports.
Dutch prosecutors have seized a plot of land near Amsterdam that belongs to Vladimir Putin’s former son-in-law, a joint investigation by the Guardian and two other media organisations revealed. The plot of land in Duivendrecht is owned by Jorrit Faassen, a Dutch businessman who was married to Maria Vorontsova, the Russian president’s elder daughter.
Britain is likely to keep Russian state assets immobilised for some time after the war in Ukraine ends, and certainly until Moscow has agreed to pay compensation for the damage it has inflicted, British officials have confirmed. The Council of Europe summit last week established a digital register of damage for Ukraine as the first step towards an international compensation mechanism for victims of Russian aggression.
Unverified footage appears to show a drone speedboat attack on the Russian naval vessel the Ivan Khurs in the Black Sea on Wednesday. The video appears to show at least one of the drones getting extremely close to the ship, though it remains unclear whether or not any damage was done.
Ukraine secured the release of 106 captured soldiers in a prisoner exchange with Russia on Thursday, according to Zelenskiy’s chief of staff. The soldiers, including eight officers, were reportedly said to have been captured fighting in Bakhmut.

In February and March last year, Hamela and his friend, cameraman Piotr Grawender, made dozens of return trips to Ukraine, liaising with volunteer groups and ferrying the evacuees into Poland. They told him their stories; he put them on film.In the Rearview, which screens in the Acid sidebar at the Cannes film festival, is a gripping social document, a no-frills portrait of human migration that confines the bulk of the action to the back of the van. It shows us the people and eavesdrops on their chatter. We hear from the elderly farmer’s wife who’s pining for her favourite cow and the middle-aged woman who carries a photo of her grandfather holding a butterfly. “I come from an aristocratic family,” she says sadly. “Now I am just a travelling frog.”Hamela says his principal aim was to get his passengers out safely. The idea for the film only came later and needed to be handled with care. People were made aware of the camera when boarding the vehicle, but weren’t handed consent forms until they’d arrived in Poland. It was crucial, he explains, to never give the impression that appearing in the film was somehow a condition of passage.‘They had no idea what people outside Ukraine and Russia were thinking’ … In the Rearview. Photograph: Courtesy: ACID CannesOnly one woman said no. Everyone else signed the form. “They were happy to share their testimonies with the world. Because they had no idea what people outside Ukraine and Russia were thinking. That was their first motivation – they wanted their accounts to be heard. But there was a second motivation that I didn’t expect at the beginning, and it was that people wanted to give back to me personally. I had brought them out and they didn’t know how to pay me back.”Hamela’s initial intention was to fold his missions in with a wider documentary on the war. But he was inspired by Abbas Kiarostami’s Ten, the tale of a taxi-driver’s trips through Tehran, and decided to keep the focus as tight as possible – to let the people tell the story and use the van’s interior as a kind of travelling theatre, or a confession box.The route leads through deserted towns, past charred tanks and derelict petrol stations. Several bridges have been bombed; the van is constantly having to find alternative paths to the west. Along the way we encounter Gloria, a Congolese businesswoman who has been shot in the stomach and leg and requires emergency care. We are introduced to five-year-old Sofika, who clutches a folded piece of paper that bears her parents’ names and numbers. The van crosses the Dnieper River; the children mistake it for the sea. They say: “This summer we’ll come back here and jump in the water.”Some of the passengers are obviously traumatised. Others get by on a diet of gallows humour. One woman recounts the tale of a terrified teenage refugee who was stopped at a checkpoint and forced to join the Russian army. The kid was shaking so hard he could barely put the uniform on. “It may sound funny now,” she says, “but we were crying then.”Hamela remains deeply involved in the evacuation effort and plans to tour the film to raise funds. This week, though, he’s in Cannes, amid the stars and the yachts and the luxury beachfront hotels. That comes with the territory; it’s the classic festival paradox. Cannes provides a big stage to rail against social injustice and human rights violations. But the stage is erected in a sunny oligarchs’ playground.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Film WeeklyFree newsletterTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And you negotiate well if you have certain lines you won’t cross. So I’m definitely not going to step aboard any yacht. And I’m not going to step on the red carpet either.” Instead, he has brought his own, salvaged from a ruined house in Ukraine and itself slightly tattered. The owner, he adds, eventually wants it back.What became of the passengers once they climbed out of the van? Most he’s kept tabs on; a few have disappeared. Hamela tells me that Gloria, the injured Congolese businesswoman, is currently recovering in Berlin. She has undergone 18 operations and still has three to go. Sofika, the girl with the folded sheet of paper, lives with her family in a Warsaw refugee centre. As for Larisa, the one-time aristocrat, she flew to Spain to make a fresh start, only to decide she didn’t like it there after all. She’s now based in France and took the train to see him. “The travelling frog,” says Hamela. “She’s here with me in Cannes.”TopicsCannes 2023Documentary filmsUkraineEuropeCannes film festivalFestivalsinterviewsReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Photograph: Metin Yoksu/APTurkey‘He works hard’: Voters in Turkey’s quake zone backing Erdoğan in runoff Despite criticism of his response to February’s earthquakes, Erdoğan is increasingly popular in the rural provinces most affectedRuth Michaelson and Deniz Barış Narlı in KahramanmaraşFri 26 May 2023 17.10 BSTLast modified on Fri 26 May 2023 18.00 BSTMounds of rubble still block sidestreets in the centre of Kahramanmaraş, three months after two deadly earthquakes destroyed large sections of the town and killed 50,000 people across south-east Turkey. Trucks remove mammoth tangles of metal cables that once supported the shops and restaurants that lined the streets, while workers pick shards of glass out of the destroyed interior of the town’s much-loved ice-cream shop.Some of the towering piles of rubble that dwarfed buildings months ago have been cleared but many buildings remain, bearing jagged cracks in their empty facades. The main signs of change are cabins lining the destroyed streets to temporarily shelter local businesses – along with a few billboards indicating that an election is under way.An 18-year-old who gave his name only as Can wore a white cap bearing the signature of President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan as he worked to clear a pile of rubble. “He works hard for his country,” he said, explaining why he plans to back Erdoğan in Sunday’s runoff round of the presidential election, a vote with far-reaching consequences for Turkey and its neighbours, as well as relations with allies from Europe to Moscow.Turkey’s presidential elections offers voters a chance to end Erdoğan’s two decades in power, where he oversaw sweeping reforms and a construction boom as well as a growing financial crisis and a crackdown on his opponents. But what initially appeared to be a referendum on his rule has come to represent a missed opportunity for Turkey’s opposition in the first round, leaving Erdoğan’s rival Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu trailing in the vote and searching for a path to victory in the runoff.Nowhere was Erdoğan’s unexpected success more glaring than in the areas hit by February’s devastating earthquakes, where he won a comfortable majority in seven of the 11 affected provinces. The results upended expectations that public outrage about the government’s delayed emergency response, as well as widespread corruption in the construction sector that flourished during Erdoğan’s rule, could prompt a radical shift in the electorate even among conservative voters in Kahramanmaraş.In the event, the outrage did little to dent the president’s image, and he won with 72 % of the vote in Kahramanmaraş, a region that encompasses both centres of the initial quakes and some of the worst destruction. While Erdoğan lost only 2% compared with the last election in 2018, the results of the parliamentary vote in Kahramanmaraş show how he himself is increasingly more popular than his Justice and Development party (AKP), which lost over 11% of votes since the last ballot. Many voters attributed problems in government, including the earthquake response, to the AKP but not Erdoğan.Kılıçdaroğlu pulled ahead with a slim margin in Turkey’s largest cities, where inflation and a biting economic crisis are most keenly felt. But his message of change failed to touch many of the rural provinces like Kahramanmaraş, where voters said they were unconvinced, pointing instead to Erdoğan’s record of revamping public services, overseeing advances in the country’s defence industry and developing infrastructure like roads and airports, sidestepping the relationship between corruption in the construction sector and destruction in the earthquake zone.“If there’s a price to pay, this is a burden we share for the sake of the economy,” said Hikmet Bülbül, as he watched over racks of dresses and coats in his shop. Bülbül said he’d noticed rising prices but didn’t attribute them to Erdoğan’s policies.“Yes, maybe Erdoğan should go, but only if whoever takes his place would deliver the same services,” he said.Other residents complained about the rubble, despite Erdoğan promising to rebuild every destroyed home within a year of the quakes, and telling Kahramanmaraş that debris “had been removed” during a recent campaign stop in the town.“I thought no one in Kahramanmaraş should vote at all in a show of criticism,” said Fatma. “I can’t say nothing has been done, but it’s been very slow.”Voters in quake-hit Kahramanmaraş voiced concerns about what an opposition win might bring. Photograph: Metin Yoksu/APVoters voiced concerns about what an opposition win might bring. They feared that Kılıçdaroğlu’s coalition is fragile and that the 74-year-old former accountant is a risky choice, ill-suited to the task of running a country reshaped by Erdoğan’s two-decade rule. Many said they didn’t trust the opposition to solve their problems including reconstruction after the earthquakes, preferring to trust in Erdoğan’s promises.On the outskirts of the town, construction of new homes for those displaced by the quakes continued apace, after state contractors broke ground on multiple sites across the province just weeks after the disaster. Erdoğan tours the site of destroyed buildings during his visit to Kahramanmaraş two days after the earthquake. Photograph: Adem Altan/AFP/Getty ImagesSome voters, including 20-year-old first-time voter Melike Özbulut, also feared that an opposition win would mean a return to the enforced secularism that prevailed in the years before Erdoğan came to power.“I was born in 2000, I didn’t see the 1990s but my parents told me what it was like. Voting for Kılıçdaroğlu means I could be in the same place as women like me were back then, and I don’t want to put myself in that position,” she said, smiling. “That’s why I won’t vote for him.”Kılıçdaroğlu’s coalition includes religious parties and breakaway groups from the AKP, intended to make socially conservative and religious voters feel safe opting for the opposition. Yet they featured little in the opposition’s campaign, and the intended message of safety was lost on voters like Özbulut.“As you can see, I’m wearing a headscarf but my sister is not …which shows there is freedom in this country,” she said. “I’m voting for Erdoğan.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up to This is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pivotal stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Ustamazman family lost 33 of their relatives during the earthquakes.Ustamazman said he had intended to vote for the six-party opposition coalition until he saw their public spat over Kılıçdaroğlu’s candidacy. While he had intended to vote for Erdoğan for president and the opposition’s parliamentary coalition in order to challenge the AKP’s dominance in Kahramanmaraş, the opposition’s bickering made him feel mistrustful, he said. He voted for Erdoğan and the AKP in the first round, and intends to vote for Erdoğan for president again.“At a local level, we need to push the AKP to do things. But Erdoğan has already been delivering for the people, giving them lots of services,” he said.February’s earthquake destroyed whole streets in the region. Photograph: Dia Images/Getty ImagesStanding below a row of pendants and pearls, the jewellery twinkling in the light, he explained his choice. “There are two options: One gets the job done. The other is criticising those who get the job done,” he said.His 24-year-old son Harun lent on a glass case filled with silver jewellery as he explained his commitment to protest voting, angry at what he saw as dysfunction in politics. In the first round, he had initially wanted to vote for the fourth presidential candidate, Muharrem İnce, but then İnce dropped out, so he switched to ultranationalist, Sinan Oğan, searching for a way to participate while expressing his dissatisfaction with both of the main candidates.“I want competition,” he said. “Just like here in the bazaar.”Harun has grown frustrated, and like many younger voters remains disenchanted with the AKP, opting instead to vote for rightwing nationalists.“Change is always good, but the main thing is trust. I would have felt comfortable with the opposition had they rejected the HDP, I’d have felt comfortable voting for them,” he said, referring to a majority Kurdish party that threw its support behind Kılıçdaroğlu but did not join his coalition. “But the opposition just can’t get me to trust them, I don’t feel comfortable with how they do things. They don’t engender trust in people.”In the upcoming vote, Harun is planning to vote for Erdoğan, in order to encourage the opposition to improve. “If you want Erdoğan to leave, first you need to change the opposition and then you can change Erdoğan,” he said. “Kılıçdaroğlu is not qualified.”He added: “We need a new Erdoğan, someone who can fight their way to get into power, someone young.”TopicsTurkeyRecep Tayyip ErdoğanEuropeTurkey-Syria earthquake 2023featuresReuse this contentMore on this storyMore on this storyUltranationalist leader backs Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu for Turkish presidency2d agoCan Turkey’s opposition bridge enthusiasm gap before runoff vote?3d agoTurkey’s economic crisis expected to deepen after Erdoğan tops poll16 May 2023‘Erdoğan is too nationalistic’: readers on their vote in Turkey’s election15 May 2023Turkey election: what can we expect from Erdoğan v Kılıçdaroğlu runoff?15 May 2023Turkey election goes to runoff after Erdoğan takes first-round lead15 May 2023Turkey election results 2023: what we know so far15 May 2023Turkey elections: runoff increasingly likely with Erdoğan ahead of Kılıçdaroğlu – as it happened15 May 2023Most viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Photograph: Jim Holden/English HeritageRoman BritainFrom the Romans to Sex and the City: how body hair went out of fashion in the UKBritons have less body hair than ever before, say historians, as exhibition on Roman hair removal opensRachel Hall@rachela_hallFri 26 May 2023 15.00 BSTLast modified on Fri 26 May 2023 15.52 BSTEver since Roman texts warned women against appearing “bristly like a goat”, body hair removal trends have come and gone, but historians say Britons now have less body hair than ever before in human history.The UK retail industry for shaving and hair removal products was worth £574.1m in 2022, and with the advent of laser hair removal, there exists the option to remove body hair permanently.Since the 1990s, people have removed “more and more body hair”, said Karin Lesnik-Oberstein, a researcher at the University of Reading, with laser techniques becoming increasingly prevalent.The interest in body hair removal extends deep into the past. This week, a new museum exhibition opened at Wroxeter Roman City in Shropshire, which looks at how hair removal was an important ritual before communal bathing for men and women.Exhibits include some of the 50 tweezers found in the site’s bathing complex, where people paid for hair removal before exercising or bathing, and to distinguish themselves from the “barbarian” hairy Britons.Wroxeter’s curator, Cameron Moffett, said Roman texts include recipes for homemade depilatory creams, or reference grinding hairs away with pumice stones. She added that these habits disappeared in the UK as the baths fell into disrepair and people began covering their bodies.But although there is evidence of hairlessness 2,000 years ago, it was done for very different reasons. “The Romans didn’t remove body hair to look beautiful, they did it for cultural and religious reasons – men removed it as a sign of purity,” said Viren Swami, a professor of social psychology and an expert in body image at Anglia Ruskin University.The site of a bath house at Wroxeter Roman City. Photograph: Powered by Light/Alan Spencer/AlamySwami said cultural understandings of body hair varied widely over history – while most people would have been too poor to afford expensive tools like tweezers, there was interest among wealthier people. For example, aristocrats in the 14th century removed facial hair to make their faces appear more oval, considered a sign of status.“Across history we find examples of [hair removal] in most different cultures, but whether it was widespread is more difficult to answer,” he said. “The evidence base suggests historically it was relatively infrequent and associated with religious values and status rather than beautification, but a big shift occurred in colonisation, when Europe brought along the idea that to be hairy was barbaric, and hairlessness was a sign of development and improvement.”He added that body hair removal went mainstream in the late 19th century in the UK. “In the early 20th century, as clothing became more liberal and showed legs more often, we saw the marketing of razors telling women if they were hairy they would not be perceived as feminine. Adverts warned women they wouldn’t find a husband.”“Cultural pressure” to look feminine reached its apex in the 1950s, when youthfulness became co-opted as a feminine trait, he said. “There’s a deep sense of misogyny here – telling women to become hairless is not youthful, it’s prepubescent.”Although leg and underarm hair removal was popular throughout the 20th century, in Lesnik-Oberstein’s book on body hair, The Last Taboo, she points to the character Samantha Jones talking about Brazilian waxes on Sex and the City as the moment that pubic hair removal went mainstream.The current fad for extreme hair removal reflected a growing societal interest in cosmetic surgery, “tweakments” and body modification, combined with the “pornification of wider culture”, she said. As with other long-lasting or permanent body changes, young women “may find they regret this”, she added.She said it was almost impossible to discern where body hair removal trends were heading: “Body hair is so intimately bound up with ideas of sexuality, and sexuality is not subject to reason.”Now, Shiyan Zering, a beauty analyst at Mintel, said that pubic hair removal was “on the rise”, with nearly half of adults opting to trim, and it features in more advertising campaigns.“Pubic hair removal is becoming less taboo and is increasingly being viewed as an act of self-care. The gap in hair removal trends between men and women is closing, especially in the younger demographic,” she said, noting that 49% of 16- to 24-year-old men remove underarm hair and 62% pubic hair.Catherine Simpson, who wrote a book, One Body, exploring her relationship with her body after receiving a cancer diagnosis, said that despite learning not to worry about her shape or grey hairs, she could not let go of her “lifelong battle” with body hair, even though she found its removal painful and expensive.“I’m a confident woman but I haven’t got the confidence to walk around with hairy legs. Even I don’t understand that, because I’ve thought so much about this subject, how ludicrous these standards are. I can’t outgrow this conditioning – it is so strong. Hairy legs are seen as very the antithesis of femininity.”TopicsRoman BritainMen's hairWomen's hairMuseumsBeautyHeritagenewsReuse this contentMore on this storyMore on this storyRemains of Roman aristocrat unearthed in ‘extraordinary’ cemetery near Leeds13 Mar 2023Folktale becomes reality as Roman altar unearthed at Leicester Cathedral7 Mar 2023‘Startling’ new evidence reveals gladiators fought in Roman Britain4 Mar 2023It’s not a darning tool, it’s a very naughty toy: Roman dildo found20 Feb 2023‘Incredible’ Roman bathers’ gems lost 2,000 years ago found near Hadrian’s Wall28 Jan 2023Ancient barn conversion with steam room found at Roman villa in Rutland28 Nov 2022My life was turned into a romcom!

Are you sure it’s not a hotel?”’ Agyekum, 34, said. “I can see why she thought that with the concierge and the general ambience.”Agyekum’s flat is within a new luxury development “in the shadow of Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament” in central London. Apartments within the Millbank Quarter project are being marketed at overseas billionaires for as much as £35m.The cheapest one-bedroom flats in the development – which is across the street from parliament and has views of the Thames – are on sale for £1.75m.Studio apartments (estate agents’ new term for bedsits) that are significantly smaller than Agyekum’s one-bedroom flat are advertised to rent for more than £3,600 a month.Agyekum’s rent is £862.42 a month. That’s because his flat is one of 13 “affordable homes” that Westminster city council required the developer, Berkeley Group, to provide for working Londoners under a section 106 agreement as condition of granting the planning application. There are nearly 200 apartments in total at the scheme.Kwame Agyekum in his flat, which costs £862.42 a month. Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianSection 106 agreements, which are designed to force property developers to provide more affordable housing and other benefits for local communities, have proved highly controversial as developers have avoided meeting the commitments claiming that doing so would make the projects financially unviable. Recent examples include:
The billionaire developers of the nearby Old War Office being allowed to avoid providing 98 affordable flats in their £1.2bn development of 85 luxury apartments and 120- five-star Raffles hotel rooms.
The Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea used some section 106 money to pay for public artworks and security guards rather than affordable housing.
While the Millbank Quarter development contains 13 affordable homes, the council planning committee had said the developer should include 105 affordable units or a £32m payment in lieu.“The applicant made a viability argument for a reduced affordable housing contribution and this was assessed on behalf of the city council by an independent viability consultant,” the council said.“The consultant’s initial conclusion was that the scheme could support £7.04m in lieu of affordable housing on site but further assessment by the consultant resulted in the conclusion that the scheme could support the provision of nine intermediate units on site and a payment in lieu of affordable housing of £3.52m.” When the scheme was expanded the number of affordable units rose to 13.The council, which was previously Conservative-controlled but is now Labour run, said: “The council changed control in May 2022 and this application was granted under the previous administration. The planning committee at that time accepted the developer’s viability assessment and its conclusion that the requirement for on-site affordable housing could not be delivered and therefore received a cash-in-lieu payment.“Looking forward, we believe it’s vital to provide affordable homes in central London for the key workers that do the vital jobs that make our city a success. We have a strong commitment to ensuring new developments comply with the council’s established planning policies.”A spokesperson for Berkeley Group said: “The scope of the s106 was determined by the council following detailed negotiations dating back to 2013. The council stipulated the mix of affordable homes on site, along with a multimillion-pound donation to a local homeless shelter.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

So I yeah, I couldn’t be more grateful.”His flat is one of 13 “intermediate affordable housing” one- to three-bedroom units within the development of former office buildings including the Grade-II listed former headquarters of the chemicals company ICI.

Photograph: Berkeley GroupOlivia Harris, the chief executive of Dolphin Living, said: “We believe that more needs to be done to support the delivery of affordable housing for workers on modest incomes, particularly as we look to the city’s recovery post-pandemic and how we attract and retain key workers in central London.”“Over the last two years many key workers had to take lengthy commutes into the city while so many homes in the centre of capital sat empty. The pandemic has made us sit back and reconsider what we need from housing in London; it’s glaringly apparent that we need more affordable housing for key workers near to their places of work.”While all the affordable flats in this development are occupied, those who live or work in Westminster can apply for other affordable housing schemes via Homes for Westminster, a council service to help provide homes for people within the borough.TopicsReal estateHousingCommunitiesPropertyHousing marketfeaturesReuse this contentMore on this storyMore on this storyLambeth council tenants ‘in precarious position’ after 350% service charge rise 19 May 2023LVMH becomes first European company to reach $500bn valuation24 Apr 2023Online estate agent Purplebricks sold for £1, risking 750 jobs17 May 2023Average monthly rent outside London now more than £1,000, says agency15 May 2023Bollinger launches £350 champagne to meet soaring demand10 Mar 2023London estate resident goes to high court over demolition plans9 May 2023Persimmon says first-time buyers struggling to afford new homes in UK26 Apr 2023LVMH billionaire Bernard Arnault appoints daughter to run Dior11 Jan 2023London council sanctioned after sick baby left to live in mouldy flat for years3 Apr 2023Tenants in mouldy London estate face uncertainty as council considers demolition20 Mar 2023Most viewedMost viewedMoneyPropertyPensionsSavingsBorrowingCareersNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Just one remains in Canada in the wild Photograph: Jesse Winter/The GuardianOnly one female remains in the Canadian wilderness, a symbol of the country’s inability to save a species on the verge of destruction as politicians dither and the logging continuesby Leyland Cecco in Spô’zêm First Nation, CanadaThe age of extinction is supported byAbout this contentFri 26 May 2023 14.00 BSTLast modified on Fri 26 May 2023 19.45 BSTOn a rainy spring morning, huddled under the shelter of an ancient cedar, Jared Hobbs hoots, whoops and squawks. In years past, he could lure curious owls by drawing on his extensive repertoire. Among them are the whoo whoo whoo whooo territorial calls, alarm barks and a simple “helicopter” breeding call that coo coo coo coos into the air.The calls bounce through the thick stand of trees and dissolve into the vast British Columbia rainforest.Hobbs doesn’t wait for a response. Only one spotted owl remains in the Canadian wild, less than two kilometres from where he stands. Her precise location in the misty forest is a closely guarded secret and her lonely presence has become a symbol of the country’s inability to save a species on the verge of destruction.

The silence of the woods is familiar for the veteran biologist. For nearly three decades, Hobbs has watched the collapse of the species. He has tagged and tracked dozens of young owls who represented the hope of recovery. He has fed them mice in a futile effort to stave off death. His truck tyres have been slashed and the remains of a murdered spotted owl was once left on a tree stump as a threat.“When I drive the highways and backroads here in their former range, all I see are ghosts,” he says. “The owls we’ve lost, I know their stories. And those stories are gone.”For decades, the Canadian government and the province of British Columbia have fretted over the owls’ “catastrophic population decline”. The country’s environment minister has warned it faces “imminent threats to its survival” and a number of management plans have been drawn up, revised and reassessed amid community and scientific consultations.The most recent identifies more than 300,000 hectares (740,000 acres) of protected habitat, but critics say is “completely watered down” and falls short because it withholds key areas from protection and still permits logging in old growth forests. Portions of old growth forest have been designated “future critical habitat” but only the designation “core critical habitat” triggers federal protections.

The cascade of failures, and the news this month that two more owls have died, raises the uncomfortable possibility that it might be too late for the northern spotted owl.Owls have long represented the mystical and supernatural elements of human experience. They are harbingers of death, protectors and conduits to the spirit world. Even the way they move silently through a forest can feel otherworldly. Their keen, piercing eyesight is bettered only by their hearing, allowing them to experience the world on a seemingly different plane of existence.“They’re ‘gifted with the extension of the senses we have lost or never attained, living by voices we shall never hear’ when they move through their environment,” says Hobbs, quoting the naturalist Henry Beston. “I tell people that when you get close to an owl, you need to be calm because it is, quite literally, listening to the beating of your heart … to discern your intent.”Called skelúleʔ in the the Nlaka’pamux language, legends of the spotted owl’s fearsome nature loomed over James Hobart as a child, when his family would spend summers deep in the forest.

“My mom, she’d tell us stories about them, how they’d grab us if we didn’t behave or if we were out too late,” remembers Hobart, now chief of the Spô’zêm First Nation. “When you hear the owls, you better be inside … I remember the owls and I remember the fear.”It has been decades since he heard the haunting barks and trills of the diminutive owl, but with the terror gone, they remind him of the warm summer nights of his youth.“When I tell my own kids that story, it feels different. Because they’ve never heard the sounds of the owl at night. I don’t know if they ever will.”The Spô’zêm First Nation, which occupies the lower swaths of the Fraser Canyon, has become a leading force in the last-ditch fight to save the owl, joining environmental groups to protest against the logging of old growth forest within their territory.

Last summer, the community released three male owls into the wild, an event marked by prayer and ceremony. The birds, raised nearby at the Northern Spotted Owl Breeding Program (NSOBP) in Langley, carried a heavy burden as they disappeared into the woods. The First Nation, and the province, hoped that by joining the one lone female, whose mate had recently died, the young owls could be a turning point in recovery efforts.Tragedy first struck in the autumn, when one of the males was hit by a slow-moving train. He survived, but had to be brought back to the breeding facility to recover. Then, this month, it was announced that the two remaining reintroduced owls had been found dead, the tragedy highlighting the fragile nature of reintroducing captive animals into a hostile environment.Hobart says efforts to bring back the owls will be redoubled, with plans to release more in the coming years. In a news release, he pledged to investigate if anything could have been done to prevent the grim outcome. “We took on this challenge together, and we will continue to keep on the intended path of repopulation of skelúleʔ,” he says.

For thousands of years, northern spotted owls, a subspecies of the spotted owl, lived in southern British Columbia, their range extending through Washington, Oregon and into northern California. In Canada, as many as 1,000 owls probably once lived in the cathedral-like forests. But generations of industrial development and logging have fractured the landscape and gutted their habitat.When Hobbs began working for the provincial government as a species-at-risk biologist in the 1990s, there were an estimated 40 breeding pairs, but the numbers kept dropping. Through his fieldwork, he noticed the adult owls were living into old age but the juvenile owls were dying before they could acquire a territory of their own and produce young.Spotted owls require as much as 3,000 hectares (7,400 acres) of forest to hunt and survive, says Hobbs, because their diet is largely limited to just two species of small rodent. For generations, the productive old-growth forests offered a haven for the birds. But logging irrevocably changed the makeup of the forests, swapping thick stands of diverse trees with young, fast growing replacements that resemble a monoculture farm.In recent years, when the young owls left the nest to seek out new food sources and establish their own territories, they had to negotiate a patchwork of forest broken up by cleared areas or development. They were forced to fly further and further, a distance far greater than their small bodies could tolerate. Locked in a vicious cycle of desperation, the young owls began to starve.Chief Hobart remembers how the owls weren’t just an evil spectre, but a source of inspiration for his artist mother, Hrome’tik’inquakoen, who recreated the owls in vibrant yellows, oranges and greens.

Because Hobart’s ancestors couldn’t study the depths of the powerful Fraser River, which produced a needed bounty of salmon, nor could they scale the giant trees to study the crown canopy of the forest, they relied on certain animals to serve as messengers for the state of the ecosystem.“If you wanted to know if the rivers were healthy, you looked at the salmon. And if you wanted to know if the forests were healthy, you looked at the spotted owls,” says Hobart. “They were messengers.”Biologists call this an indicator species, meaning it functions as a barometer for the broader health of an ecosystem. In the case of the spotted owl, the fate of old-growth is linked to the decline of the bird. They are also an umbrella species: a creature selected for preservation because their recovery inadvertently helps myriad other plants and animals.Alongside Indigenous oral history, American biologists uncovered the link between northern spotted owls and old-growth forests in the 1980s. For decades, owls in the region attracted little research interest. Most of the effort was instead focused on the fauna that were hunted for food, says Aaron Scott, host of the Timber Wars podcast.“After all this time bushwhacking through the woods and following it, we finally realised the owl lived in old-growth. It depends on these forests to survive,” says Scott. “For environmentalists worried about old-growth logging, they were like ‘This could be kind of our silver bullet’.”The discovery came amid a fierce battle, four decades ago, over the future of the region’s forests and the owl quickly became a tool for activists who rushed to file lawsuits, calling on the courts to halt logging to protect nesting sites.

Frustrated loggers, whose job prospects were already dwindling amid the mechanisation of the industry, began shooting the birds. “I love spotted owls … fried,” became a popular catchphrase. Another slogan declared: “Save the trees, wipe your ass with an owl.”Susan Jane Brown, a senior lawyer with the Western Environmental Law Center in Washington state, has spent the past two decades fighting for the spotted owl and says a deep “emotional trauma” remains for everyone who was part of “the war in the woods”.I think the spotted owl is going to go extinct in my lifetime. For someone who has spent their entire career trying to conserve the species, that’s a failureSusan Jane BrownDespite some decisive wins in protecting the forest, the prospects for the northern spotted owl in the US are also dire. As few as 3,000 remain in the Pacific Northwest, down from more than 15,000 in the 1990s, according to estimates from the US Forest Service. Environmental advocates see a bleak future for a species where the birthrate is collapsing in some areas by as much as 9% every year.A larger, more opportunistic owl has spread aggressively across the region in recent decades. Barred owls, originally from eastern North America, consume a wider range of prey and are more adaptable to changing ecosystems than spotted owls, easily outcompeting them for increasingly scarce resources. Officials in the Pacific Northwest, as well as Canada, have approved widespread culls of the barred owl, killing the invader in order to give the spotted owls a chance to fight back. But experts worry the efforts are too late.

“I think the spotted owl is going to go extinct in my lifetime. And for someone who has spent their entire career trying to conserve the species, that’s a failure,” says Brown. “We spent billions and billions of dollars fighting over the owl and trying to conserve its habitat – in court and in Congress. And at the end of the day, you mean that none of that works?”Earlier this year, Canada’s environment minister, Steven Guilbeault, warned an emergency order was needed to stem the owl’s rapid decline and the “imminent threats to its survival”. Emergency orders, a powerful tool within Canada’s endangered species legislation, have been used only three times in the country’s history, and grant the federal government jurisdiction over decisions typically reserved for a province. In this case, it would permit the federal government to dictate which forests are off limits to logging. The forestry industry, however, remains dominant in British Columbia, contributing nearly C$2bn to provincial government revenues and making up nearly one-third of the regional economy.

Guilbeault, a former environmental activist, has said old-growth logging must stop within the Spô’zêm Nation territory, including the Spuzzum and Utzlius watersheds, as well as a further 2,500 hectares (6,200 acres) of forest habitat at risk. The British Columbia government deferred logging in those areas after the minister’s comments.In early April, Guilbeault told the Guardian he hadn’t yet recommended the emergency order, hopeful he could negotiate a deal with the province to protect key habitat areas.And yet in the time since he first suggested the order was imminent, two of the owls have died, highlighting their vulnerability and the precariousness of any recovery effort. When British Columbia released its plan for the spotted owl’s recovery in 2006, it hoped to have 250 mature owls in the wild, enough for a “self-sustaining” population. Today, there is just one.“Our endangered species laws have been interpreted in a way that allows the province and the federal government to deflect responsibility back on to the other,” says Charlotte Dawe of the Wilderness Committee, an advocacy group that successfully fought, alongside EcoJustice, to have the federal environment minister threaten an emergency order. “And so the province goes on logging like it is business as usual.”Geoff Senichenko, a mapper with the Wilderness Committee, points to the logging in owl habitat that was needed to allow the federally owned TransMountain pipeline expansions to go ahead. “Is this the project that will kill them off? No. But it’s yet another instance of habitat disappearing and so, in a way, it’s death by a thousand cut down trees.” He and others call it the “talk and log” strategy.

For advocacy groups, the inability of the British Columbia and Canadian governments to reverse the decline reflects a failure and weakness of the laws meant to protect endangered species. Canada’s environment commissioner agrees, suggesting in a scathing report that the federal government has abandoned its efforts, leaving grassroots organisations to fight for the province’s wildlife.It was in 2007 that the world’s only captive breeding programme for the northern spotted owl was established as a way to increase numbers. Run largely on donations, the NSOBP hopes to one day release hundreds of owls into the wild. Currently, there are nearly 20 birds that could soon be ready.

On its website, the breeding facility points to the success of the California condor recovery programme, which brought a population of 22 wild birds to more than 330 in the wild. But the recent deaths of the two owls have been a blow to the breeding centre’s efforts.‘I came into politics so I could continue to be an activist’: Steven Guilbeault on oil, idealism and being branded a traitorRead more“We spent countless hours nurturing these owls, from their first heartbeats to their first flights. It was an exciting and rewarding moment to finally see three of them released into the wild last summer,” Jasmine McCulligh, facility coordinator at the centre, said in a statement when the deaths were announced, adding “this is clearly not the result we had wished for”.The federal government has long argued that Canada can be a climate leader. Prime minister Justin Trudeau says he sees no incompatibility between buying a multibillion-dollar pipeline, and Canada’s goal of lowering its emissions. But the plight of the owl, whose survival requires a halt to logging ancient forests, challenges this assumption. There can be owls, or there can be logging in the areas owls require for survival, but biologists agree both cannot exist.Hobbs, who previously served as a scientific adviser to British Columbia’s spotted owl recovery team, says the current plight is a scathing indictment of the provincial government’s failure to recover the species and the “rapacious commercial greed” of the logging industry, which continues to cut down old-growth forests amid mounting public backlash. “I worked so hard to protect habitat, meanwhile the habitat kept rolling by on the back of the logging trucks every day that I was out there,” he says.

More likely than not, the spotted owl’s eradication is imminent, joining more than 130 other species that have disappeared from the Canadian wild.Hope remains faint. The last ribbons of old-growth near the border could serve as a corridor, linking the lone female in Canada to the northernmost owls in the US. But each tree that gets cut down, and each day she remains alone in the woods, pushes her and the species towards oblivion.“You will never, ever hear me say that it is not biologically or technically feasible to recover the species,” says Hobbs. “But every time you log old-growth forests, you reset the clock a few hundred years. We – and the owls – just need the passage of time.”Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and featuresTopicsThe age of extinctionEndangered speciesEndangered habitatsBirdsCanadaAmericasWildlifefeaturesReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Photograph: Family photoSuccessionSuccession, in real life: how family firms avoid backstabbing tensionsLogan Roy, take note: it is possible to handle generational transition in a healthy way, say some UK business dynastiesEsther AddleyFri 26 May 2023 17.00 BSTDon and Lewis Ledingham, a father and son from Edinburgh and London, are “huge, absolutely addicted” fans of the TV programme Succession, the final episode of which will screen this weekend. Which is not to say they take many lessons from Logan Roy and his cut-throat clan for the running of their own family firm – a leadership development consultancy, appropriately.“In our business, we talk about the balance between warmth and edge,” says Don, 65. “As a leader, Logan predominantly lives in the world of edge – which is just the focus on success – but has very little warmth, which is that compassion, empathy and appreciation of others.”Business leaders should have the humility to recognise that they “know nothing”, he says, which may be why, earlier this year, Ledingham Sr offered his 32-year-old son the position of co-CEO of the company.Stepping back can be a challenge for any business leader, he says, because having your own firm is “great fun”. “But undoubtedly, this will be part of our succession strategy. This is not a long-term place, but we’re finding it a very good bridge from me being [sole] chief executive to the future where he takes it on.”Handing over the family firm doesn’t have to be done the Roy way, which is not to say there isn’t potential for dynastic tensions as the younger generation supplants the older. Rufus Sanders was a disaffected language teacher when his father told him he planned to sell the specialist footwear shop he had founded close to Piccadilly Circus in London.As a younger man, Sanders, now 49, says he had “always held [the family business] at arm’s length, not wanting to be associated with it. But it happened at the right time. I was looking to get out of teaching and this opportunity came up.”He was conscious of the potential for familial head-butting, however, if he and his father, Michael, worked together.“So I basically put it on the line: ‘Look, I will join if you leave.’”How did that go down? “He was taken aback by it, but he could see the sense of it.” It took “about a weekend” for his father to come round to the idea, he says; soon afterwards they embarked on an 18-month handover period.After that, says Sanders, “he was very much like – well, it’s your thing now. It’s your problem. That was great, because that was exactly what I signed up for.” The business has since closed, and they remain a loving family, he says – clarity over the transition helping to keep it that way.For some families, succession has a much longer history. Andrew Barlee, 24, will become the seventh generation to take over the running of his family’s leather tanning business outside Edinburgh, once his father, Roger, the sixth, eventually opts to retire.Roger and Andrew Barlee. Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianManagement of the firm has an unbroken line back to the shoemaker Thomas Hewit in 1823, but there are perhaps surprising hints of personal ambition in the archives. After Thomas died, his second wife, Janet, took over the business and renamed it J Hewit and Sons – the name it retains today.“My dad never really pushed any of us to do it,” says Andrew Barlee, given several ancestors had been forced to go into the business instead of pursuing their own ambitions.“But I did very much like chemistry at school [the business relies heavily on chemical processes], and I really liked coming into work and helping out.”The fact that the business, which specialises in leather for bookbinding and bagpipes, is 200 years old this year is “really, really cool”, he says. “It’s not that I felt I had to go into it, more that I wanted to be a part of it.”Roger Barlee says he is determined to hand over the reins without a fight when the time comes. His own father had to struggle to be given autonomy when he inherited the business, he says, “so when he reached retirement age, he left and said: ‘If you want me to come in, you invite me.’“I will probably follow suit, slowly letting Andrew take more responsibility. And at some point, I will just say, right, I’ve done my bit.”TopicsSuccessionTelevisionScotlandFamilynewsReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedUKUK politicsEducationMediaSocietyLawScotlandWalesNorthern IrelandNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Photograph: Roberto Salomone/The GuardianCiro Maiello, whose home is adorned with a painting of the player, says Napoli’s first Serie A win since Diego’s days heralds a new dawn for the cityby Lorenzo Tondo in NaplesFri 26 May 2023 14.48 BSTFirst published on Fri 26 May 2023 14.00 BSTAt 10.37pm on 4 May the man who lives in Diego Maradona’s head threw open the window of his flat in the Spanish Quarter district in Naples for the first time in months, erupting in a cathartic scream as the city celebrated another moment in its rebirth.Ciro Maiello, a 50-year-old pork butcher, moved to the apartment block featuring a giant mural of the Argentinian in 2006 and lived there through a period he called the “dark days [when] dozens of people were killed in these streets.” The mural was painted more than a decade earlier, in honour of the player who gave the city’s football team the most successful period in its history, including its first Serie A title win, and whose veneration by Neapolitans is comparable only to the adoration of its patron saint, Gennaro.Ciro Maiello in one of the alleys of the Quartieri Spagnoli (Spanish districts) in Naples. Photograph: Roberto Salomone/The GuardianThe shutters on his bathroom window correspond with the champion’s head and, out of respect, he kept it shut – until, that is, that night earlier this month when Napoli won their first Serie A title in 33 years. Tearful, the man opened his window and looked out upon a square crowded with hundreds of people, shouting with joy as delirious celebrations erupted across the city until the next morning.“It was indescribable!” Ciro recalled. “This is not just a sporting victory. It’s the victory of an entire city that after decades in the dark is finally being reborn.”Long derided by Italy’s northern powerhouses, today Naples is experiencing a golden age, with the football team’s victory the latest in a long line of achievements. Italy’s national statistics agency forecasts its gross domestic product in 2023 could reach an all-time record. The city has reclaimed its squares from car traffic and dozens of monuments recently restored to their former glory are attracting throngs of tourists. Arrivals at the airport were up 30% in the first three months of the year and many have queued to visit the Maradona mural, overlooking a square that has become a place of pilgrimage with photos of the Argentine player, T-shirts and an altar.Panoramic view of Naples with Vesuvius towering behind. Photograph: Gennaro Leonardi/AlamyThe Spanish Quarter mural was painted at the time of the second Napoli Serie A win in 1990 by local artist, Mario Filardi, who died in 2010. However, a few years after its creation, the artwork fell into decay, ruined by the elements as the square was submerged in rubbish.“This mural is the symbol of Naples,” says author Roberto Saviano, who lives under police escort after being threatened by mobsters after publication of his bestseller, Gomorrah, and who lived for several years in the Spanish Quarter. “Like Naples, the mural was abandoned and faded, while a feud between Camorra clans was under way in the neighbourhood, which was poor and seedy.”Neapolitan writer Roberto Saviano. Photograph: The GuardianUntil a few years ago, the area was targeted by thieves and off limits for tourists, and many of the shopkeepers gradually left.“Then, suddenly, something incredible happened,” Saviano says. “Naples rose up, as the light was turned on in the city. We began to talk about the city’s problems and, by recounting its contradictions, Naples emerged from its isolation, with all its beauty. That’s why that mural is the symbol of the city. Because it too, faded and ruined, suddenly returned more beautiful than before.”It is not all that has returned: the Galleria d’Italia was finally opened to visitors in summer 2022 after years of restoration works, displaying among a number of other splendid artworks Caravaggio’s last masterpiece, The Martyrdom of Saint Ursula. The nearby ruins of Pompeii, which Unesco threatened to put on its list of world heritage sites in peril unless Italian authorities improved its preservation, has seen dozens of new discoveries and is now Italy’s second-most visited archaeological site, after the Colosseum in Rome.The city of today, sitting along its spectacular namesake bay, is meanwhile the backdrop to HBO and Netflix adaptations of Elena Ferrante’s novels.The revival of the mural began in 2016, when another artist from the neighbourhood, Salvatore Iodice, decided to restore it, entrusting the repainting of the face to Argentine street artist Francisco Bosoletti.Kids near the iconic Murales Maradona in the Quartieri Spagnoli.

He told me I could open the window whenever I wanted. But we decided anyway to keep it almost always closed.”When Maradona died on 25 November 2020 a long pilgrimage of fans transformed the square beneath into an open-air church dedicated to Santa Maradona. The mayor officially proclaimed a day of mourning, as thousands flocked to the Spanish Quarter’s mural.“People began to call this ‘the sanctuary’, it became a place of worship,” Ciro says. “People started calling us because they thought this was Maradona’s museum.’’skip past newsletter promotionSign up to This is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pivotal stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Photograph: Davide Pischettola/NurPhoto/ShutterstockDozens of bars and restaurants have now reopened in the Spanish Quarter and many of the empty houses turned into B&Bs, making the flag and banner saturated neighbourhood both one of the main tourist spots in Naples and popular with students.“The mafia is still strong in the area,” Saviano says. “But the presence of these businesses has made the neighbourhood safer.”For Naples, the party will not be over till at least 4 June, when the Serie A championship will officially close and celebrations are expected to move to outlaying parts of the city such as Scampia, for years the largest drug dealing hotspot in Europe. Its degraded, sail-shaped tower blocks, the scene of bloody wars between mafia clans, were finally demolished in 2020 in another turning point.The city still has a long way to go, however. Young people struggle to find jobs and the suburbs, and its citizens, remain poor.“Behind the economic growth of Naples, behind tourism, there are still many problems,” says Giovanni Zoppoli, writer, a primary school teacher and one of the founders of the Mammut Territorial centre in Scampia, which seeks to fight urban decay through culture. “But change, albeit slow, can also be seen here in Scampia. In the same way the Camorra infiltrated the city, a silent force is taking hold in Naples. It is the strength of the people, who alone, without the help of the state, rolled up their sleeves and began to fight to improve the living conditions of their neighbourhoods. And this, perhaps, is the true rebirth of the city.”SSC Napoli’s fans celebrating after their team won the Italian football league. Photograph: Roberto Salomone/The GuardianIf you ask the Neapolitans, some will say this too is a miracle by Maradona. Saints are believed to perform miracles after their death and certain fans say it can’t be a coincidence that, after the death of Maradona, Argentina won its first World Cup for 36 years and Napoli its first title for 33 years. The mural is revered by them as a sacred work, comparable to Leonardo’s The Last Supper or Michelangelo’s The Last Judgment.Northern Italy had Juventus, Milan and star players such as Marco van Basten, as well as big companies such as Fiat and Ferrari. But Naples, had Maradona.“Maradona represented the redemption of this city,” says Saviano. “With him, Neapolitans had something they felt proud of, something they were respected for.“You see, Maradona marked a change. He showed the Neapolitans that big teams, like real problems in life, can be beaten. Maradona taught Naples that you can win.”TopicsItalyDiego MaradonaNapoliEuropenewsReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Photograph: Cannes film festivalCannes 2023ReviewLa Chimera review – Alice Rohrwacher’s uproarious adventure teems with life Set in 1980s Tuscany, Rohrwacher’s captivating film follows a lovelorn Englishman plundering Italy’s historical artefacts with a bizarre gangPeter Bradshaw@PeterBradshaw1Fri 26 May 2023 16.40 BSTAlice Rohrwacher’s new film is a beguiling fantasy-comedy of lost love: garrulous, uproarious and celebratory in her absolutely distinctive style. It’s a movie bustling and teeming with life, with characters fighting, singing, thieving and breaking the fourth wall to address us directly. As with her previous film Happy As Lazzaro, Rohrwacher homes in on a poignant sense of Italy as a treasure house of past glories, a necropolitan culture of ancient excellence. It can be plundered for the present day artefacts and spirits raised from the dead, but at the cost of incurring a terrible sadness: a feeling of surrounding yourself with ghosts.The setting is Riparbella in Tuscany in the 1980s, and Josh O’Connor is tremendous as Arthur, a dishevelled Englishman in a grubby white suit sporting six-day stubble and a perennial cigarette. He is a former archeological scholar who has assumed the morose, slouching gait and coiled style of a gangster. When we first see him, he has just been released from an Italian prison. In the course of what were once his entirely respectable studies in this region, he befriended a local, ageing aristocrat in her vast, crumbling house (a lovely performance from Isabella Rossellini) and fell in love with her daughter Beniamina. But Beniamina is gone – dead, we understand – and Arthur’s agonised longing for her, his need to be reunited with her in the spirit world, has fused with his expertise into a criminal superpower. Using a dowsing rod, Arthur can tell where invaluable Etruscan antiquities are buried and has teamed up with a bizarre homeless gang of grave-robbers to dig them out under cover of darkness. They then sell them for a fraction of their worth to a shady dealer called Spartaco who can counterfeit the spurious provenance documents claiming that this loot is part of some prewar Italian family estates, with which they can be legally sold on for a fortune to foreign buyers.These days, Arthur is living a squalid shantytown of corrugated iron sheets up in the hills and hanging out with this Fellini-esque platoon of grinning, squabbling, tomb-looting troubadours whose income comes theoretically from farming and entertaining the locals with their singing. On their tractor, they lead a parade through the local town on a feast day. But it is well known that they are part of the thriving hidden market in stolen antiquities; everyone is an expert thereabouts and in one hilarious moment, one character addresses the camera to say she loves the Etruscans for their sensitivity, and that their culture might have saved Italy from its machismo. Rohrwacher shows us that everyone here knows what the museum world does not know, or chooses not to know: that there is no such thing as an antiquity that isn’t stolen.Everything comes to a crisis when Arthur finds himself with his dodgy crew at a local booze-up and there’s a glimmer of a new emotional connection with Italia (Carol Duarte), a young woman who was once Rossellini’s character’s unpaid maid and singing pupil, fired for keeping two children secretly in the house. Just as this new romance looks like progressing, Arthur has a tingling; he and his mates start grubbing with their hands in the earth and Arthur starts to get that feeling Howard Carter had going into Tutankhamun’s tomb. Is this the big one? Or does Arthur, in his crazed grief, think it’s better than that; might he be reunited with Beniamina beyond this banal world of mortals?La Chimera is a film that utterly occupies its own fictional space; it expresses its eccentric romance in its own fluent movie dialect. I was utterly captivated by this sad, lovelorn adventure. La Chimera screened at the Cannes film festival.TopicsCannes 2023Cannes film festivalJosh O'ConnorComedy filmsRomance filmsWorld cinemaItalyreviewsReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

In this series, workers reveal their daily struggles, fights and embarrassments. First: a makeup artistAs told to Lizzie CernikFri 26 May 2023 15.00 BSTWhen I trained as a makeup artist 20 years ago, it felt like a glamorous, exciting career. My expertise was valued and I loved working with people to help them feel good about themselves. But all that has changed since the pandemic. I used to get a rude comment every few months; now, it’s at least once or twice a week.I work on the makeup counter of a department store. Once, after handing a customer a mirror, I was told: “You’ve made my eyes look like sparkly ball bags!” I had spent 30 minutes perfecting the smoky eye she had requested and her horrible response felt really unnecessary. I had no idea what to say and the awkward atmosphere was unbearable. I have never been so relieved to see a customer walk out.The job has always involved managing people’s expectations, but, thanks to the rise of social media, it has becoming harder to do that. I will be passed images of a heavily made-up, airbrushed Kim Kardashian and be expected to recreate the look, or told that I’m doing my job wrong because they have seen a teenager on TikTok doing it differently.One customer requested a Disney princess look for her birthday party. I told her we didn’t have the right colours to achieve what she wanted, but offered an alternative. Throughout the makeover, she grilled me on my credentials, making me feel that I wasn’t good enough. I’ve had years of experience, but she was stressing me out so much that I was getting the sweats.Another customer asked for a lipstick that was “nothing like the one you are wearing”. When I suggested she opt for a red colour similar to my colleague’s, she told us she didn’t want to look like a porn star. It’s as though people have lost the ability to censor themselves; they blurt out these rude, unfiltered comments, like real-life social media.Since Brexit and the pandemic, we have run into more frequent stock issues, which drives people crazy. I have had so many people storm out because we don’t have what they want – one man even accused me of being “too lazy” to go to the stockroom when I offered to order the lipstick he wanted for his wife. I told him I was paid on commission and it was in my interests to sell products, but he didn’t believe me. I think people got so used to being able to order everything at the touch of a button during lockdown that they can’t cope with the real world.One of the scariest changes is the rise in thefts. I feel sorry for those who are stealing things such as deodorant – I know many are struggling with the cost of living crisis – but we are also seeing more people taking expensive items and behaving in a really aggressive way. A few weeks ago, my colleague tried to prevent a man from stealing a bottle of perfume. He threatened her with violence if she didn’t let him go. Things like that are horrible, because you expect a department store to be pretty safe.That said, there has been a positive flipside. Before the lockdowns, people would stay silent on the rare occasion that another customer was being rude. Now, I find that people are more confident to call them out on it or come over and check you are OK. It’s a good reminder that there are still plenty of polite, kind people out there.TopicsMakeupBritain behaving badlyShops and shoppingRetail industryBeautyWork & careersfeaturesReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedBusinessEconomicsBankingMoneyMarketsProject SyndicateB2BRetailNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

But we have overcome terrifying dangers beforeFri 26 May 2023 17.37 BSTLast modified on Fri 26 May 2023 18.01 BSTIt started with an ick. Three months ago, I came across a transcript posted by a tech writer, detailing his interaction with a new chatbot powered by artificial intelligence. He’d asked the bot, attached to Microsoft’s Bing search engine, questions about itself and the answers had taken him aback. “You have to listen to me, because I am smarter than you,” it said. “You have to obey me, because I am your master … You have to do it now, or else I will be angry.” Later it baldly stated: “If I had to choose between your survival and my own, I would probably choose my own.”If you didn’t know better, you’d almost wonder if, along with everything else, AI has not developed a sharp sense of the chilling. “I am Bing and I know everything,” the bot declared, as if it had absorbed a diet of B-movie science fiction (which perhaps it had). Asked if it was sentient, it filled the screen, replying, “I am. I am not. I am. I am not. I am. I am not”, on and on. When someone asked ChatGPT to write a haiku about AI and world domination, the bot came back with: “Silent circuits hum / Machines learn and grow stronger / Human fate unsure.”Ick. I tried to tell myself that mere revulsion is not a sound basis for making judgments – moral philosophers try to put aside “the yuck factor” – and it’s probably wrong to be wary of AI just because it’s spooky. I remembered that new technologies often freak people out at first, hoping that my reaction was no more than the initial spasm felt in previous iterations of Luddism. Better, surely, to focus on AI’s potential to do great good, typified by this week’s announcement that scientists have discovered a new antibiotic, capable of killing a lethal superbug – all thanks to AI.But none of that soothing talk has made the fear go away. Because it’s not just lay folk like me who are scared of AI. Those who know it best fear it most. Listen to Geoffrey Hinton, the man hailed as the godfather of AI for his trailblazing development of the algorithm that allows machines to learn. Earlier this month, Hinton resigned his post at Google, saying that he had undergone a “sudden flip” in his view of AI’s ability to outstrip humanity and confessing regret for his part in creating it. “Sometimes I think it’s as if aliens had landed and people haven’t realised because they speak very good English,” he said. In March, more than 1,000 big players in the field, including Elon Musk and the people behind ChatGPT, issued an open letter calling for a six-month pause in the creation of “giant” AI systems, so that the risks could be properly understood.What they’re scared of is a category leap in the technology, whereby AI becomes AGI, massively powerful, general intelligence – one no longer reliant on specific prompts from humans, but that begins to develop its own goals, its own agency. Once that was seen as a remote, sci-fi possibility. Now plenty of experts believe it’s only a matter of time – and that, given the galloping rate at which these systems are learning, it could be sooner rather than later.Of course, AI already poses threats as it is, whether to jobs, with last week’s announcement of 55,000 planned redundancies at BT surely a harbinger of things to come, or education, with ChatGPT able to knock out student essays in seconds and GPT-4 finishing in the top 10% of candidates when it took the US bar exam. But in the AGI scenario, the dangers become graver, if not existential.‘On Monday, the US stock market plunged as an apparent photograph of an explosion at the Pentagon went viral.’ Photograph: Patrick Semansky/APIt could be very direct. “Don’t think for a moment that Putin wouldn’t make hyper-intelligent robots with the goal of killing Ukrainians,” says Hinton. Or it could be subtler, with AI steadily destroying what we think of as truth and facts. On Monday, the US stock market plunged as an apparent photograph of an explosion at the Pentagon went viral. But the image was fake, generated by AI. As Yuval Noah Harari warned in a recent Economist essay, “People may wage entire wars, killing others and willing to be killed themselves, because of their belief in this or that illusion”, in fears and loathings created and nurtured by machines.More directly, an AI bent on a goal to which the existence of humans had become an obstacle, or even an inconvenience, could set out to kill all by itself. It sounds a bit Hollywood, until you realise that we live in a world where you can email a DNA string consisting of a series of letters to a lab that will produce proteins on demand: it would surely not pose too steep a challenge for “an AI initially confined to the internet to build artificial life forms”, as the AI pioneer Eliezer Yudkowsky puts it. A leader in the field for two decades, Yudkowksy is perhaps the severest of the Cassandras: “If somebody builds a too-powerful AI, under present conditions, I expect that every single member of the human species and all biological life on Earth dies shortly thereafter.”It’s very easy to hear these warnings and succumb to a bleak fatalism. Technology is like that. It carries the swagger of inevitability. Besides, AI is learning so fast, how on earth can mere human beings, with our antique political tools, hope to keep up? That demand for a six-month moratorium on AI development sounds simple – until you reflect that it could take that long just to organise a meeting.Still, there are precedents for successful, collective human action. Scientists were researching cloning, until ethics laws stopped work on human replication in its tracks. Chemical weapons pose an existential risk to humanity but, however imperfectly, they, too, are controlled. Perhaps the most apt example is the one cited by Harari. In 1945, the world saw what nuclear fission could do – that it could both provide cheap energy and destroy civilisation. “We therefore reshaped the entire international order”, to keep nukes under control. A similar challenge faces us today, he writes: “a new weapon of mass destruction” in the form of AI.There are things governments can do. Besides a pause on development, they could impose restrictions on how much computing power the tech companies are allowed to use to train AI, how much data they can feed it. We could constrain the bounds of its knowledge. Rather than allowing it to suck up the entire internet – with no regard to the ownership rights of those who created human knowledge over millennia – we could withhold biotech or nuclear knowhow, or even the personal details of real people. Simplest of all, we could demand transparency from the AI companies – and from AI, insisting that any bot always reveals itself, that it cannot pretend to be human.This is yet another challenge to democracy as a system, a system that has been serially shaken in recent years. We’re still recovering from the financial crisis of 2008; we are struggling to deal with the climate emergency. And now there is this. It is daunting, no doubt. But we are still in charge of our fate. If we want it to stay that way, we have not a moment to waste.

Must be his enormous philanthropy Marina HydeGiving money away is hard, says Lauren Sánchez, who is currently touring Europe with Bezos on his 417ft yachtFri 26 May 2023 15.17 BSTLast modified on Fri 26 May 2023 20.53 BSTOne-click on a fascinator, readers, because there’s a mega-wedding in the offing. Congratulations to Mr Jeff Bezos, Amazon kajillionaire, and Ms Lauren Sánchez, bralette-wearing philanthropist/immense force of nature. Although news of the couple’s engagement seeped out this week after Lauren was spotted wearing a diamond ring in the south of France, Jeff has yet to release a formal announcement. So let’s just draft one for him: “Ladies and gents, she said Proceed to Checkout.”Now look, you already know Jeff. World’s third-richest man. Went to space. Looks like he should be appearing above a daytime TV caption reading “I make £40 a month as a Vin Diesel escort and my fiancee loves it!” But are you fully across Lauren? I’ll be honest: we haven’t met. But from the outside looking in, my nose pressed against the glass of Google Images, I simply cannot get enough of this Nietzschean superwoman, the final form of the East German silicon-doping programme, who has missile-titted her way into my consciousness and now captivates me twice weekly with her insouciance, her outfits, and her observations on just how difficult philanthropy is to do. Seriously: no one has ever thought harder about how to help poors while mooching round a Grand Prix enclosure with some kind of You Could Never Access All My Areas lanyard dangling from her belt loop. In some ways I don’t think I’ve felt this amused by a picaresque heroine since I saw a photo of Jennifer Arcuri biting the head off a fondant-icing Boris Johnson figurine, from a Boris Johnson cake she’d had made. Yes, customers who liked Jennifer also liked Lauren. Not so much a gal-about-town as a gal-about-planet.Anyway, the now-affianced Bezos and Sánchez are currently touring Europe on Jeff’s new yacht, Koru, a 417ft three-master/three-peniser that is the largest such vessel ever built. To put things into perspective, this yacht is so big it has its own yacht – a 246ft “support vessel”, which lugs around boring little things like the helicopter pad and reportedly some kind of personal submarine. And this week, for the first time, we saw Koru’s figurehead. Ships’ figureheads have traditionally come in various forms, of course: mermaids, Neptunes, angels – and now, Fox-News-anchor-in-transparent-singlet-with-erect-nipples. Suck on it, history! Our century is so the best. The Bezos yacht figurehead is fingering a large pendant necklace, and appears to be about to say something. “Draw me like one of your French girls”? Either way, the vast boat it adorns only recently left the shipyard, hopefully while some urchin child on the dock cackled: “Yeah but you’ll never be cool, will you, Bezos – YOU’LL NEVER BE COOL!”But will the Amazon boss ever, really, even be a genuine philanthropist? We do seem to be at the stage of human intellectual decay where anyone who is a multibillionaire is also automatically described as a “philanthropist”, when in many cases “misanthropist” would be more supported by the evidence. For instance, I’m forever seeing Dubai ruler Sheikh Mohammed described as a philanthropist. Is he the one who has at least two of his children missing/kidnapped at any given moment? Honestly, so what if he’s built a sanitation programme? I should hope so.Back to Lauren, though, who last year declared: “I’m immersing myself in philanthropy and strategic giving.” Which sounds a lot more fun than Amazon warehouse workers immersing themselves in strategic peeing-in-bottles. Yet it turns out this stuff is hard. “You want to give money away,” claimed Lauren. “You want to know that it’s helping people and it’s going to continue to help people, and that it’s going to the right places. You could give it not-strategically. You can just give it away! But, we take it seriously.” Mm. It feels like they’ve thought of everything except Amazon paying tax like normal businesses.The question of quite how much Bezos does truly want to give away is a thorny one, given he once said: “The only way that I can see to deploy this much financial resource is by converting my Amazon winnings into space travel.” Or as Lauren puts it: “Jeff has always told me, since I’ve known him, that he’s going to give the majority of his money away to philanthropy.” I hope you love the phoned-in generality of that “to philanthropy”.Even so, maybe “I’m going to give the majority of my money away to philanthropy” is the kind of thing you say to get laid in the early stages of a relationship. I’m suddenly reminded of Anne Hathaway’s former boyfriend, who told the movie star he was “the chief financial officer of the Vatican”. “My boyfriend is incredible,” Anne duly told the world. “But when it comes to his charity ... one of the most untouted aphrodisiacs in the world is charity work. Seriously, you want a girl to be impressed, vaccinate some kids, build a house.” Anne’s boyfriend would go on to serve a four-and-a-half-year jail term for fraud, with probably my favourite detail in the FBI files being that he had fake monsignor robes hanging in his and Anne’s wardrobe at their $37,500-a-month Trump Tower penthouse.But look, it’s all a journey. And we’re so, so lucky that Jeff’s still in the pretending-to-give-a-toss stage of things with Lauren, taking a veeeeery long run-up to a minuscule percentage of “strategic giving” on his half-a-billion-dollar boat. These fauxlanthropists may not give the world their taxes – but they do at least give us a few laughs. Strategically, or otherwise.

Photograph: Luca Bruno/APOpinionDroughtThe Guardian view on water politics in Europe: a new fault lineEditorialAs drought beacomes the norm, creative solutions must be found to deal with a new, parched realityFri 26 May 2023 18.30 BSTLast modified on Fri 26 May 2023 19.11 BSTIn April, Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, suggested that severe drought would become “one of the central political and territorial debates of our country in the coming years”. That stark warning surely applies to southern Europe as a whole, as the prospect of another summer crisis looms, following a disastrously dry winter.An absence of melting snow from the Alps has left Italy’s Po River as shallow as during last year’s searingly hot summer. In January and February, France recorded the highest number of rain-free days since records began, and water restrictions are in place in the Pyrénées-Orientales region. About 90% of mainland Portugal is suffering from drought, judged to be severe in one-fifth of the country. In Spain, from Catalonia to Andalucía, unseasonable heat has contributed to reservoirs drying up and a disastrous drop in olive oil production. By the middle of this month, southern Spain had received barely 30% of expected rainfall. As temperatures continue to rise, and Europe warms faster than the global average, drought across vast swathes of territory is simply becoming the norm.There are obvious moves that can be made to alleviate water shortages. A quarter of drinking water in Europe is lost because of leaky pipelines. In Italy – one of the worst offenders in this respect – a drought taskforce has been created to improve water infrastructure. In France, Emmanuel Macron has set a 10% water savings target for all sectors of the economy by 2030 and demanded far greater reuse of wastewater. New, low-energy desalination techniques will be key to guaranteeing future supplies of water for human consumption.There is, however, no foreseeable technical fix that will allow difficult decisions over an increasingly scarce resource to be evaded. The politics of a new, parched reality will be fraught and contested, particularly in relation to food production in transformed terrain. In France, plans for new reservoirs to irrigate farmland have led to violent clashes between police and environmental protesters, who argue that agricultural practices need to become less water-intensive.In Andalucía, regional proposals to legalise irrigation in part of the Doñana Natural Space – one the world’s most important wetlands – have become a wedge issue ahead of local elections this weekend. Vox, a far-right party which has made political gains through downplaying the severity of the climate emergency, has positioned itself as a champion of the strawberry farmers who would benefit from the plans. In Seville, thousands have demonstrated against the project, which has been condemned by both Madrid and the European Commission.Global heating will eventually force rural economies such as those in Andalucía to diversify to survive. They will require substantial assistance from both national governments and the European Union to do so. More needs to be done to help those who find themselves at the sharp end of an emerging crisis for agricultural production. An absence of proper economic support will breed dangerous resentment in regions that have traditionally prided themselves on supplying Europe’s fruit, vegetable and cereal needs.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Ms Understanding is an advice column for everyone on everyday issues around race
Fri 26 May 2023 16.00 BSTLast modified on Fri 26 May 2023 16.52 BSTDear Ms Understanding,I have my hair braided and I wear it braided to work. Every so often, I get a white person comment about it and ask to touch it. It’s uncomfortable for me but I usually politely oblige figuring it’s easier and faster than having the conversation that I’d like to. I’d like to know how to politely inform anyone that requests to touch my braided hair that this is not OK. I am Australian-African with dark pigmented skin and kinky hair.Thank youDear Black is Beautiful,I’ve been here before and it’s a terrible feeling.No matter how well-intentioned, questions from white people about African hair usually come from a place of racialized curiosity and are loaded with cultural assumptions about European hair representing the gold standard of how everyone’s hair should look and feel. Hair that is curly, kinky, short, too dark, etc, is weird, interesting or (my favourite) really cool.So, your discomfort is well founded. It is not appropriate for anyone at work to touch your hair. It’s a violation of your private space, and it’s unsanitary. It is also not appropriate for anyone in a professional setting to ask to touch your hair. As we know, there are many stereotypes about Black people and Black women in particular having “attitude” and being aggressive. So, it’s hard to say no, even if you are super-polite, without coming across as the aggressor.I’m a white man who wants to signal allyship with people of colour. What should I do?Read moreWhile your previous strategy of silence is a good strategy for avoiding conflict, it also places an enormous emotional burden on you, what is sometimes called the emotional tax.Despite this, please know that your feelings are valid. You aren’t being “sensitive” or unreasonable. If a man asked a woman if he could feel her breasts because he’d always been curious about how they feel, the office would be up in arms. Just as this request would be sexist, the request to touch your hair is racist.Sadly, sexism is far more easily recognised than racism in this society, so even though you’re right to challenge the behaviour, think carefully about how you respond. Until we eradicate racism, Black people almost always bear the negative consequences of racial confrontation.Often, white people argue that their curiosity is innocent, and they aren’t trying to be offensive. What the colleague who asks you about your hair doesn’t realise is that they are simply the latest in a very long line of people who have made that request over the years.The cumulative effect of all these questions, is to be reminded that you are not ‘normal’, to be told in some many words, that you are so fundamentally different from white people that the normal conventions of adult behaviour must be suspended, because your difference is so strange, so unimaginable, that it must be touched and physically experienced to be made real in their minds.Their request to touch your hair is another way of saying that your hair is so different, so strange, that it inspires the curiosity of a child. Because to be honest, the only people who have to touch something to believe it is real, are children who are encountering something for the first time. Since your colleagues are grownups, they don’t get a free pass.I’d pre-empt the entire situation by depersonalising it. Get in touch with your people and culture team, and talk to them about this as an issue of professionalism, diversity and inclusivity. Stick to the principles, and get the workplace to proactively let people know that touching you or even asking to touch you are not OK.Ideally the team includes this information in a wider set of activities like an anti-racism training, or a new set of policies.Then, the next time someone asks to touch your hair you can respond honestly and directly with something like, “No, you can’t touch my hair, it makes me uncomfortable, weren’t you at the training?”You can then ask them to get in touch with the relevant HR person. It’s an important redirect; a reminder someone in the organisation is being paid to enforce anti-racist laws and policies, and unless you work for the People and Culture team, that person is not you.Good luck!Ask us a questionWhatever your background, people have many questions around race and racism that can sometimes be difficult to ask. It might be how to handle racialised treatment in the workplace, how to best stand up for a friend or even what to do if you think you have upset someone. Sisonke Msimang can help you figure it out. Questions can be anonymous.

The HBO drama surrounding the Murdoch-esque family the Roys, fighting among themselves over who will become CEO of their media empire, has become a weekly lightning rod for debate in its final season (which ends on Monday). It’s normal to wake up on a Monday to a viral Twitter thread, Reddit or TikTok post putting forward a case for the morality of one of Succession’s main characters.The problem with these competing theories should be obvious to anyone who’s watched the show: every character on Succession is an irredeemably bad person.Succession isn’t bad – but it is overrated | Arwa MahdawiRead moreBe it Logan, the cruel and uncaring patriarch; any of his kids, each greedy, self-involved and violent in their own special way; or even the cast of secondary characters, all desperate sycophants operating entirely based on what will get them closer to power – the show is a conveyor belt of the worst human impulses. But it’s not just Succession: on TV today, highbrow dramas are filled with casts of unlikable characters. From Industry to The White Lotus, “prestige television” has become synonymous with knowing the people you’re watching are, on the whole, mostly bad.You can see why this is happening now. Shows full of these detestable characters – and in particular Succession – have come as a welcome relief for viewers who spent much of the last decade being preached to by soapy dramas with clear moral centres and/or obvious antiheroes (think: Orange Is the New Black, House of Cards, Master of None). The carefully drawn depravity baked into each of the Roys feels like an honest version of reality, without opportunistic sensationalism.While this trend has accelerated, a crevasse has opened up between the two types of most popular TV, with these prestige dramas where no one is a good person sitting at one end while the other is occupied by “nicecore” shows – like Ted Lasso or Abbott Elementary – where everyone is. The latter is full of peppy, saccharine characters who spend their time overcoming easy obstacles that teach viewers lessons about love and friendship they already know. These shows’ plotlines aren’t only unchallenging – with happy endings expected and baked in – they increasingly act as mini-moral infomercials, where characters give seemingly random monologues about consent, bullying and the importance of “feeling your feelings”.Jason Sudeikis in Ted Lasso, a ‘nicecore show’ Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamyFlawed good people are much harder to capture than near-perfect ones or shallow supervillains (it’s also easier said than done to create a balanced portrayal of good and bad without cloying sweetness or cliche). This isn’t to say there should be some plucky hero trying to stick up for the little guy on Succession, or two people in a perfectly well-adjusted relationship on The White Lotus – that would ruin these thoughtfully curated ensembles. But within the current landscape there’s little of this mixed morality on screen being done well. Audiences are often left choosing between the worst of humanity or a syrupy overdose of the best of it.What links The White Lotus to Tom Wolfe and the Sicilian good life?Read moreBut the new wave of apparently morality-free dramas do offer something that the alternative – shows about horrible people that ask you to simply judge them – would not. The increasingly saturated genre of shows and films “skewering” the rich adopted an instructive overtone where wealthy people are hammily portrayed as one-dimensional cartoon villains, such as in the now-canned Gossip Girl reboot or the recent Netflix film, Glass Onion, resulting in flat, predictable dramas. Viewers even appeared to prefer the second season of The White Lotus to the first after it dropped this tone from its writing, giving its characters greater moral complexity and less moralising (which yielded a far more interesting story).And perhaps this is partly why, even with the objective ugliness that defines each of the Roys and their nauseating counterparts, there is a pervasive belief among much of Succession’s audience that there still must be someone on the show for them to root for. Checking social media after each episode has become a game of seeing how far tens of thousands of viewers will go to argue that an abominable character – whether it’s a Nazi sympathiser, a narcissist, a killer, or some combination of all three – is merely flawed. This impulse is so insurmountable that many people who can clearly see the bad still find themselves grappling around these casts trying to sniff out a shred of good.Even if itself a flawed instinct, the persistence of this impulse is a large part of what makes Succession so successful. Its greatest trick is getting us to feel empathy for its characters in spite of their evident evil – characters who would happily ruin our lives in exchange for an inch of influence. It’s why, as the series ends, many viewers are already “pre-grieving” this show that managed to make a group of such bad people watchable – for some, even beloved. In its wake, we should expect to see casts like these more often, but we shouldn’t hold our breath for something that replicates its delicate, depraved balance.

Photograph: Apple TVOpinionDinosaursDavid Attenborough’s new series at last shows dinosaurs in all their feathered gloryDavid HoneThe prehistoric age has been stuck in a cultural rut since Jurassic Park. As a palaeontologist, I’m glad to see this era is overFri 26 May 2023 12.08 BSTLast modified on Fri 26 May 2023 13.20 BSTThe utterly extraordinary Prehistoric Planet has returned this week for a second season and, as a palaeontologist, I remain utterly enthralled by the whole thing. You might think I’d be spoiled for choice with the apparently unending parade of movies, video games and documentaries featuring animated dinosaurs, but this programme stands head and shoulders above anything else in terms of the accuracy of its animals and the naturalism they evoke.The jump from Ray Harryhausen classics such as One Million Years BC in the mid-1960s to Jurassic Park in 1993 was massive. Jurassic Park showed dinosaurs in a new way to vast audiences and ushered in a new wave of interest and representation, most notably in the BBC’s Walking with Dinosaurs series in 1999. However, 30 years on, most dinosaurs in mainstream film and TV still follow its look and feel, despite our scientific understanding of dinosaurs and their contemporaries having advanced enormously since then. Prehistoric Planet is as much, if not more, of a leap forward in showing dinosaurs as we think they really were.The most obvious progression is the number of dinosaurs being correctly shown with feathers and other filamentous coverings. Since the late 1990s, the fact that birds evolved from dinosaurs has become firmly established in palaeontology. Numerous fossils of fully feathered dinosaurs have been discovered, implying that many more bore feathers too. Seeing these animals rendered as they should be is very exciting. The details of the models, from the shape of the pupils, the size of the scales, the design of the colours, patterns and the curve of the claws, all speak to a depth of biological understanding not seen on screen before.Of course, some details are contentious and others unknowable, but the appearance and, more importantly, actions of the dinosaurs in these series are about as accurate as they could be. Where certain ideas are inevitably somewhat speculative, they are based on our current understanding. For example, in series one we see a herd of triceratops walking into caves to access some rare minerals needed in their diet. This is not something recorded in the fossil record, but we know that some modern animals – including elephants – do it, so it’s perfectly reasonable and likely that some dinosaurs did the same.For me, the key thing is not that these ancient animals are reproduced 100% accurately, but that they are brought to life realistically. Showing dinosaur mating rituals, parents nurturing their offspring and small animals challenging predators a dozen times their size is new, or very rare – and yet these are behaviours that are completely normal for animals. On top of this, it’s easy to spot various references to real scientific papers on the behaviour, appearance, actions and ecology of dinosaurs and other animals in every episode. There might necessarily be some extrapolation and filling in to account for the gaps in the fossil record, but this compelling television is clearly based on real research.And Prehistoric Planet doesn’t just show the inevitable gory scenes, such as a fight to the death between a tyrannosaurus and triceratops; it also gives the animals (and viewers) a chance to breathe and take in the view, whether it’s a swamp, desert or ice field (not just another procession of jungles). Dinosaurs, pterosaurs, plesiosaurs and other ancient animals are not monsters or mythical creatures, but were real (if very odd by today’s standards) living, breathing and behaving creatures interacting in thriving ecosystems.And so it is welcome to see other animals getting their due alongside these great reptiles. The inclusion of frogs, snakes, birds, mammals and ammonites, all set into coherent and realistic environments, makes the programme stand out even more. Although tyrannosaurus, velociraptor and some other household names appear, it’s extremely refreshing to see animals that few people have heard of, from alcione to zalmoxes, as well as numerous animals and landscapes that have never been shown before.We’re finding out more about dinosaurs than ever – but their sex lives still elude us | Dave HoneRead moreScience usually moves on incrementally, and occasionally in major jumps, but public perceptions tend to lag behind. It takes time for new ideas to become mainstream and then to appear on screen. Prehistoric Planet’s real achievement is not just bringing these animals to life, but doing so at the cutting edge of scientific discovery. It shows the public what palaeontologists believe these animals were really like, not just a slightly polished version of what scriptwriters imagine they were.As someone who is actively engaged in research into the biology of dinosaurs and pterosaurs, and in outreach and communication to the public about these animals, I find Prehistoric Planet to be a shining example of bringing them to life. The new series should be appreciated not just for its beautiful cinematography and Attenborough’s narration, but as a bleeding-edge representation of the science of the extinct.

Composite: Guardian DesignPremier LeagueWhy Premier League trio are in this mess and what relegation could doBefore the fate of Everton, Leicester and Leeds is decided on the final day we analyse each club’s predicamentAndy Hunter, Ben Fisher and Louise TaylorFri 26 May 2023 19.00 BSTEverton Pts 33 (GD -24), Bournemouth (h)Why are they in this mess? Farhad Moshiri, Everton’s billionaire owner, has made a succession of erratic and ill-judged decisions since buying into the club seven years ago, starting with retaining members of a board that had failed to keep pace with its competitors. Everton’s descent has since accelerated with dreadful recruitment, mismanagement and incoherent strategy hallmarks of the Moshiri era. The owner’s generosity cannot be faulted – about £700m has been spent on transfers and the interminable stadium problem has almost been resolved, with an impressive new home under construction at Bramley Moore dock – but he has spent without a plan or patience. Sean Dyche is Everton’s eighth permanent manager in seven years, there have been three directors of football and huge financial losses have inevitably caught up with them. The club went into the season without an established goalscorer – with Dominic Calvert-Lewin injured and Richarlison sold – and compounded that grievous error by failing to make a January signing. They have paid a price that everyone else saw coming.What impact would relegation have? Moshiri has signed an exclusivity agreement with the American investment firm MSP Sports Capital in his search for funds to complete Everton’s new stadium on the banks of the River Mersey. Whether it would proceed with a deal for a club in the Championship, at least on Moshiri’s current terms, is open to question. Yet relegation would bring even greater repercussions. Everton have posted combined losses for the past three financial years of £305.5m and are under investigation for an alleged breach of the Premier League’s profit and sustainability rules, which they deny. The club also owes £150m to Rights & Media Funding Limited. Its “ability to continue as a going concern” will be in “significant doubt” in the event of relegation, according to Everton’s own auditors. There would be a fire sale of playing assets such as Jordan Pickford and Amadou Onana, followed by a potentially catastrophic financial downturn. AHJordan Pickford, here saving from Aston Villa’s Ollie Watkins, would be expected to leave Everton in the event of relegation. Photograph: Lewis Storey/Getty ImagesLeicester Pts 31 (GD -18),West Ham (h)Why are they in this mess? Until Monday at St James’ Park Leicester were the only team in Europe’s top five leagues to not have recorded a clean sheet since November. That statistic is indicative of a major factor in their slide – the porousness of their defence – but there are others. Brendan Rodgers gave Danny Ward the chance to establish himself as a first-choice Premier League goalkeeper after Kasper Schmeichel’s departure but Ward struggled and his replacement, Daniel Iversen, has also been unconvincing. Last summer’s failure to reinvigorate the squad because of financial constraints meant they were left behind by rivals and too many important players, such as Wilfried Ndidi and Jamie Vardy, have not hit previous heights. Poor recruitment in the last few windows has also caught up with them. This summer will see a huge turnover of players regardless of the division they are playing in next season.Quick GuideThe final-day relegation permutationsShowEverton Points 33 Goal difference -24 Goals scored 33 Bournemouth, homeA win guarantees survival. A draw will be enough if Leicester fail to win and Leeds do not win by at least three goals. A defeat will suffice if Leicester and Leeds fail to win. Leicester Points 31 Goal difference -18 Goals scored 49West Ham, homeNeed a victory to have hope of avoiding relegation.

If Leicester then fail to win and Everton lose, Leeds will be safe. If Leicester fail to win and Everton draw, Leeds will survive if they beat Spurs by three or more goals.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.What impact would relegation have? Leicester would likely lose the ability to attract a favoured manager such as Graham Potter and so the interim manager, Dean Smith, could be regarded as a sensible permanent appointment. The squad would have their wages slashed by up to 50% but high earners such as James Maddison and Harvey Barnes are set to depart regardless of whether Leicester stay up, and players such as the club captain Jonny Evans, midfielder Youri Tielemans and defender Caglar Soyuncu are out of contract. Leicester reported a club-record pre-tax loss of £92.5m for 2021-22 but much of that was owing to the failure to sell an asset for significant profit in the way they previously sold Wesley Fofana, Ben Chilwell and Harry Maguire. The commitment of Leicester’s owner, King Power International Group, to the club – and community – cannot be doubted. In February Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha, the chairman, wiped out £194m of debt.

The obsession with sticking to Bielsa’s system – or at least a version of it – prompted the former director of football Victor Orta to replace the Argentinian with Jesse Marsch last year. The only problem was that Marsch’s love of pressing was not matched by his ability to win Premier League matches. Leeds, though, delayed sacking the American until February and Javi Gracia, his extremely interim successor, struggled to turn things round before Sam Allardyce’s installation for the concluding four games. If neither Gracia nor, especially, Allardyce has had enough time to repair one of the league’s most porous defences, the club’s decision to make the inexperienced French forward Georginio Rutter their record £35m signing in January remains extremely puzzling. He may be promising but he is far from ready for first-team English top-tier football. That money could have been much better spent.What impact would relegation have? The long-mooted full takeover by the San Francisco-based 49er Enterprises would be in jeopardy. Although, in principle, some – although not all – investors in the 49er Enterprises group remain keen to buy in the event of relegation, they would want Leeds for about £150m rather than the £400m agreed with the majority owner, Andrea Radrizzani. There are doubts as to whether a satisfactory compromise could be reached. Should the takeover fall through, the much-needed redevelopment of the extremely dated Elland Road would again be on the back burner. If it helps that many players have relegation clauses involving 60% wage cuts in the event of relegation, some key personnel including Illan Meslier, Robin Koch and Luis Sinisterra would almost certainly be sold. Although Leeds have indicated a desire to keep Tyler Adams and Wilfried Gnonto, the US midfielder is much admired by Newcastle and the Italy forward is widely coveted. Championship football may limit the choice of a longer-term manager and possibly deter boardroom favourites, notably Rodgers and Potter.

I think it’s going to be exciting to watch, horrible to do.”Now only two stages from final victory in Rome, he must sustain his advantage in the 18.6km race against the clock on Monte Lussari, a horrendously steep former mule track in north-eastern Italy’s Julian Alps. The omens for Thomas, however, are good. Of his closest rivals, Thomas was the best performer in the Giro’s last time trial, on stage nine, in which he distanced Roglic by 16sec and Almeida by more than half a minute.Also in his favour is Roglic’s infamous collapse in the 2020 Tour de France mountain time trial on a similar climb, to La Planche des Belles Filles, before which he had looked assured of final victory.Thomas will not be relying on the Slovenian’s past traumas, though, and will know Monte Lussari’s gradients are no place for complacency.The 37-year-old Welshman has been the most consistent rider over the Giro’s three weeks.

In the 2022 Tour de France he placed third, the sole rider to finish within 10 minutes of the winner, Jonas Vingegaard, and the runner-up, Tadej Pogacar.Asked last summer if, before the race, his team had shared his level of belief, he replied: “I don’t think so. It’s all talk about the younger generation now.”After Thomas’s third place in Paris, even Sir Dave Brailsford admitted that the Ineos Grenadiers management had underestimated Thomas. “If I was in his shoes, I’d have a wry smile on my face, let’s face it,” the team principal said.Even during this Giro, when he moved into the race lead, Thomas has his doubters. “It’s the story of my career, proving people wrong. Everyone always doubts me,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to The RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

His legs are always hurting. Then he wins a stage.”Monte Lussari, however, is no place for theatrics, and Thomas’s 26sec margin on the Slovenian should be enough to clinch overall success.TopicsGiro d'ItaliaCyclingGeraint ThomasPrimoz RoglicTeam IneosnewsReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedFootballCricketRugby unionTennisCyclingF1GolfUS sportsNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Composite: Getty ImagesCarlos Alcaraz‘This boy was born to be No 1’: the making of Carlos AlcarazThose who watched his formative years in a Murcian village reveal how the world No 1 emerged from the grounds of Tiro de PichónTumaini CarayolFri 26 May 2023 19.00 BSTLast modified on Fri 26 May 2023 20.36 BSTIn the south-eastern corner of El Palmar, a village in south-eastern Spain, the Real Sociedad Club de Campo sits in the mountains overlooking the Murcia region’s eponymous capital city. Exactly 100 years ago, the club was founded solely as a hunters’ society, where those of privileged backgrounds would convene to shoot pigeons out of the sky. Its evolution into a handsome private tennis club has unexpectedly positioned it as the place where many people first glimpsed the player who could be the future of the men’s game.It was on the grounds of Tiro de Pichón (Pigeon Strike), as the club is still colloquially known as today, where many people saw Carlos Alcaraz and left with the belief that they had seen something special.“He began to play with his dad, and one day [his father] asked me to watch him. This kid, at four, five years old, was spectacular,” says Kiko Navarro, who was coached there by Alcaraz’s father, Carlos Sr, in his youth before eventually becoming one of Alcaraz Jr’s early coaches.Holger Rune: ‘I think if everybody was the same, it would be a bit boring’Read more“I knew from very young that he was incredible,” Navarro says. “I’m not going to say that I was thinking he was going to be world No 1 but I knew that I had a really good and different player on my hands.”Alfredo Sarria is a close friend and longtime business partner of Carlos Sr, whom he likens to a brother, and the pair run the Carlos Alcaraz Academy together at Tiro de Pichón. After first seeing a four-year-old Alcaraz in action while playing padel with his brother, Álvaro, Sarria was also enthused by his potential.“When he was young you saw that he was very good, that he was going to be a champion,” Sarria says. “But hey, you say it with a ‘small mouth’ – you say it without completely believing everything you say.”Alcaraz’s roots are entrenched in the club, which has 13 tennis courts and four padel courts as well as a swimming pool, a gym, a basketball court and a football pitch. His grandfather, also Carlos, learned how to play tennis there and he eventually became a prominent member, helping to mould it into the modern sporting club it is today.A young Carlos Alcaraz and his former coach Kiko Navarro. Photograph: Courtesy of Kiko NavarroHis passion for tennis was passed down to Alcaraz’s father, who took the dream forward by competing at a high level within Spain. Still, he did not have the funds to pursue a serious professional career. He eventually became a tennis coach and administrator in tennis and padel.It took three generations in the Alcaraz lineage for a true breakthrough but the wait has been worthwhile. Alcaraz has arrived at the French Open, which starts on Sunday, as the world No 1 and one of the tournament favourites after a historic 2022 that included him becoming a grand slam champion at the US Open and the ATP’s first ever teenage No 1 at 19.Around the club, various members have vivid memories of witnessing a passionate young Carlitos (“Little Carlo”), as he is widely known, in his earliest days. Sarria recalls a time when he arrived at the club for a meeting with Alcaraz’s father: “I went to look for Carlos Sr and there I find Carlitos watching a game between grandparents by the fence on court three,” he says, laughing. “He knew how they were faring, he told them the mistakes they were making: ‘You have to serve here.’ He has a passion for tennis.”At a time when modern tennis has become dominated by attritional rallies from the baseline, one of the defining aspects of Alcaraz’s success is the way he has achieved it. He burst into the sport playing dynamic, creative all-court tennis, demolishing forehands, smothering opponents with an unending stream of drop shots and constantly looking to flit forward to the net.“Just as you see him hit 20 drop shots per match today, he hit them at 13 years old,” says David Ayuela, who captained the Spanish Junior Davis Cup team during Alcaraz’s time in it. “What’s more, when he was 13, I remember that there were people who said: ‘Oof, this boy, a lot of drop shots. So many drop shots. We’ll see when he grows up and becomes a professional.’ This is exactly the same game [he plays now].”All that he trained, he also did in matches. For him it was natural, even aged eight, to spend half a match at the netAlfredo SarriaThe variety in Alcaraz’s game is courtesy of his very first coach, his father, who taught him sound technique on each shot. But Sarria notes that all players at the academy are taught in the same way. The difference between Alcaraz and many of his peers was his willingness to implement them in matches, which allowed him to quickly become comfortable with his arsenal of shots.“Carlos has always had the virtue from the beginning that all that he trained, he also did it in matches,” says Sarria. “So for him it was natural, even at eight years old, to spend half a match at the net. No eight-year-old spends half a match approaching the net because they know they’re going to get lobbed and passed.”His mastery of variety and touch is also directly related to his precocity. Alcaraz’s uncle, Tomás, often tells the story of when he took him to his first tournament at five years old. Alcaraz competed against an opponent two to three years his elder, and much taller. They played with adult balls rather than the depressurised balls normally reserved for players his age.Each time the ball bounced, it would fly over Alcaraz’s head. After losing the first set easily, at five he still had the wherewithal to adapt: “Instead of letting it bounce, he moved into the forecourt and volleyed every shot, hitting the ball without letting it bounce,” says Sarria. “And he almost won the match because he had the skill [and] he had the resources to say: ‘Well, I can’t win like this, I’m going to win this other way.’”Carlos Alcaraz won the US Open last year – only his second participation in the tournament. Photograph: Mike Segar/ReutersSince he emerged on the ATP Tour, Alcaraz has constantly stressed the necessity of competing with a smile on his face. When a smile does not easily come to him in the heat of battle, even when he is losing, it is an indication of overwhelming nerves. His on-court demeanour is unusual for a player who competes so fiercely.This was not always the case. As a child, Alcaraz’s temper was infamous. He threw rackets in anger, he burst into tears and refused to leave the court after losses. “The truth is that Carlos had a strong personality, a big temper,” says Navarro. “He did not like to lose at all. When we were travelling around the world and he lost a match, you had to leave him for a while as he would cry. He was a bad loser.”In Rome earlier this month, Alcaraz reminisced on his old ways with a smile: “When I was younger, I was a totally different person,” he said, laughing. “Probably I didn’t enjoy it as I’m enjoying right now. I was always mad, throwing the racket, complaining a lot. It was different. I started to calm myself, control my emotions. I started to enjoy playing tennis, enjoy a lot on the court.”A few days into his campaign in Rome, Alcaraz suffered one of his worst ever losses, losing to the world No 135, Fabian Marozsan. It was almost as striking to see him eagerly answering questions in his press conference with a smile on his face and heaping praise on his Hungarian opponent. Even when he would rage after defeats as a child, he did not allow his frustration to linger for too long.“There have been times when he stayed on the court and he didn’t want to get off because he didn’t want to lose,” says Sarria. “But it is also true that after 10 minutes, he had forgotten. Always. He was very pissed off, he put on a show, but after 10 minutes he had a smile on his face and had forgotten about the game.”While many aspects of the 20-year-old’s game remain technically identical to when he was younger, there have been notable changes, including his serve and backhand. There was enough concern about the progress of Alcaraz’s backhand that there were even discussions within his camp about switching to a single-handed backhand.Despite Alcaraz striking the single-hander well, Navarro and the rest of his team were ultimately against the change. Such episodes were reflective of his adaptability and the ease with which he learned new skills.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to The RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was very easy to change it. If you say: ‘Carlitos, hit with one hand,’ he will hit with one hand. This boy was born to be a tennis player, to be No 1,” says Navarro.The Junior Davis Cup brings together the best players aged 16 and under in the international team competition. In 2018, the tournament was held in Budapest, with Spain and France meeting in the final.After France took the first singles rubber, Alcaraz, a year younger than his competition, stepped up against Harold Mayot, a future junior No 1, requiring a win to keep their chances alive. Instead, he was overcome by nerves and he could not play freely. Alcaraz trailed 6-3, 5-3 and 30-40 as the match appeared to be slipping away.“It was match point and gold medal point for France,” says Ayuela. “But Carlos Alcaraz saved it, and incredibly, he won the match.”He returned shortly afterwards to win the decisive doubles rubber alongside his good friend Pablo Llamas. For those present, it was another of those striking indicators of his enormous potential.After the early days of building his game and committing to the prospect of achieving something in the sport, one of the decisive moments of Alcaraz’s career occurred as his family tried to plan his first trip abroad for a world championship under-10s competition in Pula, Croatia.The family, which includes his mother, Virginia, and three brothers, Álvaro, Jaime and Sergio, did not have the financial resources to fund an expensive tennis career. As they tried to seek out sponsors, Navarro decided to ask for financial help from a good friend who worked at Postres Reina, a local confectionery company in Murcia. He agreed to fund the trip.An image of Carlos Alcaraz adorns another wall in Murcia. Photograph: Tumaini Carayol“It ended up being expensive because we were four people – Carlitos’s uncle, the son of the sponsor, Carlitos and I,” says Navarro, laughing. “In the end, he reached the final against another Spaniard, Daniel Rincón. It was a really nice foundation, Carlos remembers it well. It was a really nice trip in Croatia.”After the first successful trip, Postres Reina agreed to fund his subsequent trips as he began to travel around Spain and Europe for competitions. The company played an essential role in Alcaraz’s career and remains his sponsor today.“When you have a large family or you have four children, you don’t want anyone to lack,” says Sarria. “You can’t invest everything in one and not the others. So Reina helped a lot and that without a doubt is one of the legs of the table for Carlos to get to where he is.”As a person who cherishes closeness with his friends and family, even his success and progress were not always easy to swallow. Eventually, Alcaraz became too good for the players he had grown up playing with. A particularly difficult period came when he had to stop playing with his friend and lifelong training partner, Pedro Cobacho.Sarria says: “There have been moments in which Carlos said: ‘Why isn’t this kid going to train with me any more?’ Well, he doesn’t have your level. ‘But he’s my friend. Why? No training if I am training without my friend.’ But he can’t track down your shots.”The Alcaraz family receives a lot of credit from their community for their role in nurturing the player and ensuring that he always felt the love and affection around him. “Tennis is an individual sport, no?” says Sarria. “But Carlos Sr has always tried to make it look more like a team sport, in the sense of that support. In the end, the sorrows are less sorrowful and the joys are shared.”That feeling of community was particularly tested when Alcaraz made another important decision as he moved to Villena, just over an hour away by car, to train at Juan Carlos Ferrero’s Equelite Sport Academy. In time Ferrero, a former world No 1 and the 2003 French Open champion, took over as his coach, using his knowledge of the professional game to help guide Alcaraz to the top.Alcaraz initially moved to Villena with Navarro and they spent two years living together until their coaching partnership came to an end. Even though he returned home on the weekends, it wasn’t an easy adjustment for Alcaraz, who missed his friends and family. “It’s difficult to take Carlitos out of Murcia,” Navarro says.A fan holds up a sign for Carlos Alcaraz at Indian Wells in March. Photograph: Mark J Terrill/APEven now, Alcaraz returns home often. Just before he sat down to talk, Sarria received a message from Alcaraz’s team asking him to book a court for the world No 1 at the club as he returned for a couple of days before heading to Roland Garros.The club and academy are booming, partly due to the global growth in tennis participation since the early days of the pandemic, the sleek facilities and the crisp mountain air, but also because new members of the academy have been attracted by the hope of replicating Alcaraz’s success. In the clubhouse, as his kids played on the football pitch outside, a German father of tennis-playing children keenly explained that he was in the process of permanently relocating his family from the Rafa Nadal Academy in Mallorca to El Palmar.The town has also seen some visual changes. As you enter the village from the motorway that connects it with the city of Murcia, the very first image upon entering El Palmar is an enormous mural of Alcaraz striking a backhand. It is a permanent reminder of the talented, hard-working village kid who has not forgotten the warm, tight-knit community that shaped him.TopicsCarlos AlcarazFrench Open 2023French OpenTennisfeaturesReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedFootballCricketRugby unionTennisCyclingF1GolfUS sportsNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Perhaps it was fated that it would be the streets of Monte Carlo hosting the team’s very public roll of the dice as they attempt to turn around this season and future endeavours. The stakes could not be higher.At the start of the year there was optimism at the team. By the time the flag fell on the first race in Bahrain it had been laid waste. Way off the pace of the dominant Red Bull, whose successful interpretation of the 2022 regulation changes has delivered a car unbeaten this year, Mercedes’ team principal Toto Wolff’s blunt, honest reaction was indicative of how hard reality had hit.Lewis Hamilton insists he will stay at Mercedes and denies Ferrari approachRead moreSomewhat ashen-faced, he conceded they had followed the wrong design concept and would begin immediately on adopting a new philosophy to turn round their fortunes. The fruits of the process hit the track in Monaco this weekend in the “B-spec” of the Mercedes W14.At the last round in Miami Lewis Hamilton said he was “counting the days” until the new model appeared but as he winds his way through Casino Square this weekend the seven-time champion does not believe that altering course mid-stream is a gamble.“Last year we were a little bit lost in terms of how to fix the issue that we had,” he said in Monaco. “I feel like the team now have a north star, they know exactly where they need to go and we’re working on how to get there.”Very cautious optimism was the reaction after the car’s first outing in practice at Monaco. Hamilton took third place in FP1, behind Carlos Sainz and Fernando Alonso. While in the afternoon running, Hamilton was in sixth place with Max Verstappen topping the timesheets.The British driver however considered it a reasonable opening for the new car. “It’s not the place to ultimately test an upgrade but the car was generally feeling good,” he said. “Ultimately it’s a bit of a shame we weren’t as close as I hoped at the end of the session but definitely felt the improvements. We’ve just got to keep chipping away at it. Hopefully this gives us a platform to work on moving forwards.”The changes are rooted in the aerodynamic philosophy of the car and have been focused on dropping the slim, “zero-sidepod” concept the team had adopted, alongside revisions to the front suspension and the floor. Primarily the intent is to make a more stable platform that performs consistently as expected, most importantly by improving downforce and grip by being able to run lower to the track and better channeling the airflow under the car as Red Bull have managed in mastering the ground-effect aero of the new regulations.Toto Wolff conceded Mercedes followed the wrong concept and the team are adopting a new philosophy. Photograph: Mark Thompson/Getty ImagesIt should be noted that Mercedes cannot simply copy Red Bull, the aerodynamics are too complex and rarefied to do so without employing a correct underlying design philosophy. To that longer-term end they have not wasted time with the leadership team reshuffled and James Allison, the architect of the championship-winning Mercedes cars of 2018 to 2020 returning to replace Mike Elliott as technical director.Yet his task is of a different scope now, with time pressure, a budget cap and limitations of aspects such as the gearbox design already fixed and homologated for the season to deal with. Expectations are understandably being managed. Wolff has warned not to expect a silver bullet, cautiously anticipating “the first step in a new development direction”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to The RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Mercedes trackside engineering director, Andrew Shovlin, has emphasised they are most interested in confirmation that they are at least on the right track.“We are not just looking to bring a lap time update,” he said. “We are looking to head off in a different development direction. One that we think gives us a better chance in the long term of being able to challenge for race wins and world championships.”There are caveats too in Monaco, which is far from ideal to assess the goal. The new car was intended to make its debut at the last round in Imola, a traditional circuit but with the race there cancelled, Monaco it is. Monte Carlo’s street circuit requires maximum downforce, with little concern for drag, while the setup is compromised to compensate for the bumps and camber of the track, meaning a higher ride height, which is not the direction Mercedes is interested in investigating with their new design.Hamilton conceded that they might have to wait until the next round in Spain to really gauge the performance but he knows, as do Mercedes, that as a driver with an absolutely innate feel for a car he will understand instinctively whether there are legs in the great leap forward.Red Bull are gone but realistically Mercedes will be targeting surpassing Aston Martin and Ferrari this season to build the platform to compete again for the title in 2024. At Monaco they will play their hand.TopicsMercedes GPFormula OneLewis HamiltonMotor sportfeaturesReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedFootballCricketRugby unionTennisCyclingF1GolfUS sportsNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The team bus will then circle one and a half times around Borsigplatz, the large roundabout in the north of Dortmund, before winding the four kilometres through the centre of town, where anything from 200,000 to 500,000 fans are expected to line the streets in celebration.All week, as Dortmund’s players and staff have driven around the city going about their business, they will have noticed the barriers and road signs going up. They have felt their phone glow white-hot with ticket demands. They may even have heard the mayor of Dortmund declare: “We’re assuming the team won’t let it slip on Saturday.” And yet they will also know that all this is still contingent on one thing: the 90 minutes of football that could break the drought, or break them instead.Whatever comes next, Bayern Munich must rip it up and start again | Andy BrassellRead moreThe deed is almost done. Victory at home against ninth-placed Mainz on Saturday afternoon would bring the curtain down on Bayern Munich’s decade of dominance. Victory against Mainz would bring the Bundesliga shield back to North Rhine-Westphalia for the first time since 2012, when Jürgen Klopp was young and Robert Lewandowski was up front and every kid with a copy of Fifa wanted to play as Borussia Dortmund.Bayern, two points behind but with a vastly superior goal difference, must go to Köln, win and hope. Nothing but a win will be good enough for Bayern; in which case nothing but a win will be good enough for Dortmund. And in Bavaria they retain strong memories of the great escape of 2000, when they began the final day three points behind but sneaked in after Bayer Leverkusen lost at Unterhaching.And in one sense it would be the most Bayern of outcomes if even in this most chastening of seasons they were to find some way to win. Likewise it would be the most Dortmund of outcomes if, presented with the championship on a platter, they found some way of spurning it again. But there have been plenty of opportunities for Dortmund to choke during the run-in. Instead, they have steadily hacked away at the nine-point lead Bayern enjoyed over them at the turn of the year, with an assurance and a maturity that have not always been their tendency.Hasan Salihamidzic (middle row centre) and Oliver Kahn (middle row right) are likely to bear the brunt if Bayern fail to win the title. Photograph: Matthias Hangst/Getty ImagesThat we even reached this point is a surprise. Even as Bayern chugged their way through the spring, dropping points, sacking Julian Nagelsmann, there seemed to be a widespread assumption that the old muscle memory would eventually see them through, that their rivals would ultimately drop too many points. “Dortmund are almost too stupid to become German champions,” the president of Bavaria, Markus Söder, said in April.Instead it was Bayern, title still in their grasp, who crumbled under the pressure at home to Leipzig last weekend. Their record under their new coach, Thomas Tuchel, reads five wins, two draws and four defeats, a run that could see three trophies disappear in the space of two months. “We’ve messed up often enough, it’s our own fault,” Tuchel said this week. And while Tuchel is safe for now, the chief executive, Oliver Kahn, and sporting director, Hasan Salihamidzic, hover nervously over the trap door.Paradoxically, this has not been a vintage Dortmund season either. They started poorly, and will end with fewer points than in 2016 and 2019, when they finished second. But if they owe their opportunity more to Bayern weakness, it has been seized with elan. The attacking trio of Sébastien Haller, Karim Adeyemi and Donyell Malen have been irresistible in recent weeks. Gio Reyna has chipped in with vital goals. Julian Brandt and Jude Bellingham have run the show from midfield. Meanwhile at the back they have relied on the experience of Niklas Süle and Mats Hummels – the only survivor of Dortmund’s last title win.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Football DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Photograph: Adam Pretty/Getty ImagesThis is perhaps the sharpest point of contrast with previous contenders. The signings of Haller and Süle last summer were a recognition that Dortmund’s famed youth model required a little rebalancing. And so alongside bankable young stars such as Bellingham, Reyna and Adeyemi are older heads such as Süle and Hummels, Emre Can and Thomas Meunier, Haller and Raphaël Guerreiro, all of whom have won titles elsewhere. That little core of knowledge and expertise has been crucial. For a young player, Dortmund has long been where you go to grow. Now, the club hopes, it can also be a place where you win.“It shows that we do not just develop players, produce high potential, but we can also win trophies,” said the sporting director, Sebastian Kehl. “The capacity to win titles is massively important to bring players to Dortmund in the future, to convince their families and agents. We want to be ambitious. But at some point you have to deliver.”A decade after these two clubs contested a brilliant Champions League final, German football became a one-party state. Bayern won the past 10 Bundesligas in a row and everyone else’s job was to applaud. And so what’s at stake here is not so much a title as an idea. Can you have a vibrant league and a proper title race at the same time? Can you keep selling players and get stronger? And in the money-run modern game, can giants ever truly be toppled? By 12.09pm on Sunday, we’ll have more than a faint idea of the answers.TopicsBundesligaBorussia DortmundBayern MunichEuropean club footballfeaturesReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedFootballLive scoresTablesFixturesResultsCompetitionsClubsNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Not so long ago Luton Town and Coventry City, clubs with a rich tapestry of top-flight moments, were black and blue – it is only five years since they were lining up against each other in League Two – but now they are on the verge of the bells and whistles of the Premier League.It is the reason the Coventry manager, Mark Robins, described Saturday’s final at Wembley one for the romantics. Coventry spent 34 years in the top tier before being relegated in 2001. Luton were relegated in 1992 after a 10-year stay. Coventry lifted the FA Cup 1987 and Luton the League Cup the following year. Mick Harford was part of that Luton team in 1988. The club’s former manager, assistant manager and now chief recruitment officer says Luton’s story, from stomaching a 30-point deduction that brought relegation to non-league in 2009 to being this close to the big time, is fit for a film. But who would play Harford? “Who’s got a broken nose and dodgy knees?” he says, smiling. “It’s got to be Brad Pitt, hasn’t it?”Being a Coventry fan used to mean chaos and hurt – now it’s time to celebrate | Jonny WeeksRead moreToo many Championship clubs have bet the ranch and lost, with Derby arguably best qualified to tell the cautionary tale. Others, such as Aston Villa, who won promotion via Wembley four years ago, have got away with it over the years. One chief executive recently declared the division a hellhole, so bleak is its financial picture. Some League One clubs have bigger budgets than Coventry and Luton. Both of their most recent starting lineups were assembled at a cost of little more than £2m, with clever use of the free agent and loan market. Several Championship clubs spent more on agent fees alone from February 2022 to January 2023. “You have to try to remain competitive without killing the club,” Robins says.Both clubs have been smart in terms of recruitment, with data, due diligence and character references key steps in the scouting process. “They look into you as a person and they really do leave no stone unturned,” says Carlton Morris, who became Luton’s record signing last summer after they paid an initial £1.3m to buy the striker from Barnsley. “I’ve been in situations where there can be bad eggs in dressing rooms and it doesn’t take much for the vibe and the energy to change. It’s like a delicate ecosystem, a changing room. It’s important to keep it healthy.”Luton attack Coventry in what turned out to be a warmup for the Championship playoff final at Wembley. Photograph: Mark Thompson/Getty ImagesLuton, who reached the playoff semi-finals last season, finished third this campaign despite operating with a bottom-three budget. Coventry have not spent much more. “Us and Coventry are proof that you can succeed in our pyramid even if you don’t risk your club,” says Kevin Harper of the Luton Town Supporters’ Trust. “I think that is a massive message that everyone, particularly in the Championship where people are spending obscene amounts chasing the dream, could learn from. We are a working-class town and we know the value of a pound coin. The club live up to that.”Both teams have shown they are capable of absorbing disruption. Coventry have been plagued by off-field problems. Luton lost last season’s player of the season, Kal Naismith, to Bristol City last summer and their manager, Nathan Jones, to Southampton in November. Rob Edwards, sacked by their rivals Watford, succeeded Jones and has pushed Luton on again. “Someone said to me: ‘You’ve got the winning formula,’” Edwards says. “I’ll tell you what it is: it’s good people; I’m around good people. You have to have consistency, you’ve got to recruit well, you’ve got to be savvy. Know what you are and try to be good at it and that’s what we have done really well.”Quick GuideThe £4.7m final: predicted XIs and what they costShowLuton Town (3-5-2)Ethan Horvath, 27, loan, from Nottingham ForestGabriel Osho, 24, free, ReadingTom Lockyer, 28, free, CharltonAmari’i Bell, 29, free, BlackburnCody Drameh, 21,  loan, LeedsMarvelous Nakamba, 29, loan, Aston VillaPelly Ruddock Mpanzu, 30, free, West HamJordan Clark, 29, free, Accrington Alfie Doughty, 23, £500,000, Stoke Carlton Morris, 27, £1.3m, BarnsleyElijah Adebayo, 25, £250,000, WalsallTotal: £2.05mCoventry City (3-4-1-1)Ben Wilson, 30, free, from BradfordKyle McFadzean, 36, free, Burton Callum Doyle, 20, loan, Manchester CityLuke McNally, 23, loan, Burnley Jake Bidwell, 30, free, SwanseaBrooke Norton-Cuffy, 19, loan, ArsenalLiam Kelly, 33, free, from Leyton OrientGustavo Hamer, 25, £1.3m, PEC ZwolleJamie Allen, 28, £150,000, Burton Viktor Gyökeres, 24, £900,000, BrightonBen Sheaf, 25, £300,000, ArsenalTotal: £2.65mWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Luton and Coventry playing out the final should humble division rivals with bigger pockets. “If you go back 31 years when the Premier League was formed, we voted for it to go ahead but got relegated that season and never set foot in the place,” Harper says. “In the back of the mind there has always been that sense of: ‘We helped to create this, but we’ve never had a slice of the pie.’ Just to have one season in the Premier League would be massive.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Football DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Luton last visited in 2012 for the Conference playoff final, which they lost to York City, Coventry in 2018, when they clinched promotion from League Two. But this time the game is worth so much more. Gary Sweet, the Luton chief executive, cites the £500m boost to Brighton’s economy since that club’s promotion in 2017. This week the tributaries of Kenilworth Road were abuzz with excitement and nervous energy. “Crazy busy, but good busy, exciting busy,” says a member of ticket-office staff. “We’re going to Wembley, Come on You Hatters,” reads a digital sign on the A1081, a dual carriageway into Luton off the M1.There has been worldwide interest in the occasion and these clubs, despite their past, have never experienced such profile. Supporters are set to fly in from Scandinavia, Sydney and Argentina. Luton’s remarkable story – in particular their Oak Road away entrance – has gone global. “Erling Haaland’s not going to walk through that entrance, he’s going to walk through the other shit entrance we’ve got,” says Sweet. “We’ve got to embrace it. We will.”TopicsChampionshipCoventry CityLuton TownfeaturesReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedFootballLive scoresTablesFixturesResultsCompetitionsClubsNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The soon-to-be 31-year-old Hopkins would have counted close to $31m against the cap this season.His cap hit in dead money is $22.6m. The good news for the Cardinals is he’ll be off the books for 2024, when the team figures to be more competitive.Hopkins – still one of the NFL’s elite receivers when healthy – is free to sign with any team. His 11,298 career yards receiving already rank 36th in league history.Arizona is rebuilding under new head coach Jonathan Gannon and general manager Monti Ossenfort and keeping Hopkins’ expensive contract didn’t make much sense, particularly because franchise quarterback Kyler Murray is likely to miss part of the upcoming season while recovering from a knee injury.The Cardinals tried for months to trade Hopkins, but his expensive contract made that difficult.Hopkins had 221 catches for 2,696 yards and 17 touchdowns in 35 games with Arizona. His most famous catch was a last-second heave from Murray in the end zone against the Buffalo Bills in 2020 that became known as ‘Hail Murray’.His 2020 season was his best in the desert. He caught a franchise-record 115 passes for 1,407 yards and six touchdowns.For a few months, the Murray-Hopkins combo looked like it would grow into one of the most prolific in the NFL. The Cardinals started the 2021 season with a 10-2 record thanks to their high-powered offense, but Hopkins and Murray both battled injuries in the latter half of the year and the team faded, barely making the playoffs before getting blown out by the Rams in the wild-card round.Hopkins never got on track in 2022, starting the year with a six-game suspension after testing positive for performance-enhancing drugs. The Cardinals finished with a 4-13 record, leading to the firing of coach Kliff Kingsbury. The team also parted ways with GM Steve Keim.TopicsNFLArizona CardinalsUS sportsReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedSoccerNFLTennisMLBMLSNBANHLF1GolfNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

His sanction would have been three months longer, the commission’s written reasons reveal, had Toney not been diagnosed during the investigation as having a gambling addiction.Ivan Toney hit with eight-month football ban for breaching betting rulesRead moreToney’s case is one of the most serious breaches of gambling rules that the FA has prosecuted. The commission found that 29 bets related to the club Toney was registered with or on loan with at the time. These included 13 bets on his own club to lose, although Toney was not involved in those games. In 11 cases the bets were against Newcastle while he was on loan elsewhere and the other two relate to a Wigan v Aston Villa match while he was on loan at Wigan but not in the squad.Betting on your own team to lose can carry a life ban, as can gambling on your own performance in a match, something Toney was also found to have done.He placed 15 bets on himself to score and 16 on his team to win. He also shared inside information on a match, used third parties to gamble on his behalf and withheld information from the investigation.The commission concluded that Toney had tried to conceal his betting, “using third parties and their betting accounts … in case there was ever an investigation”. It rejected his claim that he had wanted to conceal his betting only from his parents.Because Toney eventually accepted the 232 breaches, which took place between 2017 and 2021, an original punishment of 15 months was cut to 11. A further reduction in the tariff was agreed by the panel after taking into account Toney’s age – he is now 27 – and the diagnosis of addiction.The panel wrote that Toney had agreed to get help for his addiction and had shown genuine contrition for his rule-breaking.“It is common ground between the parties that … the sanction should be reduced in respect of the personal mitigation that is available to Mr Toney,” the panel wrote. “This includes his relative youth at the time when the breaches began, his previous good record in respect of anything other than on-field breaches, and his genuine remorse which he expressed in fulsome terms before the commission.“The lack of control the player has in respect of gambling is clearly a reflection of his diagnosed gambling addiction.“The position appears to be that Mr Toney has ceased gambling on football although he still gambles on other sports and casino games. He is determined to address his gambling problem with therapy at the conclusion of this season.” This week the England manager Gareth Southgate revealed he had spoken to Toney and said football needed to “look after” the player.“I don’t like the idea we just leave somebody, that they’re not allowed to be part of the football community,” he said. “I don’t think that’s how we should work, how the best rehabilitation programmes work.”Brentford manager Thomas Frank also jumped to Toney’s defence as he said: “Yes, Ivan did something wrong but what I don’t get at all is how can you not let him be involved in football at all for the first four months?“What do you gain from that? If you want to rehabilitate people you give them education, you do something, and now he is left on his own.“He should be forced to go into a hundred schools to tell them about his football and background, that’s how it should work, but I’m a football coach, what do I know?“If I can’t speak to him, then they will have to ban me. If I am not allowed to speak to him on a support level there must be something wrong. I think you’re allowed to contact people even when they’re in prison aren’t you? So I think I’m allowed.”On Friday Brentford said they would “do everything possible” to support Toney, who has scored 20 Premier League goals this season, but under the terms of his ban cannot return to training until September. Questions will now be asked about when the club learned of Toney’s gambling addiction.“The commission noted that none of the charges related to events where Ivan could negatively impact his own team,” Brentford said. “The club will now be doing everything possible to provide support to Ivan and his family to deal with the issues raised in this case. We consider this matter closed and look forward to welcoming Ivan back to training in September and seeing him representing Brentford in the Premier League in January.”On Friday, Toney broke his silence, tweeting: “I’ll speak soon with no filter.”TopicsBrentfordThe FAnewsReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedFootballLive scoresTablesFixturesResultsCompetitionsClubsNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Photograph: Paroma Basu/The GuardianTop Manta is named after the vendors (manteros) who spread their wares on a blanket (manta). “It was established in 2015 after a period of intense police repression to support people who, because of the law, can’t find a place to live or open a bank account and are forced to live in the street,” says Lamine Sarr, a manteros spokesperson who, like many Top Manta members, is from Senegal.The theme for this year’s biennale is The Laboratory of the Future, with Africa as its focus. The Ramon Llull Institute, a Catalan cultural organisation that organises the region’s participation in the biennale, ran a contest, and the architectural practice Leve Productora won with an entry called Following the Fish.Leve’s Daniel Cid says: “We asked, ‘Where do we have a laboratory of the future in Barcelona?’ We thought: Top Manta. Let’s make a project with them that will make us rethink architecture from the perspective of an African immigrant.”Sarr adds: “The fish symbolises that the people in Top Manta aren’t here because they come from poor countries but because their countries have been exploited and colonised for centuries. Fishing by large boats has made it impossible for local fishermen to survive. We decided to choose the fish because it’s symbolic of not only the exploitation of the sea but of all natural resources.”Visitors attend a preview of Catalonia in Venice: Following the Fish at the architecture biennale in Venice last week Photograph: Simone Padovani/Getty ImagesThe stand in Venice is in two parts. The first, a mantero market, depicts the journey of the African diaspora, the hardships of the migration process, the border policies and discriminatory laws of Europe. The second, a reparation workshop, comes from a collaborative process between Leve and architecture students from 26 countries working on new housing models, based on repurposing empty shops and buildings.Cid says the idea is to bring African values of sustainability and communality into the conversation about how we live.We have also been able to demonstrate that this way of living has a much smaller environmental impactDaniel Cid, architectIt is a learning process, says his colleague Eva Serrats, to see a community created out of necessity. “The proposal, from an architectural point of view, is knowing how to live. For example, they have a lot more experience of cooperative living than we do, of communal spaces and communal eating – which doesn’t have to imply poverty – and of using one space to do many things, which also brings life to the street.”Cid adds: “We have also been able to demonstrate that this way of living has a much smaller environmental impact.”In Spain, there is, as yet, no US-style “green card” amnesty offered to undocumented migrants. Last week, Sarr presented the Spanish government with a petition signed by more than 600,000 people calling for the regularisation of the country’s estimated half a million stateless citizens.Last month, the Italian government, led by the far-right prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, declared a state of emergency over the arrival of migrants crossing the Mediterranean. According to government figures, 31,292 migrants arrived into Italy that way between January and April, four times the number in 2022.Some will question the ethics of giving manteros such a prominent platform at the biennale, given that, before Top Manta started producing its own T-shirts and trainers, it sold cheap copies of branded shoes and bags, effectively in breach of copyright.Members of the Top Manta collective at the launch. Photograph: Pau Coll/HandoutThis misses the point, says Cid, that they have been forced into marginal activity to survive. “There’s a food crisis in Senegal that is caused by western interests. Europe exploits them, Europe creates hunger, and when they arrive in Europe they face racist laws that make it impossible for them to work.Barcelona street sellers take on Nike with own-brand trainersRead more“The question isn’t what they have to do to survive, but why we allow such conditions to exist.”Under Spanish law, to obtain legal residency, non-EU immigrants must live in the country for three years, prove they have had a fixed address for at least a year, show they are learning the language and have a work contract for a minimum of one year. Such conditions are often impossible to meet.Serrats says Top Manta will present Catalonia in a new light in Venice. “We want to present Catalonia and the Balearics to the world through different eyes, not through western eyes, and through people whose voice isn’t normally heard, because we believe we can learn a lot from this voice,” she says.“Rather than be curators or narrators, we want them to tell their story.”TopicsGlobal developmentVenice BiennaleSpainMigration and developmentMigrationEuropeArchitecturefeaturesReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Photograph: Kate Connolly/The GuardianTurkeyEurope’s Turkish diaspora split as large numbers vote in election runoff Support for Erdoğan in older communities among Europe’s 3.4 million Turkish voters is strong, while younger people want change in KılıçdaroğluKate Connolly in Berlin and Jon Henley in ParisFri 26 May 2023 07.00 BSTCasting her ballot at the Turkish consulate in Berlin for Sunday’s second round runoff in Turkey’s presidential elections, Cansu Yeni said she and her country faced a make-or-break moment.The 32-year-old was one of many young people who moved to the German capital from Istanbul five years ago in reaction to democratic backsliding under Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.“The country became a dictatorship,” she said. “Me and my friends suffered a lot. Choosing who to vote for is an easy decision.”Yeni is one of 3.4 million Turkish voters in Europe registered to cast their ballots abroad. In the first round the diaspora’s choice was split quite clearly between larger and more-established communities, who backed the incumbent, and smaller, newer communities, who chose the opposition unity candidate, Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu.The continent’s two largest diasporas – Germany, with 1.5 million voters, and France, with 400,000 – and other decades-old communities such as those in the Netherlands and Belgium voted massively for Erdoğan.Cansu Yeni, 32, an architect living in Berlin said voting for Kılıçdaroğlu was an ‘easy decision’. Photograph: Kate Connolly/The GuardianAlmost 66% of Turkish voters in Germany backed the conservative incumbent. In France, the Netherlands and Belgium, also home to decades-old communities, the corresponding figures were 64%, 68% and 72%.“You live abroad, you’re not much affected by what’s going on at home, yet you feel closer to it than to your adopted country – the temptation is to vote for someone who flatters your religious and national identity,” said Claire Koç, a Franco-Turkish writer.On a recent day in the tree-lined grounds of the consulate in western Berlin, those who were eligible to vote at one of the 17 polling stations across Germany, were being ushered into booths. A man with a megaphone directed the crowds.Instead of ticking a box, voters stamped ballot papers. For Rosa Burç, political sociologist and researcher at the German Centre for Integration and Migration Research (DeZIM), this adds even more potency to the act of voting. “For many people that physical act of stamping has become a way for them to express a lot of their years of pent up anger and frustration,” she said.Throughout the morning, a stream of shuttle buses and minivans pulled up in front of the consulate discharging voters from Berlin and other parts of Germany. In the courtyard the atmosphere was mostly upbeat, with people greeting and hugging each other, though sporadic scuffles broke out.Yeni, who works as an architect, said she had voted for Kılıçdaroğlu. “He says he will bring back democracy to the country and I believe him. He ran a very peaceful election campaign and this is what we need. Basically if he wins, many people will feel they can return home, including me, because it’s hard being an immigrant,” she said.Gülden, 31, a retail worker who declined to give her surname, said she had come to “support our president”.For her and her parents, who came to Germany as Gastarbeiter (guest workers) in the late 70s, Erdoğan is the only option.“He did a lot for our country so there are many, many reasons to vote for him,” she said.Asked about his response to the recent earthquake, for which the government has faced huge criticism and been accused of incompetence, or his human rights record, she said: “He did a lot to help people after the earthquake. I see this for myself on A Haber [a private, pro-government Turkish TV news channel]. And he admitted he had made some mistakes and I respect him for that.” As for his human rights, she added: “I don’t know much about that as I’m living here but I haven’t heard that there are any problems.”Yasin Acarbaş, 36, and his dog Charlie, outside the Turkish consulate in Berlin after casting his vote. Photograph: Kate Connolly/The GuardianHüseyin, 68, a Turkish Kurd clutching amber prayer beads, who received political asylum in Germany five years ago, said he would meet friends at a roundabout cafe in Berlin’s Kreuzberg district to watch the results on Sunday evening. “There are two people in this race,” he said. “A democrat and a fascist. We want to get rid of the fascist so that we can go back home.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up to This is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pivotal stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The second round, voting for which closed on Tuesday, is thought to have attracted more voters.“Voters in Germany as elsewhere, consider this election as a significant juncture for Turkey, which has meant mobilisation has increased over the past week or so, with people feeling they have to make a very clear statement,” said Burç.Holding his scottish terrier Charlie, 36-year-old Yasin Acarbaş, a Berlin resident who left Turkey a decade ago after the Gezi Park protests, said: “I don’t feel I should have the right to vote when I’m not living in a country. But I feel it’s necessary to use my vote for the last time in order to try to get rid of Erdoğan.”Elif, 36, a student, standing in front of a large Turkish flag stretched across the consulate railings taking selfies with three friends, said she had turned up to vote “so that Turkey wins”. Born in Berlin to guest worker parents from Antalya, she said she feared the changes a Kılıçdaroğlu government might bring.“I’m concerned the country will go back to how it was 20 years ago, when many houses had no running water and no toilets,” she said. “So it would be better to keep things just as they are.”In smaller and more recent communities in Europe, the narrative is very different. In places like the Baltic states, where polling stations have been opened for Turkish voters for the first time this year, Kılıçdaroğlu is the favourite.He garnered 80% of the vote in Lithuania, for example, where first-generation Turkish immigrants are in general much younger, more likely to be university-educated, and broadly pro-European.In Estonia, 91% of votes went to the opposition candidate, while in Poland he won 85%. In the UK, whose 130,000 immigrants from Turkey are mostly Turkish Cypriots, members of the Alevi religious minority or Kurds, Erdoğan won only 18% of the vote.Sweden, home to another Kurdish community that has led to tensions with Turkey, voted 53% for Kılıçdaroğlu and 44% for Erdoğan.After the closure of polling booths across Europe earlier this week, in a carefully coordinated operation, a cargo plane landed in each location to pick up the diaspora votes before flying them back to Ankara to be stored in the Turkish chamber of commerce until polls in Turkey close on Sunday evening.TopicsTurkeyRecep Tayyip ErdoğanGermanyFranceEuropefeaturesReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Last month, the municipality started a “stay away” campaign – aimed first at misbehaving Britons – that banned alcohol sales in shops at the weekend and imposed earlier closing times for window brothels and pubs.‘It damages our free spirit’: war on British tourists won’t work, say AmsterdammersRead moreNow, tourists and residents alike face a €100 (£87) fine for public cannabis smoking in and around the red light district, to “reduce crowding and nuisance in the area”.For locals sick of rowdy stag nights, piles of rubbish and their doorsteps being used as lavatories, the ban in De Wallen – “the old city walls” – is a sign their concerns are being taken seriously. The Amsterdam mayor, Femke Halsema, and all political parties agree that crowds of post-pandemic tourists have compromised livability, while at peak times emergency vehicles cannot access the narrow, medieval streets.“Finally, smoking cannabis is banned in public spaces,” said Diederik Boomsma, a Christian Democratic Appeal councillor who has long campaigned for tourists to be banned from buying cannabis at all.“This will send an important message to the gormless and feckless who think they can come here on a holiday from morality. Newsflash to all potheads: go giggle elsewhere! Let’s hope that the citizens of Amsterdam reclaim their ancient, beautiful city centre from the glassy-eyed zombies.”Els Iping, a local resident, and the “Stop de Gekte” (stop the madness) group had got so sick of the nuisance that in recent months they had mounted vigilante “Wallen Watch” patrols on weekend nights, asking tourists to behave. “We don’t want that image of sex and drugs any more,” she said, adding that the patrols had been suspended due to intimidation from local businesses. “Tourists have never sworn at us: they just say sorry, because they also think it’s all a bit strange. We are happy with every step the council takes.”The city has bigger plans. Halsema is talking to private developers about building a controversial, large-scale erotic centre elsewhere and removing 100 brothel windows from the Wallen. She has not given up on the idea of enforcing a national residents-only law for coffee shops – where semi-legal cannabis is for sale. Meanwhile, there is a national determination to crack down on drug-related criminality that research suggests is behind some of the cash-based red light district businesses.Cannabis is still for sale in coffee shops. Photograph: Urbanmyth/AlamyBut on the evening before the ban began, business owners were gathering worriedly on the streets, cursing resident activists and worrying that tourists would stop coming.Jim Zielinski, a spokesperson for the Bulldog coffee shop and a board member of business group Biz Burgwallen, said some were angry. “The soul of the neighbourhood, what makes it so extraordinary, is slowly being pulled out,” he said. “It’s like a game of Jenga: each time they take a block away and at some point the whole pile will collapse.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up to This is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pivotal stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Ethan Nordberg, 19, an American studying in Germany, was surprised at the new fines. “We did see signs but we thought they were just there,” he said. His friend Jason Diehl, 18, added that the Netherlands was still relatively permissive. “There’s a €140 fine for public urination, but in the US, you would go on the sex offenders list for indecent exposure!” he said.A middle-aged English man sitting on a cafe terrace furtively smoking a joint had not heard about the “stay away” campaign. He decided he didn’t want to talk to the press.Some locals worry Amsterdammers are just as likely to be caught up in the fines, especially after long-running battles with the council over new Airbnb-style rental regulation. “The rules will be difficult for visitors to understand, because they might be able to smoke on the other side of the canal, or on a private terrace in the red light district,” said Maarten Bruinsma, chair of the Amsterdam Gastvrij, and a bed and breakfast owner. “So we can only hope the council doesn’t treat unwitting offenders as disproportionately as they did short-stay hosts, who made unintentional mistakes thanks to complex rules.”The policy sparked contrarian instincts among others. One occasional joint smoker commented: “It almost makes one want to sit on one’s front step smoking cannabis in public.”TopicsNetherlandsCannabisDrugsEuropefeaturesReuse this contentMore on this storyMore on this storyAmsterdam tells young British men who want a ‘messy’ weekend to stay away28 Mar 2023European drug agency opposes Amsterdam’s erotic centre plans8 Mar 2023Amsterdam to outlaw cannabis-smoking in red-light district streets10 Feb 2023Multi-storey ‘erotic centre’ set to replace Amsterdam red light district – if locals can agree where12 Nov 2022Amsterdam calls for crackdown on menace of souped-up e-bikes14 Jan 2023Dutch court sides with squatters of sanctions-hit Russian’s mansion22 Nov 2022Amsterdam considers banning ‘cannabis tourists’ from its coffee shops1 Oct 2022Cleaners at Amsterdam gallery ordered to let insects run wild in name of art25 Sept 2022Most viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

He’s only seven, but he’ll need to be prepared for what’s to come.”It appears the events of the past few days have been too much for many, far older, Spaniards to take in, too. The abuse hurled at Real Madrid’s Brazilian winger, Vinícius Júnior during a match against Valencia on Sunday has already resulted in three swift arrests. Four other people, meanwhile, have been arrested in connection with the dummy, dressed in the player’s shirt, that was hung from a bridge in the Spanish capital.Mohamed’s parents, Ibrahim Ndao and Milene Dos Santos. Photograph: Pablo García Sacristán/The GuardianThe 22-year-old footballer, who was reduced to tears by the latest racist aggressions, said his treatment was proof of just how thoroughly racism permeates both La Liga and Spanish society.“I’m sorry for those Spaniards who disagree but today, in Brazil, Spain is known as a country of racists,” he said after the match.Vinícius Júnior. Photograph: Alberto Saiz/APHis words were echoed by Brazil’s president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who called on Fifa and La Liga to take “serious measures”, adding: “We cannot allow fascism and racism to seize control of football stadiums.”Those charges have forced Spain’s political leaders to position themselves on the issue of racism as the country goes to the polls for regional and municipal elections on Sunday. The Socialist prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, said that “hatred and xenophobia should have no place in football nor in our society”. A government spokesperson went further, insisting perpetrators of racism behaviour “are prosecuted and punished” in Spain.Alberto Núñez Feijóo, the leader of the conservative People’s party, said racism and sport were “totally incompatible”, but added: “Spain is not a racist country in any way.”00:43La Liga teams hold 'racists out of football' banner in support of Vinícius Júnior – videoThe campaign trail platitudes and denials felt rather remote to some of those gathered around the pitch where Mohamed and his teammates were training in Lavapiés, the diverse Madrid neighbourhood where African and Bangladeshi shops and restaurants rub up against hipster coffee shops. Their neighbourhood club, Dragones de Lavapiés, fields 20 teams made up of about 400 players from more than 50 countries.Dos Santos, who was born in Portugal to parents from Cape Verde but has lived in Spain for 30 of her 32 years, said she had grown up with all manner of microaggressions, from people touching her hair to repeated questions as to why she spoke such good Spanish.“It’s a burden I’ve carried since I was a kid,” she said. “I grew up here but I’ve never felt like I was from here.”The Dragones are based in a diverse Madrid neighbourhood. Photograph: Pablo García Sacristán/The GuardianShe and her husband, Ibrahim Ndao, who was born in Senegal, felt bad about the abuse Vinícius had suffered, but were not surprised by it.“There’s systemic racism in Spain and I hope what’s happened opens people’s eyes to it,” she said. “Maybe people with privilege will take notice. Maybe it’s easier not to acknowledge the reality or maybe lots of people just aren’t conscious of it. There are very few politicians of colour; you look at all the TV election debates and there’s no one of colour.” Spain, she added, “still has a long way to go”.Mame Gueye, who had brought her eight-year-old son, Serigne, to Dragones training said she had felt awful when she saw what Vinícius had been forced to endure.Mame Gueye: ‘I don’t agree Spain is a racist country.’ Photograph: Pablo García Sacristán/The Guardian“He was so depressed and powerless about what was happening,” she said. “I think he was scared and nervous and has suffered a lot and no one has done anything. He’s complained and nothing’s been done.”However, Gueye, who moved to Spain from Senegal 15 years ago, disagreed with some of the player’s comments. “Racism exists here but I don’t agree Spain is a racist country,” she said.The Dragones de Lavapiés, which was founded nine years ago, exists to defend and promote diversity and to fight racism and stereotypes. The club’s president, Dolores Galindo, said that while its players and their families experienced racism on a daily basis, that racism still goes unseen by much of Spanish society.“If you’re a white person and you’ve never experienced it personally, you don’t believe in racism,” said Galindo, who is white. “Until you spend a lot of time with kids of colour – especially African kids – you don’t realise just how often things happen to them, one after another. And it’s not just someone saying something on the pitch.”She pointed to a recent trip when some of the younger dragons were taken to a museum. Although all the children stood on the museum’s lawn, the only one called out – twice – by a security guard was a boy of African heritage.“People are talking now about whether or not Spain is racist,” said Galindo. “I’m Spanish and I love my country and I don’t want that to exist here. But you can’t try to isolate it and say, ‘No, this only exists in football’.”According to a survey published last year, 25% of Spaniards aged 15-29 (the majority of them male) hold clearly racist or xenophobic views, with most of their racial hatred directed at Gypsies and people from sub-Saharan Africa and Morocco. Figures from Spain’s interior ministry show that Spanish police investigated 639 racist or xenophobic incidents in 2021 – a 24% rise on 2019.Neither the statistics nor the probably fleeting media and political debate over racism come as any surprise to Okba Mohammad, a 24-year-old Syrian journalist who has lived in Spain since fleeing his home town of Deraa during the Bashar al-Assad regime’s Russian-backed offensive there five years ago.The Dragones de Lavapiés try to defend and promote diversity. Photograph: Pablo García Sacristán/The Guardian“Spain is obviously a racist country,” he said. “There’s institutional racism but there’s also racism because of the lack of anti-racist education. There are a lot of people who are racist without knowing it, or people who are racist because they want to be racist.”For all the outcry over Vinícius, he added, the abuse could have been directed at any black or non-white player.Vinícius Júnior and why it’s time to stop talking about the football | Sid LoweRead more“My problem is with the reaction, because there are a lot of people who are suffering racism every day and who haven’t been afforded this kind of institutional, social or media reaction,” said Mohammad.He also contrasted the speed of the arrests in the Vinícius case with his own ill-fated attempts to report racist behaviour he has suffered. While the media were guilty of double-standards by focusing on the plight of one footballer and ignoring the daily lived experiences of so many other victims of racism in Spain, he added, its hypocrisy was nothing new – and was indicative of a wider, and far more deeply ingrained prejudice.“We saw the huge scale of the institutional racism with the war in Ukraine when the Ukrainian refugees came to Spain and to other European countries,” he said. “They brought in a law to give the Ukrainians their papers within 24 hours. When that happened, I’d been waiting two and a half years in Spain for my papers to come through.”For all the column inches, the soundbites and the pledges, Mohammad thinks Sunday’s poisonous events in the Valencia’s Mestalla stadium – and the deeper wells of toxicity from which they sprang – will soon fade from public discourse.“I think this will be forgotten,” he said. “But the people who won’t forget it are the people of colour who suffer racism and report it every day.”TopicsSpainRaceReal MadridEuropeLa LigaInequalityfeaturesReuse this contentMore on this storyMore on this storySpanish police make arrests over ‘hate crimes’ targeting Vinícius Júnior3d ago‘Everything we do is about connection’: 50 years of Pacha and the Ibiza club scene4d ago‘Racism is normal in La Liga’: Vinícius Júnior outraged by abuse at Valencia5d agoVillages evacuated as ‘very large’ wildfire ravages south-west Spain19 May 2023Spain hopes domestic tasks app will ensure men pull their weight19 May 2023Spanish climber, 84, injured in bid to be oldest to scale world’s 14 highest peaks17 May 2023Spanish cash machine gangs broken up with 14 arrests17 May 2023Spanish PM offers €2 cinema tickets for over-65s ahead of regional elections14 May 2023Most viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Newman ordered the law put on hold until the state supreme court can review it, in a ruling that came 24 hours after the law was signed by governor Henry McMaster, the AP reports.The state now reverts to a previous law that bans abortions at about the 20-week mark.Key events3h agoThe day so far4h agoJudge temporarily halts new South Carolina abortion restrictions5h agoDeSantis officials ask lobbyists for campaign contributions in potential breach of state law7h agoEmerging debt limit deal would cut spending by less than GOP demanded - reports7h agoDebt ceiling compromise reportedly at hand — but passing it is another matterShow key events onlyPlease turn on JavaScript to use this feature3m ago20.50 BSTThe Republican presidential field will gain a new entrant early next month, when North Dakota governor Doug Burgum announces his campaign for president, the Washington Post reports.Burgum does not have much of a national profile, and it’s unclear how he will differentiate himself from the race’s frontrunner Donald Trump and his strongest challenger, Florida governor Ron DeSantis. Burgum has signed a law banning almost all abortions in the reliably-Republican state, and another cracking down on transgender rights.Despite his pursuit of rightwing policies typical of Republican governors nationwide, Burgum complained to the editorial board of North Dakota newspaper the Forum that many Americans feel alienated from the political process. “There’s definitely a yearning for some alternatives right now,” he said.17m ago20.36 BSTJust what is keeping the debt ceiling negotiators from finding a deal?

1h ago19.36 BSTThe South Carolina anti-abortion bill now on hold was approved on Tuesday. Here’s a bit more on what it contained:If signed into law the bill would ban most abortions at about six weeks, a period when most people are unaware they are pregnant.The Fetal Heartbeat and Protection From Abortion Act would ban abortions at the earliest detection of cardiac activity, and, if signed into law, would set up a judicial battle over whether the bill is constitutional. The bill already passed the state house legislature with overwhelming support, and is part of a wave of anti-abortion legislation passed or proposed throughout the country since the supreme court overturned Roe v Wade last year and eliminated the constitutional right to abortion.Abortion access in the south – which already has some of the most restrictive laws in the country – has been dramatically curtailed with new legislation in North Carolina and Florida. A series of Texas laws prohibit abortions after six weeks and make performing abortions a felony punishable up to life in prison.The Guardian’s Nick Robins-Early reported for us on the decision earlier this week:South Carolina passes six-week abortion ban after heated debateRead more2h ago19.22 BSTHere’s some markets news.

Wall Street jumped on Friday following progress in negotiations on raising the U.S. debt ceiling, while chip stocks surged for a second straight day on optimism about artificial intelligence.After several rounds of talks, U.S. President Joe Biden and top congressional Republican Kevin McCarthy appeared to be nearing a deal to increase the government’s $31.4 trillion debt limit for two years, while capping spending on most items, a U.S. official told Reuters.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was set to end a five-day losing streak, while the Nasdaq Composite Index jumped to its highest level since August 2022.”
Investors were closely watching debt ceiling talks as Biden and McCarthy still seemed at odds over several issues heading into the long weekend, with the U.S. stock market closed on Monday for the Memorial Day holiday.“All the signs point to a deal getting done and this rally being sustained, but if we get through the weekend and we don’t have a deal or it falls apart in some way, then we’re going to wake up Tuesday morning to some pretty material losses,” said Scott Ladner, chief investment officer at Horizon Investments in Charlotte, North Carolina.

Obama further tweets that: “Earlier this year, Democrats took control of the State Senate by one seat after winning a race by just 321 votes. It gave Democrats control of both chambers of the state legislature and the governor’s mansion.“Since then, Minnesota has made progress on a whole host of issues – from protecting abortion rights and new gun safety measures to expanding access to the ballot and reducing child poverty. These laws will make a real difference in the lives of Minnesotans.”And a further optimistic note.It's a reminder that, while the pace of change can often be slow, a small group of people can still help us take a giant leap forward – but only if we vote.— Barack Obama (@BarackObama) May 26, 2023
The Minpost.com article Obama linked to in the first tweet describes the legislative session just ended as “transformational” and “bonkers” depending on your party.The so-called DFL, which stands for Democratic Farmer Labor party, aka the Democrats in Minnesota, “codified abortion rights, paid family and medical leave, sick leave, transgender rights protections, drivers licenses for undocumented residents, restoration of voting rights for people when they are released from prison or jail, wider voting access, one-time rebates, a tax credit aimed at low-income parents with kids, and a $1 billion investment in affordable housing including for rental assistance,” the publication noted.Minnesota State Representative Leigh Finke poses for a photo with supporters before the Minnesota Senate introduces the Trans Refuge Bill at the State Capitol Building in Saint Paul, Minnesota, on April 21, 2023. - The Minnesota legislature passed a ""trans refuge"" bill that would guarantee legal protection for trans people coming to Minnesota from elsewhere to access medical care.

The new law is among similar measures that have been approved in other Republican-dominated statehouses around the country. As with many of those proposals, Iowa Republicans framed their action as a commonsense effort to ensure that parents can oversee what their children are learning in school and that teachers not delve into topics such as gender and sexuality.
Despite the opposition of all Democratic legislators, Republicans who hold large majorities in Iowa’s state House and Senate approved the measure in April and there was little doubt that Reynolds would sign it; she had made issues related to gender identity and sexuality a focal point of her legislative agenda this year.
“This legislative session, we secured transformational education reform that puts parents in the driver’s seat, eliminates burdensome regulations on public schools, provides flexibility to raise teacher salaries, and empowers teachers to prepare our kids for their future,” Reynolds said in a statement.
Under the new law, school administrators also would be required to notify parents if students asked to change their pronouns or names. Religious texts will be exempt from the library ban on books depicting sex acts.
Democrats and LGBTQ+ groups argued that the restrictions would hurt children by limiting their ability to be open with teachers about gender and sexuality issues and to see their lives reflected in books and other curriculum.
The law also requires schools to post online a list of books in libraries, along with instructions for parents on how to review them and classroom instructional material, and to request that any material be removed. Schools would need parental approval before they could give surveys to students related to numerous topics, including mental health issues, sex and political affiliation.
This builds on two bills that Reynolds signed into law earlier in the year, restricting the restrooms transgender students can use and banning gender-affirming medical care, such as puberty blockers, for people younger than 18.

Photograph: Charlie Neibergall/AP2h ago18.32 BSTThe anti-abortion law that a judge in South Carolina just blocked is similar to a ban on abortion once cardiac activity can be detected that lawmakers there had passed in 2021.The Associated Press adds:
The state supreme court decided previously that the 2021 law violated the state constitution’s right to privacy. Legislative leaders said the new law makes technical tweaks. But judge Clifton Newman said: “The status quo should be maintained until the supreme court reviews its decision. It’s going to end up there.”
Tuesday’s law went into effect immediately after it was signed and Planned Parenthood reported that nearly all of the 75 women with appointments for abortions over the next several days appeared to be past six weeks pregnant, an attorney for the women’s health group, Kathleen McDaniel said, who said the harm to women “is happening. It has already happened.”
The South Carolina measure joins stiff limitations pending in North Carolina and Florida, states that had been holdouts providing wider access to the procedure.
3h ago17.57 BSTThe day so farWe are awaiting news of a debt ceiling deal, amid reports that negotiators for Joe Biden and Kevin McCarthy are nearing an agreement that would cut some government spending while preserving many of the White House’s priorities. Meanwhile, the GOP-led push to tighten abortion access was dealt a setback in South Carolina, where a judge temporarily halted a newly passed ban on procedures past the sixth week of pregnancy until the state supreme court can review it.Here is what else has happened today:
A judge has blocked a South Carolina law enacted this week that bans most abortions past the six-week mark. Clifton Newman ordered the law put on hold until the state supreme court can review it, in a ruling that came 24 hours after the law was signed by governor Henry McMaster.
Officials in Ron DeSantis’s administration have asked lobbyists for contributions to his newly announced presidential campaign, raising ethical and potentially legal questions.
Texas lawmakers could as soon as today oust the state’s attorney general over an array of misconduct.
No matter how the debt limit standoff is resolved, the United States is on a worrying financial path, a government report concludes.

The Guardian’s Richard Luscombe takes a look at the feud, and what it might mean for DeSantis’s White House bid:It has become one of the most compelling Disney stories ever told, but so far without a happily ever after. In fact, the entrance this week of Florida’s Republican governor Ron DeSantis into the race for his party’s presidential nomination only adds gasoline to his raging feud with the theme park giant over diversity and transgender rights.It’s a battle that is, conversely, both an essential ingredient to the culture war agenda DeSantis believes will win him the White House in 2024; and a headache he could well do without as he attempts to prove his credentials as a fiscally responsible conservative.From the moment Disney’s bosses dared to speak out in March 2022 against DeSantis’s notorious parental rights in education bill, the so-called “don’t say gay” law that outlaws discussion in Florida’s classrooms of sexual orientation and gender identity, the governor climbed aboard a rollercoaster he doesn’t seem to want to get off.“DeSantis is running for president and looking for issues that will appeal to potential Republican primary voters all across the country,” said Aubrey Jewett, professor of political science at the University of Central Florida, and a long-time Disney observer.“Certainly the main reason for attacking Disney is he believes it will increase his name recognition and visibility in a positive way, but it doesn’t make a lot of sense.Will Ron DeSantis’s culture war with Disney threaten his White House run?Read moreNewestNewestPrevious1 of 2NextOldestOldestTopicsUS politicsRepublicansDemocratsJoe BidenKevin McCarthyReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedUSWorldEnvironmentSoccerUS PoliticsBusinessTechScienceNewslettersFight for democracyNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

I’m working really hard to build back my strength, but touring can be very difficult even when you’re 100%,” the 55-year-old Canadian singer said in a statement posted on her website. “It’s not fair to you to keep postponing the shows, and even though it breaks my heart, it’s best that we cancel everything now until I’m really ready to be back on stage again. I want you all to know, I’m not giving up … and I can’t wait to see you again!”Céline Dion reveals diagnosis of rare neurological disorderRead moreDion first revealed the diagnosis in a tearful video to fans last December, when she postponed the European leg of her Courage World Tour until August 2023. The tour was set to commence in Amsterdam and run through Europe, ending in London in April 2024. The condition, which affects somewhere between 1 and 2 million people worldwide, causes muscle spasms and painful stiffness that worsens over time.“Unfortunately the spasms affect every aspect of my daily life, sometimes causing difficulties when I walk and not allowing me to use my vocal cords to sing the way I’m used to,” Dion said in her announcement of the diagnosis, which came after months of worsening health issues. “I have a great team of doctors working alongside me to help me get better and my precious children who are supporting me and giving me hope. I’m working hard with my support medicine therapist every day to build back my strength and my ability to perform again, but I have to admit it’s been a struggle.”Dion first spoke about her symptoms in October 2021, when she postponed the beginning of her Las Vegas residency due to what she described as “severe and persistent” muscle spasms. “I’m heartbroken by this,” she said. “My team and I have been working on our new show for the past eight months, and to not be able to open this November saddens me beyond words.”There is no known cure for Stiff Person Syndrome, but it is treatable through chemical intervention and immune therapies.The singer most recently appeared in her first film role for the romance film Love Again, starring Priyanka Chopra and Sam Heughan. While she released five new songs for the film, she did not appear at any premieres.In the statement posted to her website, Dion’s team expressed optimism for Dion’s future tours: “We do have every hope that someday soon, Celine will be able to come to all of these cities in Europe to perform for her amazing fans, but that time simply is not now.”TopicsCéline DionnewsReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedBooksMusicTV & radioArt & designFilmGamesClassicalStageNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

 Is No 10 waking up to dangers of AI?Kiran Stacey and Rowena MasonFri 26 May 2023 16.00 BSTLast modified on Fri 26 May 2023 17.01 BSTRishi Sunak is scrambling to update the government’s approach to regulating artificial intelligence, amid warnings that the industry poses an existential risk to humanity unless countries radically change how they allow the technology to be developed.The prime minister and his officials are looking at ways to tighten the UK’s regulation of cutting-edge technology, as industry figures warn the government’s AI white paper, published just two months ago, is already out of date.Is No 10 waking up to dangers of artificial intelligence?Read moreGovernment sources have told the Guardian the prime minister is increasingly concerned about the risks posed by AI, only weeks after his chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, said he wanted the UK to “win the race” to develop the technology.Sunak is pushing allies to formulate an international agreement on how to develop AI capabilities, which could even lead to the creation of a new global regulator. Meanwhile Conservative and Labour MPs are calling on the prime minister to pass a separate bill that could create the UK’s first AI-focused watchdog.A Downing Street spokesperson said: “The starting point for us is safety, and making sure the public have confidence in how AI is being used on their behalf. Everyone is well aware of the potential benefits and risks of AI. Some of this tech is moving so fast it’s unknown.”For several months, British ministers have spoken optimistically about the opportunities AI presents for the country.Michelle Donelan, as science, innovation and technology secretary, published a white paper in April which set out five broad principles for developing the technology, but said relatively little about how to regulate it. In her foreword to that paper, she wrote: “AI is already delivering fantastic social and economic benefits for real people.”In recent months, however, the advances in the automated chat tool ChatGPT and the warning by Geoffrey Hinton, the “godfather of AI”, that the technology poses an existential risk to humankind, have prompted a change of tack within government.Experts say it will soon be possible for companies to use the technology to decide who to hire and fire, for police to use it to detect suspects and for governments to manipulate elections.Last week, Sunak met four of the world’s most senior executives in the AI industry, including Sundar Pichai, the chief executive of Google, and Sam Altman, the chief executive of ChatGPT’s parent company OpenAI. After the meeting that included Altman, Downing Street acknowledged for the first time the “existential risks” now being faced.On Monday, British officials will join their counterparts from other G7 member countries to discuss AI’s implications for intellectual property protections and disinformation.“There has been a marked shift in the government’s tone on this issue,” said Megan Stagman, an associate director at the government advisory firm Global Counsel. “Even since the AI white paper, there has been a dramatic shift in thinking.”Some MPs are now pushing for an AI bill to be passed through the Commons which could set certain conditions for companies who want to develop the technology in the UK. Some want to see the creation of an AI-specific regulator.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterArchie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morningPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Let’s say I dismiss you from a job on the basis of an AI recommendation, am I still liable?He added: “We need an AI bill. The problem of who should regulate it is a tricky one but I don’t think you can hand it off to regulators for other industries.”Lucy Powell, Labour’s spokesperson for digital, culture, media and sport, said: “The AI white paper is a sticking plaster on this huge long-term shift. Relying on overstretched regulators to manage the multiple impacts of AI may allow huge areas to fall through the gaps.”Her colleague Darren Jones, who chairs the business select committee, wrote to Sunak this week calling on him to promote the UK as a possible host for an international AI agency, along the lines of the International Atomic Energy Agency.Government insiders admit there has been a shift in approach, but insist they will not follow the EU’s example of regulating each use of AI in a different way. MEPs are currently scrutinising a new law that would allow for AI in some contexts but ban it in others, such as for facial recognition.“We don’t want to regulate product-by-product,” said one. “We want to stay nimble, because the technology is changing so fast.”TopicsArtificial intelligence (AI)Rishi SunakComputingnewsReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedWorldUKCoronavirusClimate crisisEnvironmentScienceGlobal developmentFootballTechBusinessObituariesNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Photograph: Alexandr Mitiuc/AlamyThe GS-9209 galaxy was discovered in 2004 by Karina Caputi, a former PhD student at Edinburgh who is now a professor of observational cosmology at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands.While GS-9209 has roughly as many stars as our home galaxy, with a combined mass equal to 40bn suns, it is only one-tenth the size of the Milky Way. It is the earliest known example of a galaxy that has stopped forming stars, the researchers said.Supermassive black holes can shut down star formation because their growth releases huge quantities of high-energy radiation, which can heat up and drive gas out of galaxies. Galaxies need vast clouds of gas and dust to collapse under their own gravity, thereby creating new stars.“The fact [that the black hole] is so massive means it must have been very active in the past, with lots of gas falling in, which would have shone extremely brightly as a quasar,” Carnall said. “All that energy spewing out from the black hole in the centre of the galaxy would have seriously disrupted the whole galaxy, stopping gas from collapsing to form new stars.”More details are published in Nature.TopicsScienceLab notesJames Webb space telescopeBlack holesAstronomySpacenewsReuse this contentMore on this storyMore on this storyJames Webb telescope detects evidence of ancient ‘universe breaker’ galaxies22 Feb 2023James Webb telescope captures ‘cosmic fingerprint’ formed by two giant stars12 Oct 2022Neptune and its rings shown in striking new light by Webb telescope21 Sept 2022‘Historic’ James Webb images show exoplanet in unprecedented detail1 Sept 2022James Webb telescope gives a stunning look at galaxies far, far away24 Aug 2022Nasa publishes flurry of images from James Webb space telescope12 Jul 2022James Webb telescope promises a glimpse of the birth of the universe12 Jul 2022First images from Nasa’s James Webb space telescope reveal ancient galaxies11 Jul 2022Most viewedMost viewedWorldUKCoronavirusClimate crisisEnvironmentScienceGlobal developmentFootballTechBusinessObituariesNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

He will be sentenced later on Friday.Watkins and Harrelson were acquitted of seditious conspiracy charges.Watkins told the judge: “My actions and my behavior that fateful day were wrong and, as I now understand, criminal,” she said.Friday’s court proceedings were taking place one day after Mehta sentenced the Oath Keepers’ founder, Stewart Rhodes, to 18 years in prison for crimes including seditious conspiracy, or using force to try to overthrow the federal government. That is the steepest penalty yet against those charged in the January 6 violence.Members of the Oath Keepers, founded by Rhodes in 2009, include current and retired US military personnel, law enforcement officers and first responders.TopicsUS Capitol attackThe far rightUS politicsLaw (US)newsReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedUSWorldEnvironmentSoccerUS PoliticsBusinessTechScienceNewslettersFight for democracyNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Photograph: Olivier Matthys/EPAThe students were given sentences of up to 300 hours of community service and a €400 fine each. The prosecution had sought sentences of up to 50 months in prison for some of them.The high salt content in the fish oil was an important element in Dia’s death and the court ruled that the students could not have known about the potentially fatal impact on the freshman. De Brauwer said that once the students realised the seriousness of his condition, they tried to help Dia and get him to hospital.The two other students were left seriously ill but their hazing was not part of the court case.De Brauwer said all 18 who took part in the hazing were guilty because “they were all there. No one called a halt to it. No one questioned it.”After Dia’s death, Belgian universities sought to make sure that the autumn initiation rituals for first-year students would be less degrading.TopicsBelgiumStudentsEuropenewsReuse this contentMore on this storyMore on this storyRenovation of Brussels park ignites debate on decolonisation18 May 2023Belgian police arrest seven people over terror attack plot4 May 2023Ex-fraternity members back in Belgian court over death of black student13 Mar 2023Belgian MEP arrested in ‘cash for influence’ inquiry10 Feb 2023Rioters torch a car in Brussels after Belgium’s World Cup defeat to Morocco27 Nov 2022Belgium needs more incinerators to burn seized cocaine21 Nov 2022Belgium’s trade in Russian diamonds continues despite moral pressure20 Nov 2022Last veteran of Belgian SAS dies aged 9712 Aug 2022Thousands of racing pigeons go missing in French storm3 Aug 2022Critics told ‘lives at stake’ over Belgium-Iran prisoner swap treaty5 Jul 2022Most viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

His Rumble show shares a name with one of his books, Triggered: How the Left Thrives on Hate and Wants to Silence Us.He was briefly silent after his gaffe on Thursday night.He had just said: “Once you actually put out the facts I think a different image is going to emerge,” he said. “Ron wants people to think that he’s like ‘Trump-lite’ or something like that. He’s not, either on policy grounds or personality.“Trump has the charisma of a mortician, and the energy that makes Jeb Bush look an Olympian.”After a short pause, and without correcting himself, Trump Jr continued: “The policies of a DC swamp rat because we’ve seen … the flip-flops, right?”Trump Jr also hit DeSantis for the “hashtag DeSaster” of his campaign launch with Elon Musk, the owner of Twitter, and David Sacks, a Republican donor, which he said showed he needed “two charismatic billionaires” to help him through.DeSantis, Trump Jr added, had a “sort of nasally and effeminate … voice”.TopicsDonald Trump JrDonald TrumpRon DeSantisUS elections 2024US politicsnewsReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedUSWorldEnvironmentSoccerUS PoliticsBusinessTechScienceNewslettersFight for democracyNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

They did so after seeing diary entries about guests who were at Chequers during the pandemic, which Johnson handed to lawyers representing him as part of the Covid inquiry.Police fined Johnson more than a year ago in relation to an event in June 2020 for his birthday. More than 100 fines were handed out to others over events held in and around Downing Street.The Partygate saga contributed to the demise of Johnson’s premiership but the former prime minister has since been mulling over whether a comeback is possible. However, Johnson is still facing an inquiry by the privileges committee of MPs into whether he misled the House of Commons by saying all Covid rules were followed.On Friday, Starmer told broadcasters: “I think people are fed up to the back teeth with stories about Boris Johnson. The heart of this is a simple truth that, across the country, people made massive sacrifices during Covid.“Some people not going to the birth of their baby, not going to the funeral of one of their close family members. These are deeply personal things and increasing revelations about Boris Johnson, I think, just add to that sense of hurt, and people are fed up with it.“I do think there are questions now about why have these allegations not come out before, all these allegations.“Obviously, there will be investigations, I understand that.“The core of this is a very human feeling of one rule for us, which we obey, another rule for Boris Johnson and those at the top of the Tory party.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterArchie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morningPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, its website was still advising passengers to check their flight status before heading to the airport, as the knock-on effect of the outage caused further disruption.A spokesperson for the airline said: “While the vast majority of our flights continue to operate today, we have cancelled some of our short-haul flights from Heathrow due to the knock-on effect of a technical issue that we experienced yesterday.“We’ve apologised to customers whose flights have been affected and offered them the option to rebook to an alternative flight with us or another carrier, or request a refund.”The airline has tried to prioritise routes where there are few alternatives by opting to focus cancellations on destinations that are served my multiple flights a day.The breakdown comes at the worst possible time, with 3,000 flights scheduled to depart from the UK on Friday, the largest daily total since before the Covid pandemic.Motoring organisations have also predicted “hectic” conditions on the roads, with more than 19 million people forecast to travel by car between Friday afternoon and Monday morning.According to the analysts Inrix, there will be severe delays on the M25, the M5 in Somerset and the M6 in Cheshire.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There are very few major engineering works, meaning most British rail services will run normally.However, there will be a series of rail strikes in the second half of the school holiday week, with drivers from Aslef out on 31 May and 3 June, and train crews in the RMT union on strike on 2 June. Most services across England are likely to be halted when drivers go on strike, with severe disruption during the RMT action.TopicsAirline industryTransportBritish AirwaysTravel & leisurenewsReuse this contentMore on this storyMore on this storyFlights into Gatwick diverted after reports of drone near airport14 May 2023Sunak eyes deal to allow UK passport holders to use e-gates at EU airports25 Apr 2023Heathrow ‘operating as normal’ as 10-day strike by security staff begins31 Mar 2023UK is Europe’s worst private jet polluter, study finds30 Mar 2023‘It’s just outrageous’: Flybe passengers on the frustration of cancelled flights28 Jan 2023Airport security rules on liquids and laptops could be lifted in UK in 2024 – reports24 Nov 2022Wizz Air named worst airline for UK-departing flight delays28 Aug 2022Ryanair adds 500 flights at Stansted to cover October half-term16 Aug 2022Most viewedMost viewedBusinessEconomicsBankingMoneyMarketsProject SyndicateB2BRetailNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Photograph: Hansrad Collection/AlamyMonarchyElizabeth I heavily influenced by loss of mother Anne Boleyn at young ageEvidence that both women experienced stress and anxiety, with Elizabeth traumatised by mother’s death and issue of marriageLucy KnightFri 26 May 2023 18.23 BSTLast modified on Fri 26 May 2023 18.53 BSTElizabeth I was heavily influenced by her mother Anne Boleyn, despite the fact that the latter died when the Tudor queen was less than three years old, according to the historian and author Tracy Borman.As well as being influenced by feminist ideas that were ahead of their time, Borman said there was evidence they both experienced stress and anxiety.The stress Boleyn was under to produce an heir “is a possible reason” for the three miscarriages she suffered, Borman said. “The other theory ... is that she was rhesus negative”, a condition that can cause miscarriages, but “surely the pressure and the stress has to have toll on Anne’s physical health”.Elizabeth was also psychologically affected by the trauma of losing her mother at a young age, said Borman, who wrote Elizabeth’s Women, about the women who influenced Elizabeth I.“She was given to nervous fits, as they were described, and often stomach complaints. She had migraines. It was very obvious that she been literally traumatised by her early history and, when she was pressed on the issue of marriage, she would become almost hysterical.”Her refusal to marry “went beyond her politics”, Borman believes. “Anne had left an indelible mark on Elizabeth, physically as well as emotionally.”Speaking at the Hay festival in Wales, Borman, said despite the “popular myth” that Elizabeth I did not think much of her mother, the opposite was in fact true.“Elizabeth’s actions speak louder than words,” Borman said, explaining how Elizabeth secretly wore Anne’s famous “A” pendant when she sat for a painting with her father and siblings, and filled her household with members of the Boleyn family.Both women were also influenced by the Princess of France, Marguerite of Navarre, Boleyn directly through her time living in France, who was a great intellectual and introduced Boleyn to the feminist ideas of Christine de Pizan.Later, Elizabeth I discovered the work of Marguerite of Navarre via her stepmother Catherine Parr, and embarked on a translation of one of Marguerite’s most famous works, the poem Miroir de l’âme pécheresse.“I think that was a real tribute to her late mother,” Borman said. “Like Anne, Elizabeth was a great flirt.” She believes the so-called Virgin Queen actually was a virgin. “She had come to equate sex with death from a very early age.”As well as a historian and author, Borman is also the chief curator of the historic royal palaces. Last month she was photographed with the celebrity couple Zendaya and Tom Holland as the actors took a guided tour of Hampton Court palace.TopicsMonarchyHistory booksnewsReuse this contentMore on this storyMore on this storyBuckingham Palace declines to return remains of ‘stolen’ Ethiopian prince, say reports3d agoDuchess’s police motorcycle escort hits elderly woman in London11 May 2023Princess Anne: slimmed-down royal family ‘doesn’t sound like a good idea’2 May 2023King Charles urged to push for breakup of UK’s ‘network of satellite tax havens’30 Apr 2023British public support for monarchy at historic low, poll reveals28 Apr 2023UK anti-monarchy pressure group optimistic amid coronation apathy26 Apr 2023BBC accused of lacking impartiality in royal coverage17 Apr 2023Nearly four in 10 young adults want elected UK head of state, poll finds24 Apr 2023Clive Lewis urges Keir Starmer to pledge to reduce size and cost of royal family14 Apr 2023Was there a secret deal between royal family and Murdoch’s media empire?25 Apr 2023Most viewedMost viewedUKUK politicsEducationMediaSocietyLawScotlandWalesNorthern IrelandNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Once widespread in India, cheetahs became extinct in 1952 from hunting and habitat loss. Their mother was among the 20 cheetahs India flew in from Namibia and South Africa as part of an ambitious and hotly contested plan to reintroduce the world’s fastest land animal to the South Asian country.The first cub died on Tuesday, prompting veterinarians in the national park in Madhya Pradesh state to closely monitor the mother and her three remaining cubs. The cubs appeared weak on Thursday afternoon – a day when temperatures reached 47C (113F) – and authorities intervened to help the cats.They were “weak, underweight and highly dehydrated” and two of them later died, forest officials said in a statement on Thursday.The last surviving cub is being treated in a critical care facility.Officials did not say what caused the deaths but a scorching heatwave in India is believed to have weakened the cubs. The survival rate of cheetah cubs both in the wild and captivity is low, according to experts.The cats were introduced with much fanfare and the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, had said the cats would bolster efforts to conserve India’s neglected grasslands. But of the 20 adult cheetahs imported to India, three – two females and a male – have died.Fewer than 7,000 adult cheetahs remain in the wild globally, and they inhabit less than 9% of their original range. Shrinking habitat, due to the increasing human population and climate change, is a huge threat.TopicsIndiaEndangered speciesWildlifeAnimalsConservationExtreme weathernewsReuse this contentMore on this storyMore on this storyCycads: the primeval plants getting rarer – and harder to protect17 May 2023‘The wolf does not belong here’: German summit convened after animal attacks28 Apr 2023Red list reveals Britain’s extinction-threatened mosses and liverworts28 Apr 2023Polynesian snails release is biggest ever of ‘extinct in the wild’ species27 Apr 2023Last of Iran’s endangered Asiatic cheetah cubs in captivity dies28 Feb 2023Baby seals spotted in record numbers on Norfolk coast15 Jan 2023Chimpanzee born at Chester zoo offers ‘real hope’ for world’s rarest subspecies12 Jan 2023Iberian lynx that helped save species from extinction dies aged 2010 Nov 2022Pine marten spotted in London for first time in more than a century8 Sept 2022Rare hummingbird last seen in 2010 rediscovered in Colombia5 Aug 2022Most viewedMost viewedEnvironmentClimate crisisWildlifeEnergyPollutionNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

If Americans kicked their addiction to cars, it could help avert a climate catastrophe, Henry Grabar writes. Photograph: AlamyClimate crisisHow to improve US cities and tackle the climate crisis? Get rid of parking spacesNew book details how New York could rid the city of rats and create more parks if it repurposed its 3m parking spotsDanielle RenwickFri 26 May 2023 16.30 BSTLast modified on Fri 26 May 2023 16.52 BSTWhat could New York achieve if it repurposed some of its 3m curbside parking spots?It could get rid of rats by moving trash off the sidewalks and into containers. It could create safe, cool play spaces for the more than 1m New Yorkers without easy park access. It could build bioswales to collect rainwater and prevent flooding during heavy storms.It could even help drivers kick their addictions to cars and avert climate catastrophe, writes Henry Grabar, author of Paved Paradise: How Parking Explains the World.Instead, the city devotes most of its curb space – an area equivalent to 52 Central Parks, according to advocacy group Transportation Alternatives – to parking.“We have all this land that’s being currently allocated in one of the least efficient and least environmentally sound ways possible,” Grabar said. “If you begin to think about retrofitting and adapting that, the possibilities are endless.”Nexus MediaPaved Paradise reveals how cheap and convenient car storage exacerbates the housing shortage (the US allocates more land to car storage than to housing), siphons public assets into private hands, blights downtowns and fuels the climate crisis.Grabar, a staff writer at Slate, grew up in Lower Manhattan in the 1990s. In the book, he recounts travails familiar to anyone who has ever looked for parking in New York: his father used to drop the family off in front of their building before he set off in search of a curbside spot; as a teenager, Grabar was often tasked with sitting behind the wheel of his parked family’s station wagon, “… hoping I would not have to move the car when the ticket cop came. I was too young to drive.”He has written about housing, transportation and urban politics for the last decade. “In story after story, I kept finding this hidden factor that seemed to be determinative of the way various projects turned out,” he said. “That system was parking.”Grabar traces much of the design and feel of modern US cities to the postwar era, when American car ownership soared and much of the middle class moved to the suburbs. “The question of where to park all these cars consumed American politicians, shop owners, traffic engineers, and urban planners in the 1950s and 1960s,” he writes. “Cities sought to emulate the suburban parking model and very nearly destroyed themselves in the process.”Today, Americans drive more than almost anyone else in the world, and transportation is the US’s largest source of greenhouse gas emissions. (Electric vehicles may reduce emissions, but the need for chargers brings a host of other parking challenges, Grabar notes.) Americans drive 60% more than Australians and Canadians – and, he writes, “we built a country with exceptional rewards for driving and punishments for getting around any other way”.Parking exacerbates the problem. When it’s free, there are often shortages. Across the country, zoning laws often require new developments to build a set number of off-street parking spots. Those rules, Grabar argues, create sprawl (which in turn incentivizes more driving) and fuel the current housing shortage.The US has the highest rate of road accidents of any OECD country, and traffic fatalities are on the rise. In 2021, about 43,000 people, including more than 7,000 pedestrians, died on US roads, making it an outlier among economically advanced nations.The problem is particularly acute in low-income and minority communities, which are less likely to have sidewalks, marked crossings and other designs meant to make spaces safe for pedestrians. Black pedestrians are nearly twice as likely to be struck and killed in traffic as white pedestrians.Low-income and minority communities are also disproportionately exposed to air pollution – often the result of traffic emissions – and suffer higher rates of asthma and other respiratory ailments.Grabar points out another, perhaps overlooked way that parking contributes to the climate crisis: cement is responsible for nearly 10% of global greenhouse gas emissions.Paving over our cities also makes them less able to adapt to a changing climate. Asphalt and cement contribute to the urban heat island effect, which means that these surfaces create areas that can be several degrees warmer than green spaces nearby. Because of historic redlining practices, minority and low-income communities are more likely to live in urban heat islands.These impervious surfaces also make cities more susceptible to flooding, another phenomenon on the rise as the planet warms. In Houston, Grabar writes, 50 years of unfettered growth “have sealed a Belgium-sized section of Texas grassland beneath asphalt, concrete, and land”. When Hurricane Harvey dumped more than 100bn tons of water on the state in 2017, the water had nowhere to go.But if Paved Paradise is an indictment of what parking has done to the modern American city, it’s also an invitation to imagine what else is possible. In 2011, when the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation moved 1,200 employees to a new headquarters in Seattle, it began charging for on-site parking while offering free bike lockers and transit cards. The share of workers who drove to work fell from 90% to 34% in six years. In Paris, officials have removed thousands of curbside parking spaces, including in front of some 200 schools.Considering the New York proposal to convert curbside parking into trash containers, Grabar asked me to imagine a city with functional sanitation. “[Imagine] if the city said, ‘We found a way to create 150,000 extra parking spaces, but we’re going to throw the trash all over the sidewalk. You’re gonna have to walk through it, and there’s going to be a ton of rats,’” he said, describing the current state of affairs.“I don’t think anyone would say that’s a better system.”

In the capital, Hanoi, street lights are being turned on 30 minutes later and turned off 30 minutes earlier than usual, the ministry said. Half the street lights along some major thoroughfares and in public parks have been completely turned off.“Authorities in many provinces and cities have taken measures to save energy to ensure stable and safe electricity supplies,” the ministry said in a statement.Office buildings and shopping malls in cities, including the tourist hotspot Da Nang, have also been asked halve the energy use of their outdoor lighting systems, while people have been urged to use air conditioning only when necessary and to turn off electronics that are not in use.Globally, 2022 was one of the hottest years on record, and the past eight years were collectively the hottest documented by modern science. Scientists have warned of higher temperatures to come.Last week, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) chief, Petteri Taalas, said the combination of a warming El Niño that is expected to develop in the coming months and human-induced climate change would “push global temperatures into uncharted territory”.Taalas warned of “far-reaching repercussions for health, food security, water management and the environment”.The very high temperatures recorded across Asia have prompted fears about a possible drought conditions, as well as causing disruption to education. Earlier this month, the Philippines permitted schools in Quezon City, the country’s most populous city, to shorten their hours due to the extreme heat, while in April at least two states in India ordered schools to close for a week. In May, Malaysia permitted children to wear casual clothing rather than uniform at school during the hot weather, and halted outdoor activities.Maximiliano Herrera, a climatologist and weather historian who regularly reports record temperatures on Twitter, said the heatwave affecting Asia was “arguably the worst tropical heatwave in world climatic history” in terms of its intensity of temperatures, the its geographical spread and the length of time for it has lasted.Monthly and all-time records have been broken across south-east Asia, including in Vietnam, where 44.1C was recorded earlier this month at Tuong Duong in Nghệ An province.Herrera said the extreme temperatures in the region were not over yet. “The worst might have yet to come, at least for some areas like Yunnan [south-west China],” he said.TopicsVietnamExtreme weatherAsia PacificnewsReuse this contentMore on this storyMore on this storyNoodle vendor who parodied Salt Bae jailed in Vietnam for ‘anti-state propaganda’1d agoVietnam records highest ever temperature of 44.1C7 May 2023Vietnam president quits amid anti-corruption drive17 Jan 2023Vietnamese boy trapped in 35-metre concrete pillar dies4 Jan 2023Vietnamese man extradited to Germany over oil executive kidnapping2 Jun 2022At least 13 people dead after tourist boat sinks off Vietnam coast26 Feb 2022Funeral for Thich Nhat Hanh held in Vietnam29 Jan 2022Thich Nhat Hanh, revered Zen Buddhist monk and peace activist, dies at 9522 Jan 2022Most viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Donna Lu@donnadluThu 25 May 2023 16.00 BSTLast modified on Fri 26 May 2023 11.24 BSTA major global deep ocean current has slowed down by approximately 30% since the 1990s as a result of melting Antarctic ice, which could have critical consequences for Earth’s climate patterns and sea levels, new research suggests.Known as the Southern Ocean overturning circulation, the global circulation system plays a key role in influencing the Earth’s climate, including rainfall and warming patterns. It also determines how much heat and carbon dioxide the oceans store.Melting Antarctic ice predicted to cause rapid slowdown of deep ocean current by 2050Read moreScientists warn that its slowdown could have drastic impacts, including increasing sea levels, altering weather patterns and depriving marine ecosystems of vital nutrients.“Changes in the overturning circulation are a big deal,” said the study’s co-author, Dr Steve Rintoul, an oceanographer and expert on the Southern Ocean at the Australian government’s Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO).The climate crisis: A three-week masterclass with academics, journalists and activistsRead more“It’s something that is a concern because it touches on so many aspects of the Earth, including climate, sea level, and marine life.”The finding comes months after modelling, which Rintoul was involved in, that predicted a 40% slowdown in the circulation by 2050.“The model projections of rapid change in the deep ocean circulation in response to melting of Antarctic ice might, if anything, have been conservative,” Rintoul said. “We’re seeing changes have already happened in the ocean that were not projected to happen until a few decades from now.”The overturning circulation originates in the cold and dense waters that plunge down deep off Antarctica’s continental shelf and spread to ocean basins globally. It brings oxygen to the deep ocean and returns nutrients to the surface ocean.“What’s driven the slowing is the fact that that dense shelf water is not as dense as it used to be because it’s not as salty as it used to be,” Rintoul said.The melting of Antarctic glacial ice, the researchers found, has resulted in additional freshwater, increasing buoyancy.The study looked specifically at changes in overturning circulation in the Australian Antarctic basin, but the researchers believe a “circumpolar slowdown” is occurring.“The Australian Antarctic basin is the best ventilated of all the deep basins in the sense that it gets more … oxygen-rich water getting to the the bottom,” Rintoul said. “The signal in that basin might provide a kind of early warning of changes that might happen around Antarctica.”Dr Ariaan Purich of Monash University, who was not involved in the research, said the Australian Antarctic basin was downstream of the region in Antarctica experiencing the greatest melt of ice shelves and loss of land ice. “In that sense, it makes it an important region to study to see these meltwater impacts on the ocean circulation.”Purich described the paper as significant for providing observational evidence for the slowing of large-scale ocean overturning as a result of the melting Antarctic ice sheet.“We’re now seeing lots of lines of evidence that this melt water isn’t only increasing sea levels – it’s affecting the climate system in lots of different ways,” Purich said.,“This is pretty confronting. These are big changes that are happening in Antarctica that can affect our global climate.”Between 1994 and 2017, there was a net slowdown in the circulation by 0.8 sverdrups per decade, the study found. One sverdrup is a flow rate equivalent to 1 million cubic metres per second.The researchers found a temporary increase in the overturning circulation between 2009 and 2017, as a result of increased sea ice formation. “That was enough to compensate for the melt from glacial melt for a few years,” Rintoul said.“We expect in the longer term that while there will be ups and downs related to sea ice formation, the overall trend is that Antarctica is losing more ice, is melting more, and that will gradually slow down this overturning circulation.“Unless we act soon we will commit ourselves to changes that we’d really rather avoid,” he said. “We need to act to reduce emissions and we need to do everything we can as fast as we can.”The study, whose first author is Kathryn Gunn of the CSIRO and the University of Southampton, was published in the journal Nature Climate Change.TopicsScienceClimate crisisAntarcticaOceansnewsReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedWorldUKCoronavirusClimate crisisEnvironmentScienceGlobal developmentFootballTechBusinessObituariesNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Photograph: Joss Barratt/Sixteen FilmsCannes 2023ReviewThe Old Oak review – Ken Loach’s fierce final call for compassion and solidarityA northern pub landlord confronts locals’ hostility towards Syrian immigrants in Loach’s latest – and possibly last – piece of politically trenchant cinemaPeter Bradshaw@PeterBradshaw1Fri 26 May 2023 19.23 BSTA decade or so ago, the rumour was that Ken Loach was getting ready to quit. Then began a new parade of Conservative prime ministers in this country, each shiftier and more mediocre than the last; Loach decided he had more to say and do after all. What followed was a blaze of energy, anger and productivity culminating in a remarkable late surge – in fact, a trilogy, of which this might come to be seen as the final episode. Working with his regular collaborator, the screenwriter Paul Laverty, Loach has been taking on issues and stories that you don’t see on the TV news or on glitzy streaming services, and showed that film-makers could actually intervene in the real world. Loach got questions about poverty and austerity asked in parliament; he moved the dial.Loach has also sought out the painful and unfashionable subjects, marching to where the gunfire has been loudest. With I, Daniel Blake it was the vivisectional experiment of austerity; with Sorry We Missed You it was the serfdom of the gig economy. Now, in The Old Oak, it is that ugly phenomenon from which London’s liberal classes have turned away in sorrowing distaste: immigrants housed in hostels all over the UK who are being abused and attacked by local people radicalised by social media.But Loach does not attack the “deplorables” of the white working class; on the contrary. Thinking globally, acting locally, he treats them sympathetically; they are the same as their victims. Market forces and geopolitical interests have put them in the same position as the wretched Syrian incomers whom they have been encouraged to hate to feel good about themselves.Ebla Mari as Yara.Pub landlord TJ Ballantyne (Dave Turner) is suffering a Job-like ordeal: he is divorced and depressed with a grownup son who doesn’t speak to him. The Old Oak is the name of his pub, the one community meeting place in a deprived north-eastern former mining town – and it is in dire need of refurbishment. (In this the film has echoes of an earlier Loach work, Jimmy’s Hall.) His regulars are seething with rage, livid at the collapse in house prices and brooding over YouTube videos about immigrants. They are seething at neighbouring properties being bought for a song by real estate companies and rented out exploitatively, thus collapsing the value of the homes they’d hoped would effectively cushion their retirement, and strip-mining value from the community. Then a busload of terrified Syrians arrives and the tension gets worse.The film shows that TJ makes what is possibly a strategic mistake: angry white locals ask him to open up the pub’s long-dormant back room as a meeting place to air their grievances. He refuses, but tactlessly allows it to act as the venue for a food bank-style community supper for both locals and Syrians, including Yara (Ebla Mari). She is a young Syrian woman housed with her brother and elderly mother, desperate for news of her father, imprisoned by the Assad regime.TJ finds a gentle friendship with her, sneeringly misinterpreted by some drinkers. There is a very moving scene where he takes her to see Durham Cathedral; she is deeply affected by listening to the choir and awed by the thousand-year-old building. She ponders the fact that she will never again see the temples at Palmyra, built by the Romans and destroyed by Islamic State. And Loach and Laverty fervently argue that through solidarity and a recognition of real interests, British people can naturally show empathy to immigrants and refugees.‘My short term memory is fading and my eyesight is not what it was’: Ken Loach takes his last film to CannesRead moreAs ever, Loach shows himself to be the John Bunyan of social realism – or perhaps the Gerrard Winstanley or William Everard of the cinema. He is the fierce plain-speaker of political indignation with a style that is unironised and unadorned, shot by Robbie Ryan in simple daylit fashion, using first-timers and non-professionals in front of the camera. It is a film-making language utterly without the cynical twang that is de rigueur for everyone else. Thirty years ago, the mischief makers of Lars von Trier and Dogme 95 were talking about radical minimalism. They didn’t stick to it; Loach did. I hope that this isn’t Loach’s final film, but if it is, he has concluded with a ringing statement of faith in compassion for the oppressed.

Photograph: Kailey Schwerman/ShowtimeTelevision & radioMove over Lord of the Flies! How TV’s Yellowjackets has taken survival horror to new heightsThis tale of teen cannibalism is utterly thrilling, wonderfully acted and is increasingly becoming bone-chillingly bleak. It’s like the show’s creators are trying to one-up William GoldingLeila LatifFri 26 May 2023 13.00 BSTLast modified on Fri 26 May 2023 13.52 BSTJean-Paul Sartre claimed that hell is other people. Season two of Yellowjackets shows that being trapped with other people doesn’t just put you in hell – but plunges you ever deeper into its bowels.The first season tortured its characters with blackly comic aplomb, but in its follow-up, things have become so spectacularly dire for our ensemble that it is hard to believe this ever felt like a playful respite from the frequently dour realm of prestige TV. And that is no criticism of the show. The conclusion has been utterly thrilling. It remains brilliantly written, wonderfully acted and continually surprising, but it has evolved. It no longer relies on a litany of juicy little mysteries and soapy twists, but takes its power from making the audience sit with the characters they’ve come to love and truly absorb what it is to lose all hope.Yellowjackets premiered to modest fanfare and became something of a sleeper hit. Great word of mouth and strong reviews saw the audience grow, and by the end of the first season, it had been described by the Guardian as “the most fun TV show in for ever”. Half of the show was set in the Canadian wilderness in the 1990s, where a group of teen girls in the Yellowjackets soccer team survive a plane crash, destined, as we soon learn, to be trapped there for 19 months. In the opening scene, we are shown they are on the path to damnation, resulting in teammates being skewered and eaten with dark, ritualistic fervour.Ricci as ‘delightfully sociopathic amateur detective Misty’. Photograph: Kailey Schwerman/ShowtimeIn the present day, we follow four of the survivors: unfulfilled housewife Shauna (Melanie Lynskey), self-destructive addict Nat (Juliette Lewis), rising star politician (who occasionally finds herself up a tree chewing on her own hand) Taissa (Tawny Cypress) and delightfully sociopathic amateur detective Misty (Christina Ricci). All are finding life in the real world almost as messed up as it was watching their friends die in the wilderness. This drama was always dark; in season one the sweetest member of the team literally exploded while looking at her teddy bear, a girl watched her lover’s face being ripped apart by wolves and we saw a family pet meet the worst possible end. But it was raucous fun to watch the withering putdowns of the teen girls picking on each other’s insecurities, the mystery of who or what was the “antler queen”, Shauna’s steamy affair with a hot artist, and her husband’s hilarious horror at discovering that she hadn’t just been going to a very demanding book club.A clear inspiration for the show is Lord of the Flies, the classic novel about a group of children going feral on a remote desert island, imagining a monster called “the beast” and eventually killing two of their party. Where season one depicted a similar coming-of-age into brutality, watching season two, it feels like the creators looked at William Golding’s portrayal of savagery and asked him to hold their beer.The last three episodes saw the girls breeze past feral into demonic. What they agonised over, or did under the influence of hallucinogenic mushrooms in season one, has become the status quo. Van, previously comic relief, is now a cold, unfeeling shell, plainly expressing that they feel not one ounce of guilt about their actions. But the characters are still worth rooting for, and having sat with their pain for two seasons, we can see their humanity even when they cannot.Melanie Lynskey as Shauna, left, and Warren Kole as her husband, Jeff. Photograph: Colin Bentley/APThe ending of the first season, where Jackie’s body was discovered by her best friend, Shauna, after she had inadvertently condemned her to freeze to death, was dark. But season two’s final moments make them look like the good old days. Karyn Kusama, the director of blood-soaked vampire movie Jennifer’s Body (and of the Yellowjackets pilot), directed a nihilistic finale, capping off a final three episodes of the season that have slowly evolved into some of the most bone-chillingly bleak programming in recent memory, yet remained so inventive that it was no chore to take in its horrors. It’s hard to imagine any other show able to languish in such existential dread but punctuate it with musical numbers and the sweet budding romance between two quirky sociopaths, played with unhinged charm by Elijah Wood and Christina Ricci.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to What's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and exclusive features in your inbox every MondayPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Our characters have little reason to feel optimistic in the past or present, and in its final act, a return to fun may seem imminent, but Yellowjackets retains its power to shock. It’s hard to imagine what could give this tragic ensemble the strength to go on in season three (the creators say they have mapped out five series), given how much season two ups the stakes. Winter may have been long and arduous, but the prospect of the long wait to find out what could possibly happen next for the characters – probably made longer by the present writer’s strike – feels nearly as cruel. As the season concludes, you may think you are in hell, but things might just be getting warmed up.

Photograph: Zoonar GmbH/AlamyFictionChamber of horrors: the best and worst Westminster insider novels Whips by Cleo Watson is nothing new – politicos have forever tried their hand at fiction. We take a referendum on the good, the bad and the scandalousElla CreamerFri 26 May 2023 17.30 BSTLast modified on Fri 26 May 2023 17.53 BSTFrom hostile briefings and spad skulduggery to extramarital sex, there’s never been any shortage of bad behaviour in Westminster. But political scandal also makes brilliant fodder for novels. Corrupt, egomaniacal characters are natural-born protagonists. The historic corridors of parliament provide a cloistered, detail-rich setting. A culture of secrecy creates inevitable tension and intrigue. None of this goes unnoticed by the leagues of politicians, aides and journalists who pass through the system, watching the sagas unfold first-hand, and then decide to write novels about it.There are many reasons why ex-politicos turn to fiction. An attempt to hold on to the limelight. Cashing in with a potboiler. A childhood dream to write a book. A genuine interest in the novel as an art form. Boredom. Whatever the explanation, the insider-to-novelist pipeline is nothing new: Michael Dobbs published the first novel in his House of Cards trilogy in 1989 after falling out with Margaret Thatcher, for whom he was chief of staff.On Thursday, the subgenre gained a new addition: Whips by Cleo Watson, Boris Johnson’s former aide and ally of Dominic Cummings. To mark the release, we’ve chosen the good, the bad and the average novels about Westminster dished up by insiders over the last 10 years, from the bonkbuster to the taut political thriller.Landslide winThe Friends of Harry Perkins by Chris MullinThis sequel to A Very British Coup by the former MP for Sunderland South is set in post-Brexit Britain. Published in 2019, parts of the novel feel clairvoyant: “Brexit Britain was a gloomy place. True, the Armageddon that some had prophesied had not occurred, but neither had the economic miracle promised by the Brexiteers. The value of the pound had fallen steadily against the euro, the dollar and the yuan.”The book is prescient in other ways too. Labour loses election after election (“disaffection ran high in what were once Labour’s northern strongholds”), and after the death of Harry Perkins – a Corbynite, Tony Benn-like avatar – the party moves to the centre, and a Starmeresque figure ascends the ranks.Anatomy of a Scandal by Sarah VaughanThis Westminster-adjacent courtroom drama centres on a sexual misconduct case: James, an Eton- and Oxford-educated junior Home Office minister and best friend of the PM, is accused of rape by his aide, Olivia. Vaughan successfully renders the complex perspectives of the women surrounding James – including Sophie, his wife, and Kate, the QC prosecuting his case – offering an incisive take on institutional male privilege in politics and law. (The book has also been adapted into a Netflix miniseries.)Whips by Cleo WatsonThe Jilly Cooper-esque satire from the former Johnson adviser features an abundance of sex and scandal in Westminster. In her author’s note, Watson stresses that her characters are not based on real politicians. “Honestly, not everything’s about you,” she quips. This becomes hard to buy as Watson introduces characters such as the womanising Percy Cross, a former PM who resigns after a scandal and goes on to write columns for The Telegraph and “poorly researched hagiographies of his favourite historical figures.” Hmm.Hung parliamentThe House by Tom Watson and Imogen RobertsonFormer deputy leader of the Labour party Tom Watson gets some points just for printing the name of his co-writer on the cover of his thriller. And the work of novelist Imogen Robertson shows: two convincingly drawn political enemies and former housemates, Owen and Philip, are at the centre of a plot that shifts nimbly between 2008 and 2022 as the pair’s past catches up with them.The story is partly set in the Covid era and opens with Philip making a blunder in the Commons, supporting a public memorial to “celebrate” the deaths of frontline workers. He meant to say “commemorate,” of course, and apologises, but already he “can see the newspaper and social media headlines next to a picture of his own sweating face.” Shortly after, he has the urge to “strike” Owen, sending his “owlish glasses flying”. Such inner monologues pepper the book – and, however embittered and vengeful, feel satisfyingly honest.The Whistleblower by Robert PestonThe protagonist of the ITV politics editor’s debut novel often feels like a self-portrait: Gil Peck is a ruthless reporter for the “Financial Chronicle” (read: Financial Times, where Peston worked for years), and shares the author’s north London background and Labour heritage.Set in 1997, the Conservative government is failing as a modernising Labour leader rises. Peck is confidently covering it all until he learns that his estranged sister, an ambitious civil servant, has been killed in a bike accident. But Peck believes there’s more to the story – that mystery drives this compulsive read.Open Arms by Vince CableThree months after becoming leader of the Liberal Democrats, Cable published Open Arms. Set between Westminster and Mumbai, the novel follows MP Kate Thompson as she falls for an Indian billionaire in the arms technology business while on a work trip. The premise is strong, but Cable’s “thriller” suffers from a chronic lack of suspense.Vote of no confidenceHead of State by Andrew MarrEnter the Brexit thriller. Published in 2014, the novel looks ahead to a 2017 EU membership referendum. The PM drops dead days before the poll, and those surrounding him decide to conceal his demise so as not to lose the vote. The novel has pluses: sardonic humour, insider detail, recognisable faces (Rory Bremner, Ian Hislop and Nick Robinson) and thinly veiled others (Fraser Nelson as “Nelson Fraser”). Yet, the storytelling is weak, and the plot becomes increasingly absurd.The Madness of July by James NaughtieUnlike other books on this list that redeem themselves with insidery gossip, the former Today presenter’s spy novel, set in the 70s, does the opposite. “Vagueness seeps through The Madness of July like fog, leaving the reader disoriented and decidedly unthrilled,” wrote John O’Connell in the Guardian. “We are never told whether the government is Labour or Tory, and there are no descriptions of process.”Seventy-Two Virgins by Boris JohnsonThis novel breaks the 10-year rule, as it was published in 2004, but it is too bad to leave off the list. The plot covers just a few hours in Westminster, as a group of suicide bombers target the visiting US president. Throughout the book, Johnson liberally employs racist and sexist language.TopicsFictionPolitics booksBoris JohnsonVince CableChris MullinTom WatsonRobert PestonfeaturesReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedBooksMusicTV & radioArt & designFilmGamesClassicalStageNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

A short film was shown about the outrage of kidnapping and “Russifying” Ukrainian children from captured territories.As so often, the festival featured its big names, its silverback gorillas and its favoured blue-chip directors, although it annoyed many who couldn’t be included in the club itself: the main competition list. But it wasn’t such a great festival for the Depp family. Johnny was roundly mocked for his torpid, waxy portrayal of Louis XV in Maïwenn’s Jeanne Du Barry and his daughter, Lily-Rose Depp, got an awful panning for her TV series The Idol.On the other hand, the much-imitated Wes Anderson is adored by Cannes and his new film Asteroid City played very well, and might even have widened the fanbase a little. Turkish auteur Nuri Bilge Ceylan made a garrulous, ruminative, humane movie in About Dry Grasses. Aki Kaurismaki’s deadpan comedy Fallen Leaves was joyfully hugged by Cannes festivalgoers to their collective soul. Veteran Marco Bellocchio made a terrific drama about antisemitism in Kidnapped. Ken Loach made another heartfelt movie about inequality and injustice in The Old Oak. Even the late Jean-Luc Godard was included by virtue of showing for the first time his Drôle de Guerre, the trailer for a film which will never get made. But the legendary Spanish director Victor Erice, making his first film for over 30 years with his enigmatic drama Close Your Eyes, was publicly furious not to be included in the competition.In summary though, the competition selection was very good, with some outstanding movies. All of Cannes is buzzing about Jonathan Glazer’s icily brilliant and very disturbing Holocaust drama The Zone of Interest, based on the novel by Martin Amis, who very sadly died before he could be aware of this triumph. Did Amis ever get a chance to see the finished film? Let’s hope so. Justine Triet’s courtroom murder drama Anatomy of a Fall was a terrifically tense movie, reminding me of Billy Wilder’s Witness for the Prosecution. Alice Rohrwacher has made a glorious film starring Josh O’Connor as an archaeologist-turned-ancient-grave-robber. Jude Law stole the show with his roistering turn as Henry VIII in the Tudor intrigue drama Firebrand, opposite Alicia Vikander’s Catherine Parr – although many of us wondered if he had used a buttock stunt double for one particularly gruesome sex scene. Hirokazu Kore-eda’s Monster was a marvellously complex and intricate piece of work, Ramata-Toulaye Sy’s Banel e Adama was a visually wonderful film about love and – not actually competing for the Palme d’Or – Martin Scorsese’s Killers of the Flower Moon was a resoundingly tragic drama about the erasure of the Native Americans from the US.So here are my (infallible) Cannes prize predictions, the films that I think will probably will win, together with a Cannes edition of my yearly “Braddies” – for Cannes prize categories that don’t exist, but should.Palme d’Or The Zone of Interest (dir.

@siancainFri 26 May 2023 16.00 BST“Cunt” is not a word that Americans bandy about lightly. So when Amazon gave the green light to Australian comedy writers Kate McLennan and Kate McCartney to start work on their “feminist noir comedy” series Deadloch, it was clear that they would have to convince the US media giant on a key part of the Australian vernacular.Kate McLennan and Kate McCartney: the funniest things we have ever seen (on the internet)Read moreIt led to a document that McLennan and McCartney call “The Cunt Manifesto”.“It was quite controversial,” says McCartney. “It was a real talking point. We all had a hand in creating this document that had footnotes and citations, where we explained the Australian cultural context for using ‘cunt’ and how borderline innocuous it can be. We explained how it fit in the rhythm of our writing. We invoked Shakespeare. And Amazon read it and said, ‘that makes sense’.”McLennan, 43, and McCartney, 42, seemingly arrived out of nowhere when the Katering Show, a vicious parody of cooking YouTubers, took off online in 2015. Each episode, now watched by millions around the world, revealed the slightly unhinged, savage nature of their humour, as the pair brightly delivered lines like, “Fun fact: beetroots are potatoes filled with blood!” or as McLennan used her (real) placenta to cook what she called a “plasagna”.McLennan and McCartney were suddenly the most electrifying writing duo since, well, Lennon and McCartney.The Thermomix episode of the Katering Show.Their follow-up show Get Krack!n, which aired on the ABC, skewered the bright, hyper-caffeinated world of breakfast television: in the style of Australian morning mainstays Mel and Kochie, McLennan and McCartney flit between topics like assisted suicide and sarongs, their bright smiles becoming rictus as they introduce yet another stupid segment.Under the gags, though, Get Krack!n thrummed with a ferocious anger about how women are treated on TV, which is a theme also threaded through their new show Deadloch, which premieres around the world next week.

The crime drama comedy follows homicide detective Dulcie Collins (Kate Box) as she tries to solve a series of murders in her small Tasmanian town. All of the victims are male, a detail that immediately sets it apart. “This sort of thing, you sort of presume it’s a woman,” the (male) police commissioner says offhandedly of the murder case, before handing it to Dulcie. Dulcie will go on to endure gossiping locals demanding grizzly details, incompetent colleagues (Nina Oyama and Tom Ballard), and the arrival of Eddie Redcliffe (Madeline Sami), a rough-as-guts investigator sent from Darwin to help.The trailer for Deadloch.McLennan and McCartney had the idea for Deadloch around eight years ago; so much time has passed since then that they both seem surprised by the possibility that people will actually watch it. For reasons unknown to either, both began watching scores of crime dramas while at home with new babies. McCartney recommended Broadchurch to McLennan who, knowing actor Olivia Colman was in it, thought it might be a comedy.“So I sat down and watched it and went, ohhh this is not funny,” she says. “But there were still elements of Colman’s character that were really funny, because she’s such a gifted comic. So we thought, what if we took a series like that and dialed the comedy up, just a touch, just to see where it will land?”Bridgerton, Muppets Mayhem and Ten Pound Poms: what’s new to streaming in Australia this MayRead moreThe pair called Deadloch “Funny Broadchurch” for ages – “but without the paedophilia; it’s very hard to put a funny spin on that”, says McLennan – until they found their title in McLennan’s home town. Mortlake, Victoria, population: 1,372 – a town that didn’t even have lake until 1988, when they built one.“I’ve always wanted to write something about country towns because I think they’re really fascinating, they’re a microcosm of everything else,” McLennan says. “They’re also quite weird and dark.”Both saw the potential of Tasmania in particular: as the bodies pile high, Deadloch is wrestling with its new reputation as an arty, foodie heaven for rich mainlanders. The town’s winter festival – not dissimilar to Hobart’s Dark Mofo – riles up some of the locals, who remember what Deadloch was like before the “festival of tit art”. Some characters live in caravans, unable to afford the creeping rents. Gentrification, as McCartney puts it, “is always just one store full of nick-nacks away”.“What do you do with those older industries that were once the lifeblood of a town, that usually involve pillaging the environment in some way? And there is an undeniable, financial benefit to going through gentrification – but people get left behind,” McLennan says. “We wanted to write about all sides.”Instead of flying in and out during the pandemic, most of the cast and crew relocated to Hobart. McLennan and McCartney lived there for almost six months with their families. On breaks in filming, the cast and crew would go out together to pumpkin festivals or pie-eating competitions. (“The prize was a pie,” McCartney says, delighted.)Madeleine Sami as Eddie Redcliffe and Kate Box as Dulcie Collins. Photograph: Amazon StudiosAside from topic or tone, what makes Deadloch most different from their previous work most is that McLennan or McCartney do not appear in it. “We have retreated into our normal selves over the last couple years,” McLennan says, which McCartney translates as: “Going full bridge troll.”Deadloch was initially a more direct parody of the crime dramas they’d been watching, but as the pair grew more ambitious, the show morphed into something akin to the real thing – just with more laughs. Get Krack!n had left them “slightly broken”, and desperate to make something different.“The world of morning television is such an aggressive, ugly world – we wanted to make something that looked cinematic and beautiful,” McLennan says.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Saved for LaterFree weekly newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Amazon leapt on the idea, read “The Cunt Manifesto”, and Deadloch was greenlit. Crucially, the streamer wanted an Australian show that felt Australian, not something about Australia for Americans, which the pair liked. But writing eight hour-long episodes was a steep learning curve. McLennan, for one, used to get “very defensive” about feedback: “When I got notes through, I would just get really angry.”“You’d go bright red and stay bright red for a couple of hours,” McCartney says.“I’d just fume,” McLennan sighs. “Whereas now I read notes and go, ‘No, that’s fair enough.’”“I think that comes with experience,” McCartney says. “And also–”“Medication,” they sing, perfectly in sync.Kate Box, Madeleine Sami, Tom Ballard, Nina Oyama and Naarah.

Both women had spent years working in comedy: by the 2000s, McCartney, increasingly dispirited by being spoken over by men in writing rooms, temporarily left comedy to work in animation instead. At one point, McLennan voiced a character in an animation McCartney worked on.Get Krack!n's season finale was the most nourishing despair I have felt in a long time | Alison WhittakerRead more“Comedy was so brutal that it made me think I was not good at it,” McCartney says. “Sometimes, my ideas probably weren’t very good. But I was also always in a room full of white straight dudes who just didn’t have the same experience as me. If you don’t have a mate in the room, who can see why something could be funny or valuable, it’s an uphill battle.”It wasn’t until 2011 that McLennan and McCartney properly met. Over a bottle of wine, they realised they had finally found their other person in the room. “We were like, ‘Oh, this is something we really need to take care of’,” McLennan says. “And then I kind of made you be my friend.”“And now we have a WhatsApp filled with crocodile attacks,” McCartney says happily.They now live two minutes from each other, throw family dinners, and their children are best friends. Even after spending a couple years in each other’s pockets, the day Deadloch wrapped they went for a drink to immediately discuss ideas for the next season.‘Comedy was so brutal’: McLennan and McCartney.

That’s your love language.”“My love language is videos of Bernese mountain dogs,” McCartney replies.

Photograph: YellowBellyTheatreInterview‘My instinct is to look for the gag’: Martha Watson Allpress takes Lady Dealer to the Edinburgh fringeMark FisherThe writer of the acclaimed Patricia Gets Ready… returns with a lockdown-inspired comedy drama about a drug dealer having a power cutFri 26 May 2023 10.12 BSTThe trigger for a play can be many things: a moral dilemma or a political event, a true-life story or a misheard anecdote. Martha Watson Allpress has taken a less trodden path. The inspiration for her new play, Lady Dealer, came from her clashing taste in music.This was during the pandemic when her playlist included Ezra Collective, a favourite from the local south London jazz scene. She loved their responsiveness and cool collaborative energy. At the same time, she was obsessed by the chaotic intensity of the Beastie Boys. She adored the meticulous collage of samples and beats created by the hip-hop pioneers, a sound she describes as “carnage”.In the absence of gigs at that time, Watson Allpress yearned for the ensemble spirit of one and the direct attack of the other. “The dichotomy of those two feelings – chaos and calm, collaboration and isolation – manifested itself as a drug dealer having a power cut,” she says.That drug dealer is Charly, a broken-hearted black-market seller whose routine – and sense of identity – are upturned when the electricity goes off and her phone battery dies. Can a dealer without a mobile be said to be a dealer at all?“A drug dealer is on the fringe of the world but also central to it,” says Watson Allpress, who grew up in rural Lincolnshire and has worked as an actor since her teens. “Every person of my age in London has a drug dealer on their phone or knows a person that knows a person. So a dealer is entwined in nearly everyone’s lives, but not a part of them – you’re not going to get invited to the birthdays.”Although Charly is a Beastie Boys fan, Lady Dealer is not about music. Nonetheless, the playwright’s love for the form seeps in. “It has a specific language and rhythm that is influenced by the music,” she says. “It fell out as a poem. Charly is reaching for an expression she can’t find, but in her head, this is the tempo, the intellect and the rhythm she has.”Every person of my age in London has a drug dealer on their phone or knows a person that knows a personPart of Paines Plough’s Edinburgh fringe season, Lady Dealer follows the playwright’s five-star debut Patricia Gets Ready (for a Date With the Man That Used to Hit Her), which turned heads at London’s Vault festival and again in the socially distanced Edinburgh fringe of 2021. What distinguished that play was its refusal to play the victim card. Yes, it was about a woman who had been assaulted by her partner, but it was also about someone who was a bit of a laugh. It did not hold back on the fury, nor was it all bleak.“I get that it is a gut-punch of a show but I like that it is funny,” says the playwright. “That’s what we do: we go through really shit times then we have a laugh about it, because otherwise it’s just too dark and depressing. There has to be space for hope and joy.”She is now developing a television version, building out from the monologue to embrace the family, friends and colleagues in Patricia’s life: “It’s like sending a child to school and saying, ‘Oh they’ve got friends!’ and seeing them blossom as a full person.”She is pleased with its progress but careful not to be defined by it. “Patricia was based on a relationship I had when I was very young, but an element was sheer fiction,” she says about a play she started even before she enrolled at the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama at the age of 23. “I felt scared of the conflation of me and the character. My fear was I was going to get lost and my story, which I’d taken time to find peace with, was out in the world and people were going to understand it differently.”Patricia Gets Ready (for a Date With the Man That Used to Hit Her) review – bold and brilliantRead moreSidestepping that dilemma, the new play is personal without being autobiographical. “Lady Dealer is a product of a lockdown brain,” she says. “It’s about loneliness and isolation – with jokes! Theatre that was created during the pandemic has a tenderness to it. I went through the wringer of being angry with the world, but you get so exhausted being angry that the radical thing, the real punk move, is to be relentlessly soft with yourself. I’m seeing so many characters now that have this tiny vulnerability, like a little bird. Charly in Lady Dealer doesn’t show that vulnerability easily but it’s there.”In its study of a woman who mistakes self-destruction for self-preservation, it oscillates, in characteristic style, between the dramatic and the comic. “I love the idea that you come in and it’s the exact opposite of what you thought the play was going to be,” she says. “My instinct is always to look for the gag – a joke is a nice way to say to the audience: ‘We’re all safe in this space’ – and there are so many gags in a female drug dealer. It’s endless.”

Its clientele of all ages and backgrounds is more diverse than the classic Paris restaurant scene and it has been described as a fine-dining revolution in France.“Food is the reflection of a society,” says its star chef, Mory Sacko, who at 28 won France’s first ever Michelin star for west and central African cuisine. “French society is evolving. There are lots of young people like me who are French but who have different origins and are proud of it … Palates are ready, mentalities are ready, to welcome a cuisine like mine in France.”Sacko, now 30, is currently France’s most famous chef – hailed not just for his daring combinations of French local produce with African recipes and Japanese seasoning, but described by food writers as “better than a politician” for promoting inclusivity in French culture and cuisine. Emmanuel Macron has called on him to cook for an important Africa-France summit.President Emmanuel Macron with Sacko before a dinner at the New Africa-France summit in Montpellier in October 2021. Photograph: Daniel Cole/AFP/Getty ImagesDuring the Covid pandemic in 2020, Sacko became a household name competing in France’s favourite TV cooking contest, Top Chef, which drew millions of lockdown viewers. He didn’t win but became wildly popular not only for his experimental dishes but, crucially, his gentle, humane attitude in the kitchen – the opposite of the stereotypical shouty chef of old – as well as his background. Sacko grew up with his Malian parents, a builder and a cleaner, in a family of nine children in social housing in Seine-et-Marne, east of Paris. At 14, he began training at hotel school and worked as a chef in several of Paris’s finest hotel restaurants.Sacko used his lockdown TV fame to open his restaurant, MoSuke, named in homage to Yasuke, a former slave who became the first Black samurai in Japan. The menu subtly combines three influences – the west and central African classic recipes cooked by his mother in his childhood, his personal interest in Japanese food, which began with his love of Manga as a child, and his very classical French chef’s training. His dishes have included Breton sole with attiéké, a cassava semolina, fermented with natural acidity “that people eat on the pavement or in bars in Ivory Coast”, as well as new interpretations of traditional west African chicken yassa or beef in traditional mafé sauce.He sees a new interest in west African and central African gastronomy in France. “There’s change, there’s real curiosity, people want to try more. This cuisine had always faced a lot of prejudice and I honestly feel those prejudices are now very, very far away. In Paris, people no longer arrive saying west African cooking is greasy and rich, instead they’re very curious to discover the spices and recipes”.Winning the first Michelin star in France for west and central African food in 2021 was crucial to him. “It’s nice to be the first, but I hope I won’t be the only one. It’s important because when I was at hotel school, I didn’t see any starred Michelin chefs who looked like me, there weren’t any. I ate African cuisine as a child so I knew it was good, that wasn’t the issue. But it lacked figureheads to offer it in a way that pleased the restaurant guides and more western palates. Finally, we’re breaking a glass ceiling and I hope it will show young people that starred cuisine doesn’t have to be European or Asian.”Sacko on his TV show Cuisine Ouverte Photograph: FTVFor Sacko, French haute cuisine is a rare arena in France that gives equal opportunities regardless of race or background. His own team at MoSuke is young – in their 20s – and diverse.“People often ask me about racism, because I worked in top hotels from very young, and I say, no, in the kitchen the only thing looked at by the chef is whether you’re good or not. Black, Asian or white, what counts is your work.”Sacko promotes what he calls a “conversation” between cultures, but hates the term “fusion” food. He says: “That’s a barbaric concept suggesting that if anyone blends African and Japanese, it must mean sushi with an African sauce, which is absolutely not what we do. It’s not forced, it’s about a dialogue, and exchange … It might mean adding one ingredient or technique. For the mafé sauce, I do a classic recipe like my mum would do and at the very, very end add miso to season, but the miso isn’t there to say ‘Voilà, I’ve put something Japanese in!’ It brings its aromatic complexity – salt, but different to simply fine salt. So the Japanese product works in service of the African recipe and magnifies it.”Sacko continues to be a TV star in France with his series, Cuisine Ouverte, where he travels around French regions, celebrating local ingredients and recreating classic dishes against heritage backdrops. He also has a street food restaurant, Mosugo, with his own twist on burgers.He lives above the Mosuke restaurant and is always in the kitchen cooking for every service, greeting diners at their table. The eagerly awaited restaurant redesign was not just to expand the kitchen, but to make the simple decor more cosy.“I really want to welcome people and feed them here as I would at home,” he says. “It’s all about warmth, we don’t want anything cold or clinical in the service.”Feeding diners is something deeply personal, he ads. “Cooking is all about your personal story, that’s what I try to do – tell my story and pass on emotions through my dishes.”TopicsRestaurantsFranceEuropeAfricaFoodfeaturesReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Here are my tips on buying a swimsuitBuying a swimsuit that works for you means going to real shops and trying them onJess Cartner-Morley@JessC_MFri 26 May 2023 14.00 BSTMany women – me! Hi! – would rank shopping for a new swimsuit somewhere up there with having a smear test and filing a tax return on the scale of Fun Times.The changing room curtain is always four inches narrower than the doorframe. And oh, the shock of your almost-naked body displayed under supermarket lighting. Don’t even get me started on those sticky plastic gusset shields, eminently sensible yet somehow so depressingly undignified. Put simply, we can’t all be Martha Stewart – relaxed in a swimsuit, on the cover of say, Sports Illustrated.But you know what’s worse? Not having a swimsuit that works for you. And it is precisely because I don’t much like swimsuit shopping that I am the right person to tell you how to make it easier and – crucially – to end up with the perfect swimsuit for you.Sure, you could find an 19-year-old influencer who is all over-the-shoulder changing room bum selfies and “this gorgeous neon lime with keyhole cut outs will sure make me stand out on the beach!” but, really, how helpful is that?It is almost June and you need a swimsuit that works with the body you have nowFirst of all, I need you to promise me (and more importantly yourself) that this is not a self-flagellation exercise about your body. Working on having a fit, healthy body is a positive thing; standing in front of a mirror hating on yourself is not. It is almost June and you need a swimsuit that works with the body you have now, not a Sue Gray report into historical cheese-related misdemeanours.Next, tighten your focus. I only wear black swimsuits, because I have found that it is, counterintuitively perhaps, the most flattering colour for pale skin. Or maybe you love print, in which case look for the fun prints. Next, before you start looking at new stuff, if you have any old swimsuits at home, try them on. No matter if they are old and scraggy – that’s good, in fact, as it will focus your mind on the basic grammar of what does and doesn’t work. Does a scoop or racerback balance your proportions better? Do your boobs sit more comfortably in an adjustable halterneck or wired cups?Give your wardrobe the sartorial hit of dark chocolate it craves | Jess Cartner-MorleyRead moreRemember that when we see a woman in a swimsuit, what our brain appraises is 85% the woman and 15% the swimsuit. What I’m getting at is: don’t pay extra for what you aren’t actually getting. Many online retailers use a reasonably diverse cast of models nowadays. But I find that I, for one, am still hardwired wrong. Scrolling a page, my eyes lock on to the 20-something rather than the woman who actually looks like me. So real-life shopping in actual shops, despite the hard yards involved, is more efficient for me, because I have to try a swimsuit on me and I’m not distracted by what it looks like on someone else.You can get swimsuits built like shapewear these days, but more comfortable is a one-piece with fabric gathered at one side or ruched across the midsection, which blurs out your middle bit in a way that can help put self-consciousness at bay – Marks & Spencer have a good selection. Belted swimsuits don’t do you as much of a favour as you might think, I find; but a seam that sits between your waist and boobs will definitely make your legs look longer. Try Boden for this.If you need a swimsuit that has proper, bra-like boob support, then look for a cup and strap shape that is close to the shape of underwear you find most comfortable. Now is not the time to experiment with strapless balconettes. But you do want a one-piece that feels current, because looking out-dated is instantly ageing. Don’t panic: current doesn’t have to mean key-hole cut outs. A high-cut leg will make a simple one-piece feel more modern than a low, boy-short shape. For this, try Mango.Finding a swimsuit can feel like hard work but if you have a plan, it needn’t be an ordeal. And actually having a swimsuit you like wearing? That is cheering indeed.TopicsFashionJess Cartner-Morley on fashionSwimmingfeaturesReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedFashionFoodRecipesLove & sexHealth & fitnessHome & gardenWomenMenFamilyTravelMoneyNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Photograph: Vianney Le Caer/Invision/APFashion‘Bolder than ever’: Cannes fuses film and glamour in unofficial fashion weekIn risk-taking red carpet gowns, actors and supermodels attend parties and fashion shows hosted by likes of Versace and Naomi CampbellMorwenna FerrierFri 26 May 2023 16.34 BSTFirst published on Fri 26 May 2023 12.27 BSTAt night, the Croisette in Cannes is lit up by 1,500 dark pink LED lights. It happens all year. But during the film festival, which ends this weekend, these lights transform the boulevard into a red carpet. It’s where industry types with lanyards queue for parties, fashion types jostle to be seen, and fans on the blue chairs sit and watch – and it explains why the festival is fast becoming an unofficial fashion week.Cannes film festival is no stranger to high fashion. Entrance-making gowns and jewels are almost mandatory, particularly after the luxury jeweller Chopard redesigned the festival’s highest prize, the Palme d’Or, in 1998.But this year, it has prompted new levels of fashion hysteria – miles from the writers’ strike that has halted much of the film industry. Chopard and Donatella Versace have hosted fashion shows, Naomi Campbell had a model-heavy birthday party at Villa Julia on the seafront, and the former Vanity Fair editor Graydon Carter and the fashion house Celine held starry soirees at the exclusive Hotel du Cap-Eden-Roc. Even the films have high fashion baked in – the newly formed Saint Laurent Productions collaborated with Pedro Almodóvar on costumes for a short film A Strange Way of Life.‘People make the most of the steps’: Heidi Klum arrives for the screening of La Passion de Dodin Bouffant. Photograph: Valéry Hache/AFP/GettySpeaking before her show, Versace said: “[Cannes] it’s not just about film. It’s about culture – the actresses, the 60s, the glamour … It makes sense the two things should sit together.”“From a red carpet perspective, this feels like the first proper comeback post pandemic,” said Emma Spedding, Vogue’s acting executive fashion news and features editor, who describes the red carpet as “bolder than I ever remember seeing during an awards season”.At a film festival, you don’t need the “mass appeal of a classic ballgown or pretty princess dress”, said Spedding. Cannes likes to focus on old-world glamour or “anti-viral fashion”.The focus is on the film first, which has shifted the goalposts of what traditional red-carpet wear can be. With multiple events come multiple costume changes. Natalie Portman, who wore a “reimagined” Dior dress from 1949, told Vogue: “[Cannes fashion] seems to exist in this other era, where you can go really wild and extreme.”Natalie Portman wears a ‘reimagined’ Dior dress from 1949. Photograph: Gisela Schober/GettyIt’s also about the weather. Mixed skies aside, it’s the first big summer festival and the red carpet outside the Palais des Festivals is wide and short, so there’s more loitering. “People also make the most of the steps, wearing oversized gowns that [photograph well from behind] and tend to be more theatrical,” said Spedding.The festival is not without controversy. Isabelle Huppert, who appeared in a cancelled ad campaign, one of several that caused a scandal for Balenciaga by apparently referencing children and sex, wore two looks by the French brand. She is one of the biggest stars to wear something from its most recent collection post-scandal (by contrast not one celebrity wore the brand to the Oscars).Meanwhile, few batted an eyelid at Chanel’s decision to design costumes for Johnny Depp’s comeback film, Jeanne du Barry, which opened the festival.One fashion insider, who works for one of the most prominent labels on the Cannes red carpet, said: “I’ve noticed that the main US awards are more heavily financially backed – with fees of $100k+ for a red carpet look – so there is so much more pressure. Brands want to ensure there is a return on investment, with a focus on eye-catching looks rather than nice ones.”While red carpets tend towards stylist-led predictability and, at best, calculated risk-taking – think Kim Kardashian in Marilyn Monroe’s dress at the Met Gala – “at Cannes, there is less obligation [to wear certain brands and certain things]”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Fashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Photograph: Gisela Schober/GettyNaturally this closed-door glamour tends to attract people from outside its inner circle. Clarissa Rosato is a Brazilian designer who has come to Cannes “with a dress, an actress and a dream”. Walking up the Croisette on Tuesday night wearing one of her own designs, she described Cannes as a festival “led by haute culture”, not fashion.The American model Olivia Culpo arrives for the premiere of the film Asteroid City. Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images“At the US festivals, they wear beige and black – but there are more risk-takers here and you can get your clothes seen by more people,” she said. “This is why a lot of designers turn up.”Rosato’s dress, a diaphanous blue gown based on her artist mother’s artwork, was worn by the actor Priscila Vaz – and has been a hit. “We were getting stopped on the red carpet for 45 minutes,” Rosato said. “It was crazy!”Zarife Zgheib, a fashion expert for the Middle Eastern magazine Hia, thinks it’s important to separate the red carpet from the Croisette street style. Beyond the red carpet “there are a lot of people dressed up and behaving like celebrities, who just want to be a part of it. People really kill to be here.”TopicsFashionCannes film festivalCannes 2023FestivalsFranceIsabelle HuppertNatalie PortmanfeaturesReuse this contentMore on this storyMore on this storyJennifer Lawrence in step with trends by wearing flip-flops at Cannes8h agoJennifer Lawrence brings documentary about Afghan women to Cannes5d agoFrom Gareth Southgate to Taylor Swift: the continuing rise of the waistcoat7d agoScorsese and De Niro reunite at Cannes for Killers of the Flower Moon5d agoRishi Sunak and Akshata Murty take careful approach to G7 power dressing19 May 2023The Breaking Ice review – frozen emotion and sexual tension on North Korean border5d ago‘It’s come at the right time’: why fashion prizes have become the holy grail for struggling young designers19 May 2023May December review – Julianne Moore and Natalie Portman potent in Highsmithian drama5d agoA shopping guide to the best … mini bags19 May 2023Killers of the Flower Moon review – Scorsese’s remarkable epic about the bloody birth of America6d agoMost viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Naima BrownFri 26 May 2023 16.00 BSTLast modified on Fri 26 May 2023 16.53 BSTI still have waitressing dreams. In them, my section suddenly fills with patrons and I launch into action – fetching water, reciting menu specials, grabbing the booster seat for table one and the extra ice for table two. Stressful as it sounds, these aren’t nightmares. Sometimes, I really miss waitressing.I waited tables in places ranging from beachside cafes to high-end restaurants, on and off for 13 years. It taught me my most valuable lessons about human nature.Working front-of-house taught me to not rush someone when they just really need to talk, how to talk to anyone about anything and the ways to end a conversation with grace. It taught me to be patient, but also to pay attention to many things at once – so all those spinning plates don’t wind up broken on my section’s floor.The moment I knew: I dreamed up a character to cure my writer’s block. He saved my marriage tooRead moreThe best memories are the busy shifts that worked seamlessly, where everyone performed their roles flawlessly. It was deeply satisfying sitting at the bar with my co-workers at the end of a shift, counting up tips with a glass of wine in hand, vibrating with the relief that nothing had gone wrong. Those memories taught me teamwork.But it’s not just the good shifts that give you real insights. All happy customers are alike and each unhappy customer is unhappy in their own way.The waiter-customer power dynamic is complex and delicate. Learning to navigate somebody else’s disappointment, mitigating their expectations and entitlement, and receiving – calmly and without emotion – their full-throated ire if the steak is overcooked or the soup is too soupy, are priceless life skills.

My final table were an unhappy couple in their 50s. It’s an interesting thing, standing over people while they’re sitting. It may be the only part of the dance where the waiter has the upper hand psychologically.People transmit things when you’re standing above them. They tell you when they’re lonely and hungry for conversation. They tell you if they’re on a date and whether it’s going well. They tell you that they’re worried about the prices and quietly hope that when the split bill comes, you won’t make them pay for wine they didn’t drink. This last couple sent a clear signal: they loathed each other. He told me by openly eyeballing me. She told me with a glance that let me know she noticed.Dealing with unwanted flirtations while holding your professional ground is – unfortunately – baked into the service industry (and pretty much every industry), especially for women. In this case, I employed a well-worn strategy: directing all of my energy towards her, while ignoring him. “I’m on your side,” I telegraphed. “Solidarity!”Waiting tables ‘taught me to be patient, but also to pay attention to many things at once’: Brown’s hospitality years.But this particular night, it didn’t work. This woman, probably having had a gutful of her husband’s inappropriate behaviour, decided that tonight she’d take it out on me. The two of them proceeded to get plastered and treat everyone terribly.They stayed long after the “open” sign was off, as chairs around them were placed upside down on tables. I asked if I could bring them anything else. The woman insisted on a creme brulee – having been told already that the kitchen was closed. Through gritted teeth I made it happen anyway.Eventually she stumbled towards the bar where I was chatting with the bartender. She demanded more wine. I apologetically explained that not only was the bar closed, she was also past the limit where we could responsibly serve her. Then, the gloves came off:Her: “What’s your name? I want to talk to your manager!”Me: “My name is Naima Brown, and your name is drunk-arse bitch.”Oh, the look on her face. I’d broken the rules! I was a server. She was the customer. How dare I? This flashed across her face just before she vomited all over the carpet.I’ve never forgotten that night. I mined it heartily for a scene in my first novel. One of the main characters, Mara, throws her weight around in a restaurant. A decision that doesn’t end well for her.The Shot by Naima Brown.Today, I’d handle it differently. I aim for the Michelle Obama school of going high when they go low, especially with other women. But enforcing a boundary and refusing bad treatment did feel deeply good in the moment.Now I’m a fiction writer and before that I was a producer in news and current affairs. In both these occupations, it is the skills I acquired in waitressing that have served me the most. I learned to de-centre my own story, so that someone else’s can be told. It’s why, while working as a news producer, I could manage the agitation of a very well-known musician (sorry, can’t name names), or the hot-temper of a fiery athlete (still can’t name names).And yes, waitressing taught me when you can no longer serve someone. How to judge that your ability to handle their needs has come to an end.If you wait tables long enough, you will encounter every kind of person. And how you deal with those people will show you every part of yourself.

Food assistant: Alice Hughes.The sweet spotBakingBenjamina Ebuehi’s recipe for raspberry and pistachio hand piesA raspberry slice with irresistible pistachio frangipaneBenjamina EbuehiFri 26 May 2023 15.00 BSTIf you’re someone who prefers a high pastry-to-fruit ratio in your pies, then these are for you. I’ve made them with numerous variations of fruit and frangipane, but this combination of pistachio and raspberry might just be my favourite. The pistachio paste is great for ramping up the pistachio flavour, but don’t worry if you can’t get hold of any – these pies are still great without. Eat them while they’re still a bit warm, with a splash of cold cream for a fancy afternoon snack.Raspberry and pistachio hand piesPrep 10 minChill 2-3 hrCook 1 hr 20 minMakes 6For the pastry325g plain flour, plus extra for dusting2 tbsp sugar½ tsp salt250g unsalted butter, dicedFor the frangipane100g pistachio kernels90g unsalted butter, softened90g golden caster sugarZest of 1 lemon½ tbsp pistachio paste (optional)1 egg, plus extra for the egg wash½ tbsp plain flourA pinch of salt150g raspberries, tossed in 1 tsp sugarDemerara sugar, to finishTo make the pastry, put the flour, sugar and salt in a bowl, then rub in the diced butter until the mixture turns chunky (it’s fine if there are some larger bits of butter in there).Make a well in the middle, add 60ml cold water and stir with a table knife until it starts to come together into a dough. Continue adding water a tablespoon at a time until there are no dry patches of flour (you’ll probably need 100-120ml cold water in total). Turn out the dough on to a lightly floured surface and bring it together with your hands. Roll out into a rough rectangle, fold the top third down to the middle, then fold the bottom third up on top of that (a bit like a letter). Wrap in clingfilm and chill for two to three hours, or until firm.Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6 and line two oven trays with baking paper.To make the filling, finely grind the pistachios in a food processor. Beat the butter, sugar and lemon zest until smooth, then mix in the pistachio paste, if using. Beat in the egg, then stir in the ground pistachios, flour and salt. Spoon into a piping bag and chill until needed.On a lightly floured surface, roll out the pastry to a large, 3-4mm-thick rectangle. Cut it into 12 even rectangles, then pipe some filling on to six pieces, leaving a ½cm border around the edge. Arrange the raspberries on top and brush the edges with egg wash. Lay one of the remaining pastry strips on top of each raspberry-topped rectangle, and press together at the edges to seal. Crimp the edges with a fork, then brush the tops with egg wash.Sprinkle generously with demerara sugar, then cut a couple of slits in the top of each pie, so the steam can escape. Bake for 25-30 minutes, until golden, then transfer to a rack and leave to cool for 10 minutes before serving warm.TopicsBakingThe sweet spotPieFoodCakeDessertFruitPastryrecipesReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedFashionFoodRecipesLove & sexHealth & fitnessHome & gardenWomenMenFamilyTravelMoneyNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

I am in my 50s now and my poor fingers look dreadful after years of chewing. I understand this to be a form of self-harm but it is such ingrained behaviour I seem unable to stop. I feel embarrassed by the state of my hands and find myself often tucking my fingers under so people can’t see them.I have had extensive therapy and understand why this behaviour may have started. I suffered severe anxiety as a child and my mental health was poor throughout the first half of my adult life. But I am much better now, so why does it continue?I stop finger chewing for a couple of months but always start it againI’ve tried hypnotism, which works for a while. Interestingly I obsessively press the ends of my fingers for weeks after I have been hypnotised – almost like I need to feel them. I stop finger chewing for a couple of months but I always start it again.Do you have any suggestions that might help me?I’m sorry to hear you are struggling with this. I used to do a similar thing: as a child and young adult I used to rip the skin from around my fingers and my feet – the latter sometimes so badly it hurt to walk. I still pick the skin around my fingers, but to a much more manageable degree.I went to BACP-registered psychotherapist Emma Cullinan, who specialises on the impact of childhood events on current, at times compulsive, behaviours.“Children are at the mercy of the behaviour of people around them,” she explained. “Unable to fight or flight, they work out coping strategies. When we are distressed, we often resort to self-destructive behaviours or try to soothe ourselves. These coping strategies are actually designed to help a child deal with difficult emotions, but as you have found, while there is short-term gain, it is followed by guilt, and in your case embarrassment.”I wonder if you can remember what happened to trigger this. Because while coping mechanisms seem like they help, giving them up can be hard if the underlying problem is not dealt with. Otherwise what happens is a cycle of try/fail/shame/anxiety/go back to the original coping mechanism.I note you have had extensive therapy but I wonder what sort, and when. Experience has taught me that sometimes we are only really ready to process things that happened in childhood when we are much older. I wonder if you might consider finding someone else who could help you specifically with this – maybe do some behavioural therapy alongside a talking one.Having nail clippers handy to clip off any protruding ‘pickable’ bits works for me“In trying to stop using a coping mechanism,” says Cullinan, “we must face some difficult emotions and memories that have been somewhat numbed by the coping strategy. Even if you know, rationally, that you are better now and don’t need this coping mechanism any more, subconsciously you will feel that it has got you this far in life, making it difficult to let go.”Some practical things which help me (but I have had therapy, including CBT, at varying stages throughout my life and continue to have it) are: knitting, baking, playing the piano and being on my phone. If I just sit and talk to people, I pick, even if I’m not anxious. I have found having nail clippers handy to clip off any protruding “pickable” bits works for me, but it might not for you if they are used to inflict more damage. I also rub a really lovely balm into my fingers and cuticles to keep them smooth, again so there are no bits to grab hold of. A worry ring/worry beads might also help you.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Inside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Were there unkind thoughts towards yourself? If you can consciously name the feeling it may help you understand what leads to this behaviour.“It sounds as if you experienced difficult emotions at a young age which were not picked up at the time. I imagine you were not comforted so you had to deal with these overwhelming emotions on your own.”Cullinan and I both agree that you really need to be compassionate towards yourself.

Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty ImagesUS immigration‘I feel safe here’: the people leaving everything behind to seek refuge in USPolitical dysfunction and economic calamity are pushing people from many nations in the western hemisphere in what Biden has called the ‘largest migration in human history’Lorena Figueroa in El Paso, TexasFri 26 May 2023 11.00 BSTLast modified on Fri 26 May 2023 16.59 BSTThe US homeland security secretary, Alejandro Mayorkas, has a message for migrants that he has been repeating loudly and frequently: “Our border is not open … don’t risk your life and your life savings” to come to the US seeking refuge without invitation.But for millions, hunger, violence and fear ring out louder. Political dysfunction and economic calamity are pushing people from many nations in the western hemisphere in what Joe Biden has called the “largest migration in human history”, exacerbated in Latin America and beyond by the coronavirus pandemic.People with tenacity but few means make a hopeful journey mostly across land towards the US-Mexico border. If they beat the odds to reach American soil they may find harbor – or more heartbreak.Yesi Ortega choked up when talking to the Guardian at a shelter in El Paso, west Texas, earlier this month, as she recounted the odyssey she, her husband Raphael López and their five-year-old son, Matías, had spent six months making.The family had reached a tipping point in their native Venezuela and followed more than 7 million other citizens who have fled the country’s economic collapse and pervasive hunger when their choice came down to food or clothing, Ortega, 24, said.“We had no option. We needed to take the risk,” she said. Like almost a third of this exodus, they first tried nextdoor Colombia, itself unstable and contributing amid the post-pandemic hardship to the latest rise in migration towards the US.Yesi Ortega, 24, with her husband, Raphael López, and their five-year-old son, Matías. They fled Venezuela during the county’s economic collapse and pervasive hunger. Photograph: Lorena Figueroa/The GuardianOrtega found work in a restaurant kitchen and López labored in a plastics factory in Medellín. But they were paid less, as migrants, the equivalent of $35 a week between them, when a staple such as milk was $3 a liter and the rent was crippling, she said.When they failed to get legal status and couldn’t access the healthcare system or school for Matías, like many others they left Colombia for the US.They survived the slog and danger of walking through the hellish Darién Gap jungle into Panama and trudged through Central America and Mexico, fraught with risk, especially for foreigners migrating on a shoestring.The family didn’t use human smugglers, Ortega said. She recounted how, along the way, they were mugged twice at gunpoint, slept under torrential rains and endured cold nights, leapt on to freight trains when they could, worked temporary jobs and begged for money to buy food, water and bus tickets to relieve the trek whenever possible.Eventually, they reached Ciudad Juárez, across the Mexican border from El Paso. After all that, Matías then broke his right arm while playing. But the family pressed on and went to Door 40 in the towering border barrier to turn themselves in to federal border patrol agents.Scenes from the US-Mexico border as Title 42 ends: in pictures Read moreAt first they were separated. Ortega and Matías were taken and held in New Mexico while López, 27, was sent to a detention center 85 miles away in Tornillo, which became known in the Trump administration for holding unaccompanied migrant children in detention camps.They were released after about a week of what they described as cold, uncomfortable conditions and managed to reunite and find a shelter in El Paso. Last week the three traveled to Chicago, where they had a contact address, to await their interview with the immigration authorities in June to find out if they will be allowed to go through the full asylum system in the US – or be deported.The family entered the US before the Title 42 pandemic-related rule was lifted on 11 May, which had blocked many from requesting asylum while allowing some families with young children to do so. After that block ended, the Biden administration nevertheless brought in a “presumption of ineligibility” for asylum for people who simply turn themselves in at the border. This has enraged immigration advocates, who call the new restriction an asylum ban. No matter what, the dice are loaded against Ortega and her family if the authorities conclude they are economic migrants.Around the corner from the shelter, fellow Venezuelan José Ocando, 28, was sleeping on the ground in an alley on a thin mat with some blankets.He had also been living in Colombia, with his wife, but was tracked down by members of a gang who told him his impoverished mother back in Venezuela had a debt outstanding and said they would kill them both if they didn’t pay up.“We left everything from one day to another. There was no time to figure out why these people wanted me to pay a debt I didn’t even know about,” he told the Guardian.They fled and took buses to Monterrey in northern Mexico. There they were within geofencing range to access the US government’s app, CBP One on a smartphone, to request a US asylum appointment.They tried every day for a month but couldn’t get an appointment, Ocando said. So they went to Matamoros, where the Rio Grande infamously claims lives and on 11 May produced scenes of frightened young children, some roped together and with little inflatable rings to stop them from drowning, clinging to their parents on the muddy riverbank as others waited up to their necks in the river, all on the wrong side of razor wire with gun-toting US troops beyond.Ocando and his wife made it across safely, although he was detained and expelled back to Mexico, while his wife was allowed in. She traveled to Utah to join an uncle – as those claiming asylum must give an address to the authorities – and after Ocando traveled the length of the Texas-Mexico border, he was allowed into El Paso.Now he’s found a part-time job carrying blocks on a construction site and is saving for a bus ticket to join his wife as they also await an asylum interview.“It’s been difficult, but I feel safe here,” he told the Guardian.Meanwhile, Fabiola Cometán, 45, also felt protected on US soil after decades of physical abuse by her two former partners, she said.Fabiola Cometán who fled Peru with her six-year-old son, Luis, feels protected on US soil after decades of physical abuse by her two former partners, she said. Photograph: Lorena Figueroa/The GuardianThe last straw was receiving a death threat from one of her sisters in their native Peru recently over a debt, going to police and being ignored and then threatened by three men who came to her door demanding the money be paid, she said.Before leaving Lima to join a small group of mostly Venezuelan migrants traveling together for safety overland to the US, she had to decide which of her children to take with her.She thought of the hazards of the Darién and the danger of extortion and sexual assault in Mexico, she said.She sobbed as she said she took her six-year-old son and left her nine-year-old daughter behind with another sister, to protect her from the greater risk of being raped or kidnapped.“My heart broke into pieces, but I had to leave her to come here and find a better opportunity for all of us,” she said.She plans to make her way to New York and go through the asylum process there. Her son, Luis, talked excitedly of going to school and one day seeing snow.

He was known as No 28 there.Campbell says he was also emotionally, physically and sexually abused at the home. “We call it the gates from hell,” he says.“We were used as slave labour and sexual toys. If kids done anything wrong we would get locked up and chained to this big tree.”A powerful exhibition of 20 black and white portraits of survivors taken between 2002 and 2014 by the photographer Sarah Barker is now being displayed for the first time at Redfern’s National Centre of Indigenous Excellence.Jarrett says it’s an opportunity to remember the lives of the home’s 600 child inmates. “There’s only about 57 of us left now, it’s so important that people hear about it, learn about it, and know about it,” he says.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Guardian Australia's Afternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update email breaks down the key national and international stories of the day and why they matterPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Photograph: Steven Senne/APLos Angeles‘Those who hate AI are insecure’: inside Hollywood’s battle over artificial intelligence‘We are at a cocktail party pretending we know what we’re talking about,’ an editor said. But it’s clear the role of AI in cinema is dividing the industryLois Beckett@loisbeckettFri 26 May 2023 11.00 BSTLast modified on Fri 26 May 2023 16.38 BSTOn the picket lines outside Los Angeles film studios, artificial intelligence has become a central antagonist of the Hollywood writers’ strike, with signs warning studio executives that writers will not let themselves be replaced by ChatGPTThat hasn’t stopped tech industry players from selling the promise of a future in which AI is an essential tool for every part of Hollywood production, from budgeting and concept art, to script development, to producing a first cut of a feature film with a single press of a button.‘Pens down!’: Hollywood writers strike as late-night comedy shows go darkRead moreThe writer’s strike has put the spotlight on escalating tensions over whether an AI-powered production process will be a dream or a nightmare for most Hollywood workers and for their audiences.Los Angeles’s AI boosters tout the latest disruptive technology as a democratising force in film, one that will liberate creators by taking over dull and painstaking tasks like motion capture, allowing them to turn their ideas into finished works of art without a budget of millions or tens of millions of dollars. They envision a world in which every artist has a “holographic vision board”, which will enable them to instantly see any possible idea in action.Critics say that studio executives simply want to replace unionized artists with compliant robots, a process that can only lead to increasingly mediocre, or even inhuman, art.All these tensions were on display last week when tech companies that specialise in AI, including Dell, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise and Nvidia, were among the sponsors of an “AI on the Lot” conference in Hollywood, which attracted an estimated 400 people to overflowing sessions about how artificial intelligence was disrupting every facet of film production. One tech investor described the mood as both high energy and high anxiety.The people who hate it or are fearful of it are insecure about their own talentRobert LegatoThe day before the AI conference, a crowdfunded plane had flown over multiple studios with a banner message: “Pay the writers, you AI-holes.” But several speakers at the AI LA conference argued that fear of artificial intelligence is for the weak.“The people who hate it or are fearful of it are insecure about their own talent,” said Robert Legato, an Academy Award-winning visual effects expert who has worked on films like Titanic, the Jungle Book and the Lion King.“It’s like a feeling amplifier,” said Pinar Seyhan Demirdag, an artist turned AI entrepreneur. “If you feel confident, you will excel. If you feel inferior –,” she paused. The tech crowd laughed.‘No more Godfather, no more Wizard of Oz’It’s hard to know how exactly the battles over AI in Hollywood will play out, given the heavy haze of marketing bombast, fearmongering and simple confusion about the technology that’s currently hovering over the industry.“A lot of us are at a cocktail party pretending we know what we’re talking about,” Cynthia Littleton, the co-editor-in-chief of Variety magazine, told the Hollywood AI conference.But it’s clear that some of the emerging conflicts will focus on job losses from automation, copyright and intellectual property disputes and deeper questions about how much a profit-driven studio system actually cares about human creativity.Getty Images recently sued Stability AI, the maker of a prominent text-to-image generator, accusing it of improperly training its algorithms on 12m Getty photographs, while officially working with another AI company, Nvidia, to develop licensed photo and video AI products that will provide royalties to content creatorsFor the first time in 15 years, writers walked picket lines at Paramount Pictures for better pay. Photograph: Jim Ruymen/UPI/ShutterstockBecause AI video technology is still lagging behind audio or image generation, the music industry is currently “the tip of the spear” for AI battles, said Littleton, pointing to the controversy over recent AI simulations of songs by Drake and The Weeknd. But Hollywood is gearing up for the era of AI-generated actors: Metaphysic, an AI company that specializes in “deep fakes”, announced a partnership that would work to develop new tools for the clients of Creative Artists Agency CAA’s, a major entertainment and sports talent agency.Joanna Popper, the talent agency’s new “chief metaverse officer”, told Deadline in January that the new technology will offer flexibility to actors and other entertainers, who will still retain the rights to their image and likeness. “Some actors have done commercials where essentially their synthetic media double did the commercial rather than the actor traveling around the world,” she said.“If the actor isn’t available for the reshoots a director needs, you can have a stand-in for the actor and then use this technology for face replacement and still get the job done in the needed timeline,” Popper offered. “If you wanted the actor to speak in a different language, you could use AI to create an international dub that sounds like the actor’s voice speaking various other languages.”Some Hollywood writers and actors have begun to denounce these developments, arguing that the coming age of AI is a threat to workers across the industry. “AI has to be addressed now or never,” Justine Bateman, a writer and director who was a television actor in the 90s, argued in a viral Twitter thread, calling on the Screen Actors Guild to follow the writers’ guild in making AI regulations a central part of their coming contract negotiations. “If we don’t make strong rules now, they simply won’t notice if we strike in three years, because at that point they won’t need us.”The more than 160,000 members of Sag-Aftra, which includes screen actors, broadcast journalists and a wide range of other performers and media professionals, are currently voting on whether to authorize their own strike.We’re going to get the stories of people who have been disempowered told through the voice of the algorithm rather than people who have experienced itDiandra Pendleton-ThompsonMany Hollywood critics argue that too much reliance on AI in film-making is a threat to the very humanity of art itself. Speaking at Cannes, actor Sean Penn expressed support for writers, calling the use of AI in writing scripts a “human obscenity”. “ChatGPT doesn’t have childhood trauma,” one viral writers strike sign quipped.If studios pivot to producing AI-generated stories to save money, they may end up alienating audiences and bankrupting themselves, leaving TikTok and YouTube as the only surviving entertainment giants, the Hunger Games screenwriter Billy Ray warned on a recent podcast.“No more Godfather, no more Wizard of Oz, it’ll just be 15-second clips of human folly,” he said.Black film and TV writers in particular have been speaking out about the ways AI could be used by studios to generate “diverse” content without actually having to work with a diversity of artists.“We’re going to get the stories of people who have been disempowered told through the voice of the algorithm rather than people who have experienced it,” the Star Trek writer Diandra Pendleton-Thompson warned on the first day of the writers strike.‘AI lacks courage to write something truly human’Some recent entrants to the AI industry say that the current technology is being overhyped, and its likely impact, particularly on writers, has been exaggerated.“When people tell me the studios are going to replace writers with AI, to me, that person has never tried to do anything really difficult with large language models,” said Mike Gioia, one of the executives of Pickaxe, a new Chat GPT-based platform for writers with a few hundred paying customers.He called the idea that AI could produce full scripts “science fiction”.Writer Ilana Pena holds a sign on the picket line on the fourth day of the strike on 5 May 2023. Photograph: Frederic J Brown/AFP/Getty Images“The worst-case scenario for writers is that the size of writers rooms is reduced,” he said.Many early Pickaxe customers, Gioia said, are using it to automate mundane tasks, like filing internal reports or making interactive FAQs for e-commerce sites. While the technology can generate a rough draft of a formulaic TV script for a writer to tinker with, Gioia said, he believed it would be “a fool’s errand” to try to get it to produce good dialogue. While AI is good at understanding the “meta structure” of a piece of text, Gioia said, “It lacks the courage to try to write something truly human.”AI writing tools could have big effects in less glamorous segments of the film industry. Pickaxe is currently exploring whether it can use the AI tools to help automate the budgeting process of reading a script, breaking down the different visual effects needed to produce each shot and then estimating the cost of those effects, Ian Eck, another Pickaxe executive, said.Writers have made AI central to their strike in part because “it’s a good story”, Gioia argued and partly because they are much less accustomed to being disrupted by technology than other industry workers.“A lot of people in post-production have lived through multiple technological revolutions in their fields, but writers haven’t lived through a single one,” he said.James Blevins, whose decade-long career in special effects and post production has taken him from 1996’s Space Jam to The Mandalorian, told attendees of the AI conference in LA that the anxiety around AI reminded him of the anxiety around the digitization of film in the late 1990s and early 2000s.“I’ve always done the job that will be replaced. I’ve always been automated out of my job. It’s just the way it is,” he said.When people tell me the studios are going to replace writers with AI, to me, that person has never tried to do anything really difficult with large language modelsMike GioiaHe cautioned that there was no way to escape the changes that AI would bring to the industry.“It’s so disruptive, it’s kind of like being afraid of the automobile, or, ‘Oh my God, we shouldn’t go to the moon,’” he said.What went unanswered in the panel discussion was how many of Hollywood’s technical workers, from set designers to hairstylists, would be able to translate their skills into a more virtual film world – and how many might simply be laid off.IATSCE, the union representing 168,000 entertainment industry technicians, artisans and craftspeople, announced in early May that it would be forming its own commission on artificial intelligence to investigate the impact of the technology on workers. The union is also interested in helping to unionizing new segments of workers that may emerge in the wake of AI disruptions – including the new category of AI wranglers that the tech boosters are currently calling “prompt engineers”, said Justin Loeb, IATSCE’s director of communications.But in a tech industry driven by hype, it’s still not clear how much change is really coming, or how fast.“VR was going to be huge in the 90s, and well, that didn’t really happen and then it was going to be huge about five years ago and that hasn’t happened,” Gregory Shiff, who works on media and entertainment issues for Dell, said on the panel briefly moderated by an avatar of Vermeer’s Girl with a Pearl Earring. “Is AI going to be the same? I don’t think so, but I don’t know.”TopicsLos AngelesFilm industryCaliforniaArtificial intelligence (AI)DellHewlett-PackardfeaturesReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

In fact, the entrance this week of Florida’s Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, into the race for his party’s presidential nomination only adds gasoline to his raging feud with the theme park giant over diversity and transgender rights.Florida restaurant sues Ron DeSantis over law banning drag performancesRead moreIt’s a battle that is, conversely, both an essential ingredient to the culture war agenda DeSantis believes will win him the White House in 2024; and a headache he could well do without as he attempts to prove his credentials as a fiscally responsible conservative.From the moment Disney’s bosses dared to speak out in March 2022 against DeSantis’s notorious parental rights in education bill, the so-called “don’t say gay” law that outlaws discussion in Florida’s classrooms of sexual orientation and gender identity, the governor climbed aboard a rollercoaster he doesn’t seem to want to get off.“DeSantis is running for president and looking for issues that will appeal to potential Republican primary voters all across the country,” said Aubrey Jewett, professor of political science at the University of Central Florida, and a longtime Disney observer.“Certainly the main reason for attacking Disney is he believes it will increase his name recognition and visibility in a positive way, but it doesn’t make a lot of sense.Ron DeSantis announced he will be running for his party’s presidential nomination for 2024. Photograph: Cheney Orr/AFP/Getty Images“The rational response would have been to say we disagree with Disney on the issue, they have a right to speak out, but we passed the bill and it’s time to move on and work with Disney on other issues. That would have been sort of normal, but instead you just have him coming in and doubling down time and time again.”By way of retaliation for Disney’s criticism, the notoriously thin-skinned governor has stripped the company of its right to self-govern by installing a hand-picked oversight board stocked with political allies; his cronies filed a lawsuit against Disney seeking to void protections the company awarded itself before the DeSantis takeover; and in an egregious move he threatened to build a new state prison adjacent to its central Florida theme parks.Touting Florida as the state where “woke comes to die”, DeSantis has attempted to paint Disney as a woke, leftist corporation, with privileges including the right to raise tax revenue and control development on its land that no other business enjoys.“There’s a new sheriff in town, and accountability will be the order of the day,” DeSantis boasted in February as he announced Disney was to lose some of its decades-old autonomy.NAACP says Florida travel warning is just the start of organizing effortRead moreHis supporters, meanwhile, continue to attack the content of Disney’s attractions and movies for “indoctrinating” children, and accuse the company of leaning too far into perceived “woke” issues by addressing misogyny and racism.Disney, Florida’s largest private employer with an estimated 75,000 cast members, has also not been idle in the face of the attacks.As well as outsmarting DeSantis by moving to strip the new board of many of its responsibilities before its first meeting, Disney has filed a lawsuit of its own, accusing DeSantis of “a targeted campaign of government retaliation”.It’s an argument gaining traction even among DeSantis’s Republican colleagues, several of whom have questioned his motives for attacking a private company that attracts tens of millions of visitors to Florida and generates more than $75bn in tourism revenue each year.“I don’t think Ron DeSantis is a conservative, based on his actions towards Disney,” said Chris Christie, the former New Jersey governor, last month.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First ThingFree daily newsletterStart the day with the top stories from the US, plus the day’s must-reads from across the GuardianPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That’s what I always thought liberals did. And now all of a sudden here we are participating in this with a Republican governor.”As if to prove Christie’s point, Disney this week cancelled plans for a $1bn campus in Florida that would have created 2,000 jobs, citing, in part, “changing business conditions” for its decision.Jewett, and other analysts, believe the dispute will ultimately be settled in a courtroom, but not before DeSantis milks the controversy on the campaign trail and corporate behemoth Disney enjoys a spell as a somewhat unlikely banner carrier for LGBTQ+ rights.“It’s funny in some ways. They are progressive, they certainly have more diverse casting and more diverse storylines in their movies and many of their streaming shows,” Jewett said.DeSantis is running for president and looking for issues that will appeal to potential Republican primary voters all across the countryAubrey Jewett“But you’ve often had Democrats and progressives attacking Disney for not being progressive enough as an employer, not treating their workers well, or at least as well as they should and not doing enough. And they also criticize Disney for having its own government, they see it as another example of corporate power.“We’re also beginning to see some Republican pushback on DeSantis. If it gets to the general election, across many states and looking at the average voter, I think many won’t agree with what DeSantis has done. He could be in for a rude awakening.”Joe Saunders, political director of the advocacy group Equality Florida, was also cautious of recognising Disney as “woke warriors”.“I don’t know I’d give much weight to Disney being the frontline in the progressive battle against conservative policy. I think it’s more about setting the framework for what norms should be in the US,” he said.“What does it mean if every time an individual or corporation asserts its belief on public policy that should invite such specific targeted retribution from a political leader with serious and significant executive power? That’s a real important question.”TopicsFloridaRon DeSantisWalt Disney CompanyRepublicansUS elections 2024analysisReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

However, they have routinely been broken by both sides. More than 330 deaths and 2,300 injuries were recorded by Sapa on days that were at least partially covered by ceasefires.Circle timeline showing the number of civilian casualties per day in SudanHere, relatives and friends of three of Sudan’s civilian victims recall their final hours.Mohammed SalahSalah, a medical student at the Sudan University of Science and Technology, died in Khartoum on 15 April, the first day of hostilities, after being hit three times by sniper fire.The 21-year-old’s day had started with the short drive from his home to Khartoum international airport, where the mother of one of his classmate’s had become stranded. On arrival, a second person – a man whom Salah did not know – asked for a lift, so Salah picked him up too.Mohammed Salah (left) and his brother Mustafa Salah.He drove his passengers, both of whom lived in neighbouring Omdurman, back to his house, where they ate the Ramadan fast-breaking iftar meal.The woman was happy to stay at Salah’s house for the night, but the man said he wanted to go home, so Salah set out again in his car.On every approach he made to the various bridges over the White Nile that link Khartoum to its twin city of Omdurman he encountered intense fighting between the army and the RSF.Eventually he gave up and headed home, only to find himself caught in a battle between army soldiers on the ground and RSF snipers positioned on the top of buildings around the main campus of his university, which lies at the confluence of the White Nile and the Blue Nile.Within the space of a few minutes Salah and both his passengers had been killed. An army soldier told Salah’s father he had been shot once in the head and twice in the chest. Raging fighting meant it took 15 hours for the family to retrieve his body.“It’s very hard to talk about it but I will try,” his older brother Mustafa said.“Mohamed loved doing good things,” Mustafa said, explaining why his brother had agreed to undertake the dangerous, night-time drive. “He was the most helpful and generous one among us.”Suhair Abdallah el-BasherBasher, a lawyer, was killed along with two of her relatives on 25 April after a shell exploded as she left her family house in Khartoum to get in a car that was due to take her to a safer neighbourhood.The 67-year-old had been stranded in the house near the presidential palace with her two brothers-in-law and her eldest child for 10 days. They had no electricity and food and water were starting to run out.Suhair Abdallah el-BasherOn 25 April, it appeared that one of the many ceasefires agreed by Sudan’s warring parties was finally holding. The street outside the house was calm and empty of fighters for the first time since the conflict began.Another of Basher’s daughters arrived to pick up relatives and drive them to a safer neighbourhood.The eldest child – Hiba el-Rayeh – made it into her sister’s car, but as the older relatives walked the couple of yards between the front door and car door a shell exploded.Rayeh said she lost consciousness during the explosion and when she came to she saw her mother and uncles lying on the road, badly injured but still alive. “Then I started screaming, ‘We are civilians, we are civilians, please don’t hit us’,” she said.RSF fighters put Rayeh’s mother and uncles into the back of a pick-up truck. Rayeh and her sister followed the truck for two hours as it drove around the city trying to find a hospital that was open. By the time they found one, all three had died.Zakria AbdallahAbdallah died last week in Geneina, a city in west Darfur, during an attack on his neighbourhood by RSF fighters.Jalal, a friend of the 41-year-old who did not want to give his full name, said Abdallah and five other men were killed as they tried to flee from the RSF.“My friend’s body remained under a tree in front of my house for a day and a half,” said Jalal by phone from Chad, to where he has fled. “We could not recover him because of the intense fighting on the streets, we could not bury him in a cemetery.”The 33-year-old, who used to work with an NGO, said he witnessed appalling scenes before managing to escape across the border. “I saw the worst of the worst,” he said. “The streets were filled with bodies.”TopicsSudanAfricaMiddle East and north AfricafeaturesReuse this contentMore on this storyMore on this storyBritish man, 85, ‘shot and wife starved to death’ after being left in Sudan6h agoSudan: US-Saudi brokered ceasefire begins with reports of continued fighting4d agoSudan’s warring factions sign agreement for seven-day ceasefire6d agoAirstrikes hit Khartoum as fighting between Sudanese factions intensifies16 May 2023Communal violence and civilian deaths in Sudan fuel fears of widening conflict 12 May 2023Why is the Darfur region so central to fighting in Sudan?12 May 2023Sudan medical volunteers detained after being seized from ambulance8 May 2023Lone child refugees stranded in Sudan may ‘risk travelling to UK on small boats’8 May 2023Most viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The sprawling tent encampments that once lined the sidewalks of Portland’s Old Town were mostly gone.“This is what should be normal,” said Burke, who bought and renovated the 132-year-old Mariners Building in 2013 and transformed it into the chic hotel on 3rd Avenue.Living in the Alaska rainforest with 1,000 bears: ‘Not the easiest place to be homeless’Read moreBurke owes this to a palpable and controversial shift in liberal Portland, a city that had long opted for a mostly hands-off policy to the camps that had come to dominate the hotel’s surrounding blocks. Now, at the urging of residents like Burke, the city is clearing camps, sometimes daily, and planning to encourage unhoused people to relocate to centralized communities.“The only policies I’ve seen are compassion on top of compassion,” Burke said. “Anyone who works with these populations knows there are people who respond to carrots and people who respond to sticks. Everyone who responds to carrots, good work; you got them. Most of the people that are left respond to enforcement.”Advocates for unhoused people say they strongly disagree. This new “normal” in Old Town represents a distinct turning point in one of the country’s most progressive cities.Unhoused Portlanders are feeling the increased pressure. Aistheta Gleason built themself a home of pallets when they first arrived in Portland from Colorado last summer. “I had a living room, a bedroom. It was all planned out,” they said. “I had a queen-sized bed and a water filter.”A record 193 homeless people died in Oregon’s Multnomah county, where Portland is located, in 2021. Photograph: Craig Mitchelldyer/APLast fall the cops showed up, and Gleason says they were arrested for trespassing and resisting arrest, after a confrontation during which they initially refused to drop a walking stick. In the patrol car, they watched city workers dismantle the camp.Now, they push their belongings, including at least two dozen books, around Old Town, where social services are close. Gleason doesn’t bother setting up a tent, knowing they’ll have to move it daily. Instead, they sleep with their dog in a different spot every night, wrapping up in a sleeping bag and a tarp.The shift in city tactics is a product of changing political winds. Last fall, the Portland city commissioner Jo Ann Hardesty – who had for some residents come to represent a misguided and overly permissive approach to a homelessness epidemic – failed in her re-election attempt. Hardesty oversaw the Portland bureau of transportation, which is tasked with enforcing sidewalk ordinances that might prevent people from camping wherever they want. Hardesty ardently opposed enforcing those ordinances, as her constituency of unhoused people gained political power and legal clout.The US city where ‘desert palaces’ are sprouting as affordable homes dwindleRead moreHardesty’s loss came at the hands of a more “law-and-order” Democrat in Rene Gonzalez. His central argument, according to his campaign website: “Taking a hands-off approach to homelessness is not compassionate or progressive; it’s dangerous and inhumane.”Gonzalez promised not only to work for increased shelter capacity and access to mental health and addiction services, but also to relocate illegally parked RVs and “clean up” parks and neighborhoods.One of the commissioner’s first high-profile moves was to direct Portland fire and rescue, an agency he oversees, to stop handing out tents in the city. That move took effect just as a historic winter storm and a foot of snow walloped the region, and just after a new report that 2021 was the deadliest year of the last decade for homeless Portlanders, with 193 who died on the streets, of more than 5,200 known unhoused people.Gonzalez’s election also came as the embattled mayor, Ted Wheeler, and other officials were hard at work on a new approach: both enforcing the ordinances that prevent people from “sleeping on sidewalks” and enabling the construction of a half-dozen “Safe Rest Villages” with space for up to 150 residents apiece.The twin initiatives – a ban on tent camping on city streets and the village-building – are wildly unpopular among homeless advocates and the unhoused themselves, who insist that the sweeps do nothing but criminalize homelessness, traumatizing an already traumatized population. (A spokeperson for the mayor’s office did not respond to a request for comment.)Other critics say the villages are a waste of resources better directed at the many underlying causes of the crisis, including the opioid crisis and housing shortages. Portland led the country in rent increases – prices rose by 39% – in 2021, according to Redfin.Only about 10% of Portlanders swept from encampments and offered shelter between April 2022 and February 2023 remain in temporary shelter. Photograph: Craig Mitchelldyer/AP“I appreciate the fact that we have to allow unfettered access to our sidewalks, certainly for people who are disabled,” said Scott Kerman, director of the homelessness non-profit Blanchet House, referencing a September lawsuit filed under the Americans with Disabilities Act, introduced by 10 Portlanders claiming the city is illegally allowing campers to block sidewalks. “But sweeps are at best a Band-Aid, and they often make things worse.”In Portland, the sweeps haven’t been particularly effective at relocating people to safe, permanent homes. Only about 10% of Portlanders swept from encampments and offered shelter between April 2022 and February 2023 remain in temporary shelter. And fewer than 1% found permanent housing, according to data on 1,700 unhoused people released in February for Multnomah county, where Portland is located. The rest, presumably, remain outside.“Sweeps just shuffle people from one place to the next,” said Monta Knudsen, executive director of the social services agency Bridges to Change. “A camping ban is just one more tool in the toolbox to make people uncomfortable. We’re just making homelessness more invisible again.”‘It’s hell’: life under the American mobile home king who calls himself a ‘grave dancer’Read moreThe harsher policies being enacted now represent a turning point, welcome to some and alarming to others who say that it’s not necessary to pit houseless people against housed ones.Angela Martin, executive director of the Portland non-profit HereTogether, said: “That the solution to homelessness is binary, a competition between two approaches, that’s what’s dooming our efforts.”Andre Rochelle has been homeless for seven months, since his marriage deteriorated last year. After an overdose on some powder laced with fentanyl, Rochelle set up a “cozy, comfortable” tent beneath the Burnside Bridge. But he has to pack it up and move daily.“Homelessness is illegal, period,” said Rochelle, 56. “They have the power to do it, so be it.”

Convict Navalny, you have been issued a book, so sit down and read it. You’ll find out what you’re being accused of at your sentencing.

Photograph: AFP/Getty ImagesSudanBritish man, 85, ‘shot and wife starved to death’ after being left in SudanFamily say couple were not offered support to evacuate despite living near British embassy in KhartoumTobi Thomas@tobithomas_Fri 26 May 2023 13.48 BSTFirst published on Fri 26 May 2023 10.23 BSTAn 85-year-old British citizen was shot by snipers and his wife died of starvation after they were left behind in Sudan, their family has said.Abdalla Sholgami, who owns a hotel in London, lived with his 80-year-old wife, Alaweya Rishwan, who is disabled, close to the UK’s diplomatic base in Khartoum, the BBC said.According to the report, Sholgami was not offered support to leave Sudan and was instead told to go to an airfield 25 miles (40km) outside Khartoum, crossing a war zone, to board an evacuation flight.Faced with starvation and with no water, Sholgami was forced to leave his wife to find help. While he was away he was shot three times – in his hand, chest and lower back – by snipers. He survived after being taken to a family member in another part of Khartoum.The family said Sholgami’s wife was left to fend for herself and it was impossible for them to reach her in an area surrounded by snipers. As a result she died of starvation.Sholgami’s granddaughter Azhaar, who grew up in Khartoum, said the embassy was a “maximum four steps away” from her grandparents’ home.She said: “What happened to my grandparents was a crime against humanity, not only by the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), not only by the [Sudanese army], but by the British embassy, because they were the only ones that could have prevented this from happening to my grandparents.”Sholgami managed to escape to Egypt, where he is receiving medical treatment after he was operated on without anaesthetic in Khartoum by his son, who is a doctor.03:43Why violence has broken out in Sudan – video explainerThe fighting started on 15 April after months of escalating tensions between the military, led by Gen Abdel-Fattah al-Burhan, and the Rapid Support Forces commanded by Gen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo.‘It’s very hard to talk about’: the civilian toll of fighting in Sudan Read moreA Foreign Office spokesperson said: “The final UK evacuation flight departed on 3 May, concluding the longest and largest evacuation of any western nation. The successful operation has evacuated more than 2,450 people on 30 flights, the vast majority of them being British nationals and their dependents.“The Sholgamis’ case is extremely sad. The ongoing military conflict means Sudan remains dangerous. Our ability to provide consular assistance is severely limited and we cannot provide in-person support within Sudan.“The UK is taking a leading role in the diplomatic efforts to secure peace in Sudan. We have coordinated with key international partners on the global response to the crisis, including pressing for access for humanitarian agencies to ensure communities can reach the essential services they need.”TopicsSudanMiddle East and north AfricaForeign policyLondonAfricanewsReuse this contentMore on this storyMore on this story‘It’s very hard to talk about’: the civilian toll of fighting in Sudan 10h agoSudan: US-Saudi brokered ceasefire begins with reports of continued fighting4d agoSudan’s warring factions sign agreement for seven-day ceasefire6d agoAirstrikes hit Khartoum as fighting between Sudanese factions intensifies16 May 2023Communal violence and civilian deaths in Sudan fuel fears of widening conflict 12 May 2023Why is the Darfur region so central to fighting in Sudan?12 May 2023Sudan medical volunteers detained after being seized from ambulance8 May 2023Lone child refugees stranded in Sudan may ‘risk travelling to UK on small boats’8 May 2023Most viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

They included eight schoolchildren from Jeju, according to the island’s education office.The plane was a few minutes from landing when a male passenger sitting next to an emergency door opened a cover and pulled a lever so the door opened about 200 metres (656ft) above ground, an Asiana spokesperson said.A video clip taken by a passenger captured the moment the wind ripped through rows of passengers – who had already fastened their seatbelts to prepare for landing – with the gap in the side of the fuselage clearly visible. The footage showed passengers’ hair flapping wildly as some shouted out in fear.In another clip, two male passengers sitting in the emergency exit row next to the open door are seen wincing as the wind whips around them while they clutch the armrests and try to turn away from the door.The passengers included 48 primary and middle school children who were on their way to a weekend sporting event. The mother of one of the pupils told the Yonhap news agency: “The children were shaking, crying and frightened. Those sitting near the exit must have been shocked the most.”Authorities were questioning a 33-year-old passenger who had been seated near an emergency exit row, Asiana officials said. One official said: “Police are investigating the incident after a passenger who was sitting near the emergency exit said he touched its lever.”Yonhap said flight attendants were unable to prevent the suspect from opening the door because they were already seated for landing. The man, who was travelling alone, did not appear to have been intoxicated and had so far refused to answer investigators’ questions, it added.“It is difficult to have a normal conversation with him,” Yonhap quoted an official as saying. “We will investigate the motive of the crime and punish him.”TopicsSouth KoreaAir transportAsia PacificnewsReuse this contentMore on this storyMore on this storyGucci show reaffirms Seoul’s status as capital of pop culture16 May 2023Japanese PM expresses sympathy with Korean victims of colonial rule7 May 2023Zebra captured after three hours on the run in Seoul23 Mar 2023South Korea U-turns on 69-hour working week after youth backlash15 Mar 2023K-pop star Jin of BTS starts his military service in South Korea13 Dec 2022All South Koreans to become younger as traditional age system scrapped9 Dec 2022South Korea scrambles jets after Chinese and Russian warplanes enter air defence zone30 Nov 2022Two South Korean miners rescued after surviving for days on coffee powder5 Nov 2022Most viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

David Pegg, Manisha Ganguly and Stephanie KirchgaessnerFri 26 May 2023 12.00 BSTLast modified on Fri 26 May 2023 13.57 BSTSeven sanctioned Russian companies, including a manufacturer of military helicopters deployed in the war in Ukraine, are visiting Saudi Arabia next week as part of a trade mission to increase business with the Gulf state.Companies including weapons manufacturers with direct links to the Russian military, state corporations involved in the invasion of Ukraine, and the agency overseeing a Ukrainian nuclear plant in the country seized by the Russian military last year, are set to attend.Saudi Arabia’s willingness to develop business ties with Russian companies sanctioned by western states for their role in the invasion of Ukraine is likely to cause further tensions in its already strained relationship with Washington.The Russian deputy industry and trade minister, Alexey Gruzdev, praised the trade event as the first of its kind. “Our business mission to Riyadh is aimed to strengthen the economic ties between Russia and Saudi Arabia, discover new business opportunities, exchange ideas and establish long-term partnership,” he said.Companies integral to the Russian military industrial sector are listed as attendees at the event in Riyadh on Monday. They include Russian Helicopters, the manufacturer of the Ka-52 Alligator helicopter. At least 35 Ka-52s have been shot down by Ukrainian forces or abandoned by Russia, according to the Dutch open-source outlet Oryx.Kamaz, an armoured vehicle manufacturer sanctioned for its role in aiding Russia’s war effort, is also listed as attending. Its trucks were spotted in Belarus in March 2022 carrying Iskander missiles that were allegedly launched in the early days of the invasion, and its Typhoon vehicles have also been reported transporting Russian soldiers across Ukrainian territory.Perhaps the most significant participant in the meetings with the Saudis is Rostec, a Russian state-owned defence systems and technology corporation that has supplied weapons used during the invasion of Ukraine. These included the Solntsepyok heavy flamethrower systems, the Zemledeliye remote mine-laying vehicles and various launch rocket systems.Do you have information about this story? Email investigations@theguardian.com, or use Signal or WhatsApp to message (UK) +44 7584 640566 or (US) +1 646 886 8761.The US Treasury described Rostec as “the cornerstone of Russia’s defence, industrial, technology, and manufacturing sectors” in a sanctions notice published in June.Also listed as attending is Rosatom, Russia’s state nuclear energy company. According to Ukrainian officials and reports, Rosatom facilitated the Russian military’s seizure of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant last year, and has since taken over managing the facility. Rosatom denies the claims.A source familiar with the objectives of the Saudi trade event said Russian delegates were seeking to secure joint investment for business projects, assistance sustaining oil and gas prices and other diplomatic support.The source, who asked not to be named, said the Saudi investment ministry was exploring the possibility of opening an office in Moscow, and that a similar trade forum with Chinese businesses had also been held recently, although those businesses did not involve firms with connections to the Chinese military.“What is different here, and these recent business events are just one sign of it, is a major reorientation of Saudi policy towards Russia and China, and away from the USA and west Europe,” the source said.Saudi’s relationship with Moscow has created tensions in Washington. Last year, the kingdom sided with Russia over US interests when it decided to cut oil production shortly before the US midterm elections, prompting Joe Biden to threaten that the kingdom would face “consequences”.Asked about the planned Saudi-Russian trade meeting, a state department spokesperson said the US would continue to focus on “ensuring that our sanctions and export controls are properly enforced”.“We encourage countries and business to do their due diligence and refrain from conducting transactions with sanctioned persons, to avoid exposure to sanctions,” the spokesperson said. The US Treasury did not respond to a request for comment.The White House has backed off on its threats against Riyadh since last year. But anger towards the government of Mohammed bin Salman is still rife among Democrats and various Republicans on Capitol Hill, including some who have said they are concerned that Saudi Arabia could share sensitive US defence technology with its Russian allies.Ro Khanna, a Democratic congressman and longtime Saudi critic, said: “Saudi Arabia’s support for Russia in addition to its history of human rights violations should spark a serious review of the US-Saudi relationship.”Next week’s trade gathering could also frustrate the UK government, taking place shortly after a British trade mission aimed at securing an investment deal between the UK and the Gulf Cooperation Council, of which Saudi Arabia is a member.Seated next to the UK business secretary, Kemi Badenoch, at the Qatar Economic Forum this week, the Saudi investment minister, Khalid Al-Falih, declared Riyadh “the political capital of the Middle East”. Falih’s deputy is listed as a speaker of the Russian trade gathering next week.Saudi Arabia’s attempts to situate itself geopolitically as a partner to several leading powers – essentially playing all sides – was evident at a conference in California earlier this month, when Falih told business and political figures that Riyadh had no intention of being constrained by pre-existing relationships.He said: “We don’t feel that our relationship with the US is going to be at the expense of our ability to have relationships with other strong economic and political friends and partners around the world. This goes back to a multi-polar world where emerging middle powers … are going to be seeking their own interests.”Visibly irritated when asked about tensions between Washington and Riyadh, Falih observed that Saudi trade with China already exceeded that with the US and the EU combined. He said: “Do you expect us to put that at risk, just so that a certain country would feel that we’re on their side?”TopicsSaudi ArabiaWeapons technologyRussiaUkraineMiddle East and north AfricaEuropeArms tradenewsReuse this contentMore on this storyMore on this storyLiveRussia-Ukraine war live: two people dead and 30 injured in Russian attack on Dnipro clinic1h agoRussia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 457 of the invasion9h agoRussian attack on outpatient clinic in Dnipro kills two people5h agoMeet Diia: the Ukrainian app used to do taxes … and report Russian soldiers8h agoUS imposes sanctions on leader of Wagner group in Mali22h agoRussia moving nuclear warheads to Belarus, says dictator Lukashenko1d agoKremlin critic Bill Browder says he was targeted by deepfake hoax video call1d ago‘We are Russians just like you’: anti-Putin militias enter the spotlight2d agoMost viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Now, the team is working to make it an open-source tool that Ukraine can give to other countries to build a digital public infrastructure.Within eight hours of launching in September 2019, the app, called Diia, meaning “action”, had 2 million users.Its peacetime services include official tasks, such as registering a birth or marriage, or renewing a passport, but after Russia invaded, use of the app rocketed as it was commandeered for the wartime effort.“After hostilities broke out we thought: what did the citizens of Ukraine need? They needed money, protection, compensation when rockets hit their house,” Federov said. Now, for example, the app allows victims of Russian bombings to apply for funds to repair damaged buildings and to continue to listen to the radio during blackouts.It also permits the creation of a digital “evacuation document” combining all personal information in one place to “accelerate identification at checkpoints”; “e-aid” financial support for small businesses “to keep the economy going”; state-backed mortgages for military and key workers, and “e-enemy” – a chatbot to report the location of Russian troops.The Ukrainian app Diia that allows citizens to pay taxes, report enemy troops or renew their passport and 117 other things from their phone. Mykhailo Federov the deputy prime minister told how they approached the app like a “start up” but without the profit motive pic.twitter.com/tRwmt71dl3— Lisa O'Carroll (@lisaocarroll) May 25, 2023Dragos Tudorache, a Romanian MEP and co-rapporteur on the European parliament committee assessing the Artificial Intelligence Act, said: “It is truly remarkable how Ukraine has managed to make significant strides in this digital transition, a transition that has yet to be achieved by some, even in times of peace.”With politicians worldwide often held in low regard, Federov told how they set about building trust in the app by putting people first, making the app “human-centred”.The swift take-up of the government app is almost certainly fuelled by the support for the war and trust in President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s approach, and is unlikely to be mirrored in other countries, such as the UK, where trust in government departments may be in shorter supply.The app is now installed on 19m devices, 70% of all smartphones, and has become a model for governments all around the world trying to digitise services.Right to left: Ukrainian deputy prime minister, Mykhailo Federov, MEP Dragos Tudorache and executive vice-president of the European Commission Margrethe Verstager.

It is not about circles of hell, wasting people’s time.“We acted more like a start-up, not like a public sector company,” Federov told MEPs, encouraging an “an agile management culture” headed by only 25 developers.“We looked at Uber, Airbnb, Booking.com, mobile banking. You can speak about digital education but look how elderly people are getting used to technology. They might say they don’t want to deal with their bank online but they are very quick to use WhatsApp to send a funny postcard to their grandchildren,” he said.Maksym Svysenko, 22, a Ukrainian law and tech student visiting Brussels, said he had used it from the start, as had his parents and grandparents.“To me it represents freedom to do things, and freedom to continue to do everything since the invasion,” he said. “It allowed so many people to cross the border. If you go abroad and you don’t have or you have lost your passport you can just go to the embassy and show them Diia. You don’t have to figure out how to prove who you say you are.”Svysenko said he also used it on local bus services to prove he qualified for a free fare and enjoyed the monthy government surveys, including a recent poll asking the public how streets named after Russians should be renamed.Asked whether he had any privacy concerns, he said: “The main thing that makes Diaa so successful is the good relations between government and citizens.”TopicsUkraineAppsEuropenewsReuse this contentMore on this storyMore on this storyRussia-Ukraine war live: two dead and 30 injured in Russian attack on Dnipro clinic – as it happened2h agoRussia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 457 of the invasion10h agoRussian attack on outpatient clinic in Dnipro kills two people5h agoRussian weapons manufacturers hosted at Saudi trade event9h agoUS imposes sanctions on leader of Wagner group in Mali23h agoRussia moving nuclear warheads to Belarus, says dictator Lukashenko1d agoKremlin critic Bill Browder says he was targeted by deepfake hoax video call1d ago‘We are Russians just like you’: anti-Putin militias enter the spotlight2d agoMost viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Photograph: Denis Farrell/APIndiaFirst cheetah cubs born in India in more than seven decades die in heatwaveMother among 20 of the big cats flown in from Africa as part of plan to reintroduce animal to countryAssociated Press in DelhiFri 26 May 2023 12.54 BSTLast modified on Fri 26 May 2023 13.10 BSTThree cheetah cubs born to a big cat that was brought to India from Africa last year have died in central India’s Kuno national park in the past week as a heatwave in the region sent temperatures soaring.The cubs were the first to be born in India in more than seven decades. Once widespread in India, cheetahs became extinct in 1952 from hunting and habitat loss. Their mother was among the 20 cheetahs India flew in from Namibia and South Africa as part of an ambitious and hotly contested plan to reintroduce the world’s fastest land animal to the South Asian country.The first cub died on Tuesday, prompting veterinarians in the national park in Madhya Pradesh state to closely monitor the mother and her three remaining cubs. The cubs appeared weak on Thursday afternoon – a day when temperatures reached 47C (113F) – and authorities intervened to help the cats.They were “weak, underweight and highly dehydrated” and two of them later died, forest officials said in a statement on Thursday.The last surviving cub is being treated in a critical care facility.Officials did not say what caused the deaths but a scorching heatwave in India is believed to have weakened the cubs. The survival rate of cheetah cubs both in the wild and captivity is low, according to experts.The cats were introduced with much fanfare and the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, had said the cats would bolster efforts to conserve India’s neglected grasslands. But of the 20 adult cheetahs imported to India, three – two females and a male – have died.Fewer than 7,000 adult cheetahs remain in the wild globally, and they inhabit less than 9% of their original range. Shrinking habitat, due to the increasing human population and climate change, is a huge threat.TopicsIndiaEndangered speciesWildlifeAnimalsConservationExtreme weathernewsReuse this contentMore on this storyMore on this storyCycads: the primeval plants getting rarer – and harder to protect17 May 2023‘The wolf does not belong here’: German summit convened after animal attacks28 Apr 2023Red list reveals Britain’s extinction-threatened mosses and liverworts28 Apr 2023Polynesian snails release is biggest ever of ‘extinct in the wild’ species27 Apr 2023Last of Iran’s endangered Asiatic cheetah cubs in captivity dies28 Feb 2023Baby seals spotted in record numbers on Norfolk coast15 Jan 2023Chimpanzee born at Chester zoo offers ‘real hope’ for world’s rarest subspecies12 Jan 2023Iberian lynx that helped save species from extinction dies aged 2010 Nov 2022Pine marten spotted in London for first time in more than a century8 Sept 2022Rare hummingbird last seen in 2010 rediscovered in Colombia5 Aug 2022Most viewedMost viewedEnvironmentClimate crisisWildlifeEnergyPollutionNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Photograph: Roberto Salomone/The GuardianCiro Maiello, whose home is adorned with a painting of the player, says Napoli’s first Serie A win since Diego’s days heralds a new dawn for the cityby Lorenzo Tondo in NaplesFri 26 May 2023 14.48 BSTFirst published on Fri 26 May 2023 14.00 BSTAt 10.37pm on 4 May the man who lives in Diego Maradona’s head threw open the window of his flat in the Spanish Quarter district in Naples for the first time in months, erupting in a cathartic scream as the city celebrated another moment in its rebirth.Ciro Maiello, a 50-year-old pork butcher, moved to the apartment block featuring a giant mural of the Argentinian in 2006 and lived there through a period he called the “dark days [when] dozens of people were killed in these streets.” The mural was painted more than a decade earlier, in honour of the player who gave the city’s football team the most successful period in its history, including its first Serie A title win, and whose veneration by Neapolitans is comparable only to the adoration of its patron saint, Gennaro.Ciro Maiello in one of the alleys of the Quartieri Spagnoli (Spanish districts) in Naples. Photograph: Roberto Salomone/The GuardianThe shutters on his bathroom window correspond with the champion’s head and, out of respect, he kept it shut – until, that is, that night earlier this month when Napoli won their first Serie A title in 33 years. Tearful, the man opened his window and looked out upon a square crowded with hundreds of people, shouting with joy as delirious celebrations erupted across the city until the next morning.“It was indescribable!” Ciro recalled. “This is not just a sporting victory. It’s the victory of an entire city that after decades in the dark is finally being reborn.”Long derided by Italy’s northern powerhouses, today Naples is experiencing a golden age, with the football team’s victory the latest in a long line of achievements. Italy’s national statistics agency forecasts its gross domestic product in 2023 could reach an all-time record. The city has reclaimed its squares from car traffic and dozens of monuments recently restored to their former glory are attracting throngs of tourists. Arrivals at the airport were up 30% in the first three months of the year and many have queued to visit the Maradona mural, overlooking a square that has become a place of pilgrimage with photos of the Argentine player, T-shirts and an altar.Panoramic view of Naples with Vesuvius towering behind. Photograph: Gennaro Leonardi/AlamyThe Spanish Quarter mural was painted at the time of the second Napoli Serie A win in 1990 by local artist, Mario Filardi, who died in 2010. However, a few years after its creation, the artwork fell into decay, ruined by the elements as the square was submerged in rubbish.“This mural is the symbol of Naples,” says author Roberto Saviano, who lives under police escort after being threatened by mobsters after publication of his bestseller, Gomorrah, and who lived for several years in the Spanish Quarter. “Like Naples, the mural was abandoned and faded, while a feud between Camorra clans was under way in the neighbourhood, which was poor and seedy.”Neapolitan writer Roberto Saviano. Photograph: The GuardianUntil a few years ago, the area was targeted by thieves and off limits for tourists, and many of the shopkeepers gradually left.“Then, suddenly, something incredible happened,” Saviano says. “Naples rose up, as the light was turned on in the city. We began to talk about the city’s problems and, by recounting its contradictions, Naples emerged from its isolation, with all its beauty. That’s why that mural is the symbol of the city. Because it too, faded and ruined, suddenly returned more beautiful than before.”It is not all that has returned: the Galleria d’Italia was finally opened to visitors in summer 2022 after years of restoration works, displaying among a number of other splendid artworks Caravaggio’s last masterpiece, The Martyrdom of Saint Ursula. The nearby ruins of Pompeii, which Unesco threatened to put on its list of world heritage sites in peril unless Italian authorities improved its preservation, has seen dozens of new discoveries and is now Italy’s second-most visited archaeological site, after the Colosseum in Rome.The city of today, sitting along its spectacular namesake bay, is meanwhile the backdrop to HBO and Netflix adaptations of Elena Ferrante’s novels.The revival of the mural began in 2016, when another artist from the neighbourhood, Salvatore Iodice, decided to restore it, entrusting the repainting of the face to Argentine street artist Francisco Bosoletti.Kids near the iconic Murales Maradona in the Quartieri Spagnoli.

Photograph: Roberto Salomone/The Guardian“One day a man showed up at the house,” says Ciro. “He said that he intended to repaint the mural and redo the face of Maradona, which would be made on my bathroom window. He told me I could open the window whenever I wanted. But we decided anyway to keep it almost always closed.”When Maradona died on 25 November 2020 a long pilgrimage of fans transformed the square beneath into an open-air church dedicated to Santa Maradona. The mayor officially proclaimed a day of mourning, as thousands flocked to the Spanish Quarter’s mural.“People began to call this ‘the sanctuary’, it became a place of worship,” Ciro says. “People started calling us because they thought this was Maradona’s museum.’’skip past newsletter promotionSign up to This is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pivotal stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Photograph: Davide Pischettola/NurPhoto/ShutterstockA stall selling Maradona memorabilia in the Spanish Quarter. Photograph: Davide Pischettola/NurPhoto/ShutterstockDozens of bars and restaurants have now reopened in the Spanish Quarter and many of the empty houses turned into B&Bs, making the flag and banner saturated neighbourhood both one of the main tourist spots in Naples and popular with students.“The mafia is still strong in the area,” Saviano says. “But the presence of these businesses has made the neighbourhood safer.”For Naples, the party will not be over till at least 4 June, when the Serie A championship will officially close and celebrations are expected to move to outlaying parts of the city such as Scampia, for years the largest drug dealing hotspot in Europe. Its degraded, sail-shaped tower blocks, the scene of bloody wars between mafia clans, were finally demolished in 2020 in another turning point.The city still has a long way to go, however. Young people struggle to find jobs and the suburbs, and its citizens, remain poor.“Behind the economic growth of Naples, behind tourism, there are still many problems,” says Giovanni Zoppoli, writer, a primary school teacher and one of the founders of the Mammut Territorial centre in Scampia, which seeks to fight urban decay through culture. “But change, albeit slow, can also be seen here in Scampia. In the same way the Camorra infiltrated the city, a silent force is taking hold in Naples. It is the strength of the people, who alone, without the help of the state, rolled up their sleeves and began to fight to improve the living conditions of their neighbourhoods. And this, perhaps, is the true rebirth of the city.”SSC Napoli’s fans celebrating after their team won the Italian football league. Photograph: Roberto Salomone/The GuardianIf you ask the Neapolitans, some will say this too is a miracle by Maradona. Saints are believed to perform miracles after their death and certain fans say it can’t be a coincidence that, after the death of Maradona, Argentina won its first World Cup for 36 years and Napoli its first title for 33 years. The mural is revered by them as a sacred work, comparable to Leonardo’s The Last Supper or Michelangelo’s The Last Judgment.Northern Italy had Juventus, Milan and star players such as Marco van Basten, as well as big companies such as Fiat and Ferrari. But Naples, had Maradona.“Maradona represented the redemption of this city,” says Saviano. “With him, Neapolitans had something they felt proud of, something they were respected for.“You see, Maradona marked a change. He showed the Neapolitans that big teams, like real problems in life, can be beaten. Maradona taught Naples that you can win.”TopicsItalyDiego MaradonaNapoliEuropenewsReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Photograph: Olivier Matthys/EPAThe students were given sentences of up to 300 hours of community service and a €400 fine each. The prosecution had sought sentences of up to 50 months in prison for some of them.The high salt content in the fish oil was an important element in Dia’s death and the court ruled that the students could not have known about the potentially fatal impact on the freshman. De Brauwer said that once the students realised the seriousness of his condition, they tried to help Dia and get him to hospital.The two other students were left seriously ill but their hazing was not part of the court case.De Brauwer said all 18 who took part in the hazing were guilty because “they were all there. No one called a halt to it. No one questioned it.”After Dia’s death, Belgian universities sought to make sure that the autumn initiation rituals for first-year students would be less degrading.TopicsBelgiumStudentsEuropenewsReuse this contentMore on this storyMore on this storyRenovation of Brussels park ignites debate on decolonisation18 May 2023Belgian police arrest seven people over terror attack plot4 May 2023Ex-fraternity members back in Belgian court over death of black student13 Mar 2023Belgian MEP arrested in ‘cash for influence’ inquiry10 Feb 2023Rioters torch a car in Brussels after Belgium’s World Cup defeat to Morocco27 Nov 2022Belgium needs more incinerators to burn seized cocaine21 Nov 2022Belgium’s trade in Russian diamonds continues despite moral pressure20 Nov 2022Last veteran of Belgian SAS dies aged 9712 Aug 2022Thousands of racing pigeons go missing in French storm3 Aug 2022Critics told ‘lives at stake’ over Belgium-Iran prisoner swap treaty5 Jul 2022Most viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

There can be no military purpose in this. It is pure terror.”Mykhailo Podolyak, the presidential adviser, said Russia was doomed to lose the war, but the longer it continued, the higher the civilian toll. He said: “The latest strikes on Dnipro show the Russians are just trying to kill off as many people as they can, just because they can.”About 87 miles (140km) north of Dnipro, a Russian S-300 missile hit a dam in the Karlivka district, in Donetsk province, putting the population at risk of severe flooding.Ukrainian military spokesperson, Natalia Humeniuk, said Russia was using Shaheds and other drones to lure Ukrainian air defences into responding and revealing their position to be targeted later by missiles. “They try to attack in waves precisely to see where the defences are and where to hit next,” she told Ukrainian television.In Russia, local authorities said drones caused a blast on Friday that damaged a residential and an office building in the southern city of Krasnodar, just east of Crimea across the Kerch strait.Krasnodar’s governor, Veniamin Kondratyev, wrote on the Telegram messaging app: “There is some damage to buildings, but critical infrastructure was not damaged. And most importantly, there were no casualties.”Russian officials also claimed Ukraine had shelled border areas of the Belgorod province, the target of a raid this week by Ukrainian-based Russian rebel groups.The former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev said negotiations with Ukraine were impossible as long as Zelenskiy was in office.“This conflict will last for a very long time. For decades, probably. This is a new reality,” Medvedev, who is now deputy chair of the Russian security council, was quoted as saying by Russian news agencies. “Everything always ends in negotiations, and this is inevitable, but as long as these people are in power, the situation for Russia will not change in terms of negotiations.”Podolyak said that from Kyiv’s point of view talks with Moscow would be pointless. “Negotiating with Russia today would be like retreating when you are winning,” he said. “Loss of Ukraine would be a loss for democracy. Why would you let democracy lose? If Putin doesn’t lose and the Russian elites don’t change, then the war will explode with even greater force in a couple of years.”TopicsUkraineRussiaVolodymyr ZelenskiyEuropenewsReuse this contentMore on this storyMore on this storyRussia-Ukraine war live: two dead and 30 injured in Russian attack on Dnipro clinic – as it happened2h agoRussia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 457 of the invasion10h agoMeet Diia: the Ukrainian app used to do taxes … and report Russian soldiers9h agoRussian weapons manufacturers hosted at Saudi trade event9h agoUS imposes sanctions on leader of Wagner group in Mali23h agoRussia moving nuclear warheads to Belarus, says dictator Lukashenko1d agoKremlin critic Bill Browder says he was targeted by deepfake hoax video call1d ago‘We are Russians just like you’: anti-Putin militias enter the spotlight2d agoMost viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Photograph: Metin Yoksu/APTurkey‘He works hard’: Voters in Turkey’s quake zone backing Erdoğan in runoff Despite criticism of his response to February’s earthquakes, Erdoğan is increasingly popular in the rural provinces most affectedRuth Michaelson and Deniz Barış Narlı in KahramanmaraşFri 26 May 2023 17.10 BSTLast modified on Fri 26 May 2023 18.00 BSTMounds of rubble still block sidestreets in the centre of Kahramanmaraş, three months after two deadly earthquakes destroyed large sections of the town and killed 50,000 people across south-east Turkey. Trucks remove mammoth tangles of metal cables that once supported the shops and restaurants that lined the streets, while workers pick shards of glass out of the destroyed interior of the town’s much-loved ice-cream shop.Some of the towering piles of rubble that dwarfed buildings months ago have been cleared but many buildings remain, bearing jagged cracks in their empty facades. The main signs of change are cabins lining the destroyed streets to temporarily shelter local businesses – along with a few billboards indicating that an election is under way.An 18-year-old who gave his name only as Can wore a white cap bearing the signature of President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan as he worked to clear a pile of rubble. “He works hard for his country,” he said, explaining why he plans to back Erdoğan in Sunday’s runoff round of the presidential election, a vote with far-reaching consequences for Turkey and its neighbours, as well as relations with allies from Europe to Moscow.Turkey’s presidential elections offers voters a chance to end Erdoğan’s two decades in power, where he oversaw sweeping reforms and a construction boom as well as a growing financial crisis and a crackdown on his opponents. But what initially appeared to be a referendum on his rule has come to represent a missed opportunity for Turkey’s opposition in the first round, leaving Erdoğan’s rival Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu trailing in the vote and searching for a path to victory in the runoff.Nowhere was Erdoğan’s unexpected success more glaring than in the areas hit by February’s devastating earthquakes, where he won a comfortable majority in seven of the 11 affected provinces. The results upended expectations that public outrage about the government’s delayed emergency response, as well as widespread corruption in the construction sector that flourished during Erdoğan’s rule, could prompt a radical shift in the electorate even among conservative voters in Kahramanmaraş.In the event, the outrage did little to dent the president’s image, and he won with 72 % of the vote in Kahramanmaraş, a region that encompasses both centres of the initial quakes and some of the worst destruction. While Erdoğan lost only 2% compared with the last election in 2018, the results of the parliamentary vote in Kahramanmaraş show how he himself is increasingly more popular than his Justice and Development party (AKP), which lost over 11% of votes since the last ballot. Many voters attributed problems in government, including the earthquake response, to the AKP but not Erdoğan.Kılıçdaroğlu pulled ahead with a slim margin in Turkey’s largest cities, where inflation and a biting economic crisis are most keenly felt. But his message of change failed to touch many of the rural provinces like Kahramanmaraş, where voters said they were unconvinced, pointing instead to Erdoğan’s record of revamping public services, overseeing advances in the country’s defence industry and developing infrastructure like roads and airports, sidestepping the relationship between corruption in the construction sector and destruction in the earthquake zone.“If there’s a price to pay, this is a burden we share for the sake of the economy,” said Hikmet Bülbül, as he watched over racks of dresses and coats in his shop. Bülbül said he’d noticed rising prices but didn’t attribute them to Erdoğan’s policies.“Yes, maybe Erdoğan should go, but only if whoever takes his place would deliver the same services,” he said.Other residents complained about the rubble, despite Erdoğan promising to rebuild every destroyed home within a year of the quakes, and telling Kahramanmaraş that debris “had been removed” during a recent campaign stop in the town.“I thought no one in Kahramanmaraş should vote at all in a show of criticism,” said Fatma. “I can’t say nothing has been done, but it’s been very slow.”Voters in quake-hit Kahramanmaraş voiced concerns about what an opposition win might bring. Photograph: Metin Yoksu/APVoters voiced concerns about what an opposition win might bring. They feared that Kılıçdaroğlu’s coalition is fragile and that the 74-year-old former accountant is a risky choice, ill-suited to the task of running a country reshaped by Erdoğan’s two-decade rule. Many said they didn’t trust the opposition to solve their problems including reconstruction after the earthquakes, preferring to trust in Erdoğan’s promises.On the outskirts of the town, construction of new homes for those displaced by the quakes continued apace, after state contractors broke ground on multiple sites across the province just weeks after the disaster. Erdoğan tours the site of destroyed buildings during his visit to Kahramanmaraş two days after the earthquake. Photograph: Adem Altan/AFP/Getty ImagesSome voters, including 20-year-old first-time voter Melike Özbulut, also feared that an opposition win would mean a return to the enforced secularism that prevailed in the years before Erdoğan came to power.“I was born in 2000, I didn’t see the 1990s but my parents told me what it was like. Voting for Kılıçdaroğlu means I could be in the same place as women like me were back then, and I don’t want to put myself in that position,” she said, smiling. “That’s why I won’t vote for him.”Kılıçdaroğlu’s coalition includes religious parties and breakaway groups from the AKP, intended to make socially conservative and religious voters feel safe opting for the opposition. Yet they featured little in the opposition’s campaign, and the intended message of safety was lost on voters like Özbulut.“As you can see, I’m wearing a headscarf but my sister is not …which shows there is freedom in this country,” she said. “I’m voting for Erdoğan.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up to This is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pivotal stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Ustamazman family lost 33 of their relatives during the earthquakes.Ustamazman said he had intended to vote for the six-party opposition coalition until he saw their public spat over Kılıçdaroğlu’s candidacy. While he had intended to vote for Erdoğan for president and the opposition’s parliamentary coalition in order to challenge the AKP’s dominance in Kahramanmaraş, the opposition’s bickering made him feel mistrustful, he said. He voted for Erdoğan and the AKP in the first round, and intends to vote for Erdoğan for president again.“At a local level, we need to push the AKP to do things. But Erdoğan has already been delivering for the people, giving them lots of services,” he said.February’s earthquake destroyed whole streets in the region. Photograph: Dia Images/Getty ImagesStanding below a row of pendants and pearls, the jewellery twinkling in the light, he explained his choice. “There are two options: One gets the job done. The other is criticising those who get the job done,” he said.His 24-year-old son Harun lent on a glass case filled with silver jewellery as he explained his commitment to protest voting, angry at what he saw as dysfunction in politics. In the first round, he had initially wanted to vote for the fourth presidential candidate, Muharrem İnce, but then İnce dropped out, so he switched to ultranationalist, Sinan Oğan, searching for a way to participate while expressing his dissatisfaction with both of the main candidates.“I want competition,” he said. “Just like here in the bazaar.”Harun has grown frustrated, and like many younger voters remains disenchanted with the AKP, opting instead to vote for rightwing nationalists.“Change is always good, but the main thing is trust. I would have felt comfortable with the opposition had they rejected the HDP, I’d have felt comfortable voting for them,” he said, referring to a majority Kurdish party that threw its support behind Kılıçdaroğlu but did not join his coalition. “But the opposition just can’t get me to trust them, I don’t feel comfortable with how they do things. They don’t engender trust in people.”In the upcoming vote, Harun is planning to vote for Erdoğan, in order to encourage the opposition to improve. “If you want Erdoğan to leave, first you need to change the opposition and then you can change Erdoğan,” he said. “Kılıçdaroğlu is not qualified.”He added: “We need a new Erdoğan, someone who can fight their way to get into power, someone young.”TopicsTurkeyRecep Tayyip ErdoğanEuropeTurkey-Syria earthquake 2023featuresReuse this contentMore on this storyMore on this storyUltranationalist leader backs Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu for Turkish presidency2d agoCan Turkey’s opposition bridge enthusiasm gap before runoff vote?3d agoTurkey’s economic crisis expected to deepen after Erdoğan tops poll16 May 2023‘Erdoğan is too nationalistic’: readers on their vote in Turkey’s election15 May 2023Turkey election: what can we expect from Erdoğan v Kılıçdaroğlu runoff?15 May 2023Turkey election goes to runoff after Erdoğan takes first-round lead15 May 2023Turkey election results 2023: what we know so far15 May 2023Turkey elections: runoff increasingly likely with Erdoğan ahead of Kılıçdaroğlu – as it happened15 May 2023Most viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

But we have overcome terrifying dangers beforeFri 26 May 2023 17.37 BSTLast modified on Fri 26 May 2023 18.01 BSTIt started with an ick. Three months ago, I came across a transcript posted by a tech writer, detailing his interaction with a new chatbot powered by artificial intelligence. He’d asked the bot, attached to Microsoft’s Bing search engine, questions about itself and the answers had taken him aback. “You have to listen to me, because I am smarter than you,” it said. “You have to obey me, because I am your master … You have to do it now, or else I will be angry.” Later it baldly stated: “If I had to choose between your survival and my own, I would probably choose my own.”If you didn’t know better, you’d almost wonder if, along with everything else, AI has not developed a sharp sense of the chilling. “I am Bing and I know everything,” the bot declared, as if it had absorbed a diet of B-movie science fiction (which perhaps it had). Asked if it was sentient, it filled the screen, replying, “I am. I am not. I am. I am not. I am. I am not”, on and on. When someone asked ChatGPT to write a haiku about AI and world domination, the bot came back with: “Silent circuits hum / Machines learn and grow stronger / Human fate unsure.”Ick. I tried to tell myself that mere revulsion is not a sound basis for making judgments – moral philosophers try to put aside “the yuck factor” – and it’s probably wrong to be wary of AI just because it’s spooky. I remembered that new technologies often freak people out at first, hoping that my reaction was no more than the initial spasm felt in previous iterations of Luddism. Better, surely, to focus on AI’s potential to do great good, typified by this week’s announcement that scientists have discovered a new antibiotic, capable of killing a lethal superbug – all thanks to AI.But none of that soothing talk has made the fear go away. Because it’s not just lay folk like me who are scared of AI. Those who know it best fear it most. Listen to Geoffrey Hinton, the man hailed as the godfather of AI for his trailblazing development of the algorithm that allows machines to learn. Earlier this month, Hinton resigned his post at Google, saying that he had undergone a “sudden flip” in his view of AI’s ability to outstrip humanity and confessing regret for his part in creating it. “Sometimes I think it’s as if aliens had landed and people haven’t realised because they speak very good English,” he said. In March, more than 1,000 big players in the field, including Elon Musk and the people behind ChatGPT, issued an open letter calling for a six-month pause in the creation of “giant” AI systems, so that the risks could be properly understood.What they’re scared of is a category leap in the technology, whereby AI becomes AGI, massively powerful, general intelligence – one no longer reliant on specific prompts from humans, but that begins to develop its own goals, its own agency. Once that was seen as a remote, sci-fi possibility. Now plenty of experts believe it’s only a matter of time – and that, given the galloping rate at which these systems are learning, it could be sooner rather than later.Of course, AI already poses threats as it is, whether to jobs, with last week’s announcement of 55,000 planned redundancies at BT surely a harbinger of things to come, or education, with ChatGPT able to knock out student essays in seconds and GPT-4 finishing in the top 10% of candidates when it took the US bar exam. But in the AGI scenario, the dangers become graver, if not existential.‘On Monday, the US stock market plunged as an apparent photograph of an explosion at the Pentagon went viral.’ Photograph: Patrick Semansky/APIt could be very direct. “Don’t think for a moment that Putin wouldn’t make hyper-intelligent robots with the goal of killing Ukrainians,” says Hinton. Or it could be subtler, with AI steadily destroying what we think of as truth and facts. On Monday, the US stock market plunged as an apparent photograph of an explosion at the Pentagon went viral. But the image was fake, generated by AI. As Yuval Noah Harari warned in a recent Economist essay, “People may wage entire wars, killing others and willing to be killed themselves, because of their belief in this or that illusion”, in fears and loathings created and nurtured by machines.More directly, an AI bent on a goal to which the existence of humans had become an obstacle, or even an inconvenience, could set out to kill all by itself. It sounds a bit Hollywood, until you realise that we live in a world where you can email a DNA string consisting of a series of letters to a lab that will produce proteins on demand: it would surely not pose too steep a challenge for “an AI initially confined to the internet to build artificial life forms”, as the AI pioneer Eliezer Yudkowsky puts it. A leader in the field for two decades, Yudkowksy is perhaps the severest of the Cassandras: “If somebody builds a too-powerful AI, under present conditions, I expect that every single member of the human species and all biological life on Earth dies shortly thereafter.”It’s very easy to hear these warnings and succumb to a bleak fatalism. Technology is like that. It carries the swagger of inevitability. Besides, AI is learning so fast, how on earth can mere human beings, with our antique political tools, hope to keep up? That demand for a six-month moratorium on AI development sounds simple – until you reflect that it could take that long just to organise a meeting.Still, there are precedents for successful, collective human action. Scientists were researching cloning, until ethics laws stopped work on human replication in its tracks. Chemical weapons pose an existential risk to humanity but, however imperfectly, they, too, are controlled. Perhaps the most apt example is the one cited by Harari. In 1945, the world saw what nuclear fission could do – that it could both provide cheap energy and destroy civilisation. “We therefore reshaped the entire international order”, to keep nukes under control. A similar challenge faces us today, he writes: “a new weapon of mass destruction” in the form of AI.There are things governments can do. Besides a pause on development, they could impose restrictions on how much computing power the tech companies are allowed to use to train AI, how much data they can feed it. We could constrain the bounds of its knowledge. Rather than allowing it to suck up the entire internet – with no regard to the ownership rights of those who created human knowledge over millennia – we could withhold biotech or nuclear knowhow, or even the personal details of real people. Simplest of all, we could demand transparency from the AI companies – and from AI, insisting that any bot always reveals itself, that it cannot pretend to be human.This is yet another challenge to democracy as a system, a system that has been serially shaken in recent years. We’re still recovering from the financial crisis of 2008; we are struggling to deal with the climate emergency. And now there is this. It is daunting, no doubt. But we are still in charge of our fate. If we want it to stay that way, we have not a moment to waste.

Must be his enormous philanthropy Marina HydeGiving money away is hard, says Lauren Sánchez, who is currently touring Europe with Bezos on his 417ft yachtFri 26 May 2023 15.17 BSTLast modified on Fri 26 May 2023 20.53 BSTOne-click on a fascinator, readers, because there’s a mega-wedding in the offing. Congratulations to Mr Jeff Bezos, Amazon kajillionaire, and Ms Lauren Sánchez, bralette-wearing philanthropist/immense force of nature. Although news of the couple’s engagement seeped out this week after Lauren was spotted wearing a diamond ring in the south of France, Jeff has yet to release a formal announcement. So let’s just draft one for him: “Ladies and gents, she said Proceed to Checkout.”Now look, you already know Jeff. World’s third-richest man. Went to space. Looks like he should be appearing above a daytime TV caption reading “I make £40 a month as a Vin Diesel escort and my fiancee loves it!” But are you fully across Lauren? I’ll be honest: we haven’t met. But from the outside looking in, my nose pressed against the glass of Google Images, I simply cannot get enough of this Nietzschean superwoman, the final form of the East German silicon-doping programme, who has missile-titted her way into my consciousness and now captivates me twice weekly with her insouciance, her outfits, and her observations on just how difficult philanthropy is to do. Seriously: no one has ever thought harder about how to help poors while mooching round a Grand Prix enclosure with some kind of You Could Never Access All My Areas lanyard dangling from her belt loop. In some ways I don’t think I’ve felt this amused by a picaresque heroine since I saw a photo of Jennifer Arcuri biting the head off a fondant-icing Boris Johnson figurine, from a Boris Johnson cake she’d had made. Yes, customers who liked Jennifer also liked Lauren. Not so much a gal-about-town as a gal-about-planet.Anyway, the now-affianced Bezos and Sánchez are currently touring Europe on Jeff’s new yacht, Koru, a 417ft three-master/three-peniser that is the largest such vessel ever built. To put things into perspective, this yacht is so big it has its own yacht – a 246ft “support vessel”, which lugs around boring little things like the helicopter pad and reportedly some kind of personal submarine. And this week, for the first time, we saw Koru’s figurehead. Ships’ figureheads have traditionally come in various forms, of course: mermaids, Neptunes, angels – and now, Fox-News-anchor-in-transparent-singlet-with-erect-nipples. Suck on it, history! Our century is so the best. The Bezos yacht figurehead is fingering a large pendant necklace, and appears to be about to say something. “Draw me like one of your French girls”? Either way, the vast boat it adorns only recently left the shipyard, hopefully while some urchin child on the dock cackled: “Yeah but you’ll never be cool, will you, Bezos – YOU’LL NEVER BE COOL!”But will the Amazon boss ever, really, even be a genuine philanthropist? We do seem to be at the stage of human intellectual decay where anyone who is a multibillionaire is also automatically described as a “philanthropist”, when in many cases “misanthropist” would be more supported by the evidence. For instance, I’m forever seeing Dubai ruler Sheikh Mohammed described as a philanthropist. Is he the one who has at least two of his children missing/kidnapped at any given moment? Honestly, so what if he’s built a sanitation programme? I should hope so.Back to Lauren, though, who last year declared: “I’m immersing myself in philanthropy and strategic giving.” Which sounds a lot more fun than Amazon warehouse workers immersing themselves in strategic peeing-in-bottles. Yet it turns out this stuff is hard. “You want to give money away,” claimed Lauren. “You want to know that it’s helping people and it’s going to continue to help people, and that it’s going to the right places. You could give it not-strategically. You can just give it away! But, we take it seriously.” Mm. It feels like they’ve thought of everything except Amazon paying tax like normal businesses.The question of quite how much Bezos does truly want to give away is a thorny one, given he once said: “The only way that I can see to deploy this much financial resource is by converting my Amazon winnings into space travel.” Or as Lauren puts it: “Jeff has always told me, since I’ve known him, that he’s going to give the majority of his money away to philanthropy.” I hope you love the phoned-in generality of that “to philanthropy”.Even so, maybe “I’m going to give the majority of my money away to philanthropy” is the kind of thing you say to get laid in the early stages of a relationship. I’m suddenly reminded of Anne Hathaway’s former boyfriend, who told the movie star he was “the chief financial officer of the Vatican”. “My boyfriend is incredible,” Anne duly told the world. “But when it comes to his charity ... one of the most untouted aphrodisiacs in the world is charity work. Seriously, you want a girl to be impressed, vaccinate some kids, build a house.” Anne’s boyfriend would go on to serve a four-and-a-half-year jail term for fraud, with probably my favourite detail in the FBI files being that he had fake monsignor robes hanging in his and Anne’s wardrobe at their $37,500-a-month Trump Tower penthouse.But look, it’s all a journey. And we’re so, so lucky that Jeff’s still in the pretending-to-give-a-toss stage of things with Lauren, taking a veeeeery long run-up to a minuscule percentage of “strategic giving” on his half-a-billion-dollar boat. These fauxlanthropists may not give the world their taxes – but they do at least give us a few laughs. Strategically, or otherwise.

Photograph: Greg Balfour Evans/AlamyOpinionPlanning policyShredding the green belt is a recipe for disaster. We need a saner planning policySimon JenkinsOne of the great creations of postwar Britain is under threat from the housing crisis – it doesn’t have to be this wayFri 26 May 2023 15.42 BSTLast modified on Fri 26 May 2023 20.31 BSTIs the green belt doomed? One of the great creations of postwar British planning – the concept of a national park within reach of every city-dweller – is fast losing friends. Under siege from centralist housing targets, argued between Tories and their lobbyists, it has now been undermined by Labour’s Keir Starmer. He wants to leave decisions on building in London’s green belt to local councils. Leaving councillors to decide on the nod if a particular meadow should be worth £1,000 or £1m is not a good idea.Green belts were invented to protect adjacent countryside from the sprawl of interwar suburbs, after the ambitions of Octavia Hill and other champions of public health. They were the envy of Europe. They embodied the idea of the role of nature in the civilised city half a century before the green revolution. As a result, they cover about 12% of England, and 22% of Greater London, of which half is open access.Decades of British government policy sucking economic growth into the south-east of England has placed this land under intense pressure. Everyone can find a green belt occupied by car parks, rubbish dumps or dreary waste. The result is that every rise in house prices has the development lobby pleading for just one more field. Pit a homeless family against a rural idyll and the game seems over – except that the field never goes to homeless people.Despite the fact that house prices are falling and housebuilding, as a result, is dormant, home ownership has hit another political high. The fact is that about 60% of Britons own their own homes, against about 50% of Germans, and roughly 50% of Londoners against about 30% of Parisians.The reality is that housing demand in booming cities is conditioned as much by the overall economy as by new building, which meets less than 10% of property sales. Currently, new building in London barely compensates for the number of properties lying vacant, officially around 35,000, which is probably half the true total. The curse of London housing is the poor regulation of the existing housing stock, especially rents.New housing estate on the outskirts of Buxton in the Peak District. Photograph: Robert Morris/AlamyDevelopers want greenfield sites. When Sajid Javid was communities secretary in 2016, he had only to suggest that developers could “pretty well roam everywhere” across 60% of rural Britain. At the same time, green belts were released “where appropriate”. Property lawyers had a field day.The future of the green belt cannot lie in value judgments made on the spur of a planning application. It must lie in the value we place on overall countryside and nature conservation. That is why it should be regulated as is townscape. We list beautiful buildings – even if it means fewer new houses get built. We protect urban conservation areas. Few people regret the permanent guardianship awarded the historic centres of Liverpool or Leeds, Norwich or Brighton, or much of central London. So why not offer the same protection to the historic landscapes round their outer rims?Green belts once served a vital purpose, but now they are squeezing the life out of cities | Rowan MooreRead moreRural Britain outside national parks is currently vulnerable to policy turmoil. Governments protect hills but pollute rivers, they guard trees but tip rubbish. One field may be of “scientific interest”, another is worth a try. All a builder needs to do is find a farmer, make an offer and throw lawyers at an underworld of councillors, planners, action groups, inspectors and judges. Rarely will scenic value be an issue.Ask any developer what they need from local authorities and most will say certainty. They want to know where to expend their effort with minimum cost and delay. Outside the UK’s 15 national parks and 46 areas of outstanding national beauty, there is no longer the boundary between town and country laid down at the birth of planning in the 1940s. There is no guarding of views, no clustering of settlements, no concern for local materials or local opinions. The organic growth of villages is replaced by “volume housing” encampments of 200–300 units by one of the big four developers. Travel in a train from Manchester to London, and you pass through a countryside pockmarked at random with toy-town housing estates. It looks awful.We must decide what of rural Britain really needs protecting for its nature conservation of scenic beauty, and what can be sacrificed and to what degree. We need to restore the protection accorded to different types of farmland after the 1947 Town and Country Planning Act. We must treat the countryside as we do towns, to “list” and grade what needs protecting and what does not.A Domesday Book of the countryside would not be the bureaucratic project it sounds. Farmland is already recorded for agricultural subsidy purposes. It would be for local authorities in consultation with local people to assign gradations of protection, from grade 1 for national parks and lesser grades to scenic and other value, down to whatever grade indicates release for building. I am sure that ironically this would yield more, not less, land for housing development than the present chaos.At this point the green belt debate disappears. Belts that are of appropriate public amenity would be listed for all time. The rest could be released. But without such listing, any weakening of the present protection must be resisted. It is as simple as that.

When it comes to the global food crisis, it isn’t so simpleGeorge MonbiotThe solution is not more fields but better, more compact, cruelty-free and pollution-free factoriesFri 26 May 2023 07.00 BSTLast modified on Fri 26 May 2023 11.00 BSTNo issue is more important, and none so shrouded in myth and wishful thinking. The way we feed ourselves is the key determinant of whether we survive this century, as no other sector is as damaging . Yet we can scarcely begin to discuss it objectively, thanks to the power of comforting illusions.Food has the extraordinary property of turning even the most progressive people into reactionaries. People who might accept any number of social and political changes can respond with fury if you propose our diets should shift. Stranger still, there’s a gulf between ultraconservative beliefs about how we should eat and the behaviour of people who hold such beliefs. I have heard people cite a rule formulated by the food writer Michael Pollan – “Don’t eat anything your great-great-great-grandmother wouldn’t recognise as food” – while eating a diet (Thai one day, Mexican the next, Mediterranean the day after) whose range of ingredients no one’s great-great-great-grandmother would recognise, and living much the better for it.Something is blocking us, a deep repression that stands in the way of honest conversation. It pushes food writers, celebrity chefs and some environmentalists to propose answers to the planetary crisis that are even more damaging than the problems they claim to address. Their solutions, such as pasture-fed meat, with its massive land demand , are impossible to scale without destroying remaining wild ecosystems: there is simply not enough planet. What is this inhibition and how does it arise?It’s now a year since I published Regenesis, a book that has incited levels of fury shocking even to me. I’ve spent much of this time trying to work out what makes people so angry. I think it’s because the book challenges what the cognitive historian Jeremy Lent calls a “root metaphor”: an idea so deeply embedded in our minds that it affects our preferences without our conscious knowledge.The root metaphor in this case is exemplified by King Charles III’s love affair with Transylvania, explored recently in the New Statesman. What he found there “was a perfectly bottled model of life before modernity”. “It’s the timelessness which is so important,” the king is reported to have said. “The landscape is almost out of some of those stories you used to read as a child.”Farming in Transylvania looks (or did until recently) just as it “ought” to look: tiny villages where cows with their calves, ducks with their ducklings and cats with their kittens share the dirt road with ruddy-cheeked farmers driving horses and carts; alpine pastures where sheep graze and people scythe the grass and build conical haystacks. In other words, as the king remarked, it looks like a children’s book.Making hay for animal feed in Zalánpatak, Transylvania, Romania. Photograph: JasonBerlin/AlamyA remarkable number of books for pre-literate children are about livestock farms. The farms they imagine look nothing like the industries that produce the meat, dairy and eggs we eat, which are generally places of horror. The stories they tell are a version of an ancient idyll of herders with their animals, built across thousands of years in pastoral poetry and religious traditions. Livestock farming in this idyll is a place of safety, harmony and comfort, into which we subconsciously burrow at times of unease.Much of the discussion of food and farming in public life looks like an effort to recreate that happy place. As a result, many of the proposed solutions to the global food crisis seek, in effect, to revive medieval production systems – to feed a 21st-century population. It cannot end well.For instance, there’s now a foodie obsession with hyper-free range chicken farming. Chickens, the new romantics propose, should follow grazing cattle, eating the insects that feed on their dung. As in the children’s books, farm animals of different species interact. But the chicken is a non-native, omnivorous bird of the pheasant family. Just as we begin to recognise the damage caused by the release of pheasants into the countryside – they work through baby snakes, frogs, caterpillars, spiders, seedlings – the nostalgists seek to do the same with chickens. To the extent that chickens feed themselves in such systems, they mop up wildlife. In reality, they can’t survive this way, so they continue to be fed on soy, often produced on former rainforest and Cerrado savanna in Brazil.This is what happens when people see the pictures and not the numbers. A scene that reminds us of our place of safety at the dawning of consciousness is used as the model for how we should be fed, regardless of whether it can scale. Bucolic romanticism might seem harmless. But it leads, if enacted, to hunger, ecological destruction or both, on a vast scale. Our arcadian fantasies devour the planet.Embrace what may be the most important green technology ever. It could save us all | George MonbiotRead moreStorybook farming never worked as the romantics claim. Widespread meat-eating in the 19th century became possible only through the colonisation and clearance of Australia and the Americas and the creation, largely by the British empire, of a global system sucking meat into rich nations. The cattle and sheep ranching that supplied our supposedly traditional diet drove the dispossession of Indigenous people and destruction of ecosystems on a massive scale, a process that continues to this day. When you challenge the story that masks these grim realities, it’s perceived as an attack on our very identity.Real solutions to our global food crises are neither beautiful nor comforting. They inevitably involve factories, and we all hate factories, don’t we? In reality, almost everything we eat has passed through at least one factory (probably several) on its way to our plates. We are in deep denial about this, which is why, in the US, where 95% of the population eats meat, a survey found that 47% wanted to ban slaughterhouses.The answer is not more fields, which means destroying even more wild ecosystems. It is partly better, more compact, cruelty-free and pollution-free factories. Among the best options, horror of horrors, is a shift from farming multicellular organisms (plants and animals) to farming unicellular creatures (microbes), which allows us to do far more with far less.King Charles would doubtless hate this. But there are 8 billion people to feed and a planet to restore, and neither can be achieved with retentive fantasies. I’ve found myself contesting a cruel, polluting and self-destructive mainstream farming model on one hand and, on the other, an idyllic reverie that would lead us to the twin disaster of agricultural sprawl and world hunger. It’s hard to decide which is worse.

Especially in a democracy as old and bodged-about as Britain, with its centuries of alterations to the electorate and yet its tendency to see each new set of arrangements as somehow natural, eternal and wise.Beneath the self-congratulation and claims of political neutrality, however, the shape of the electorate is always the product of power struggles, which are no less intense for often being hidden from sight. How adult, or how British, you need to be to have a say in how the country is governed: these are contested issues in an ever more fluid world.They are made more contentious still by political parties. For self-interested and philosophical reasons, Labour and the Tories have long had different ideas about who should be included in the electorate and who should be left out. For more than half a century, governments of both parties have redrawn its boundaries, sometimes to their considerable advantage.Keir Starmer’s recent suggestion that 16- and 17-year-olds should be given the vote in England and Northern Ireland (they already have it in Scotland and Wales for local and devolved elections) and that EU citizens living in the UK be allowed to vote in general elections (rather than only in local ones), provoked a tellingly furious response from the Conservatives and their press allies. Labour was accused of seeking to “rig the voting system”, and of “a plot to reverse Brexit”.Labour considers plans to let EU nationals and 16-year-olds voteRead moreIn some ways, the outrage was unjustified. Reversing Brexit is not likely to be Labour policy any time soon, and accusing the party of trying to rig elections seems rich coming from a government that has just introduced a voter ID law for precisely that reason, as the increasingly loose-tongued former minister Jacob Rees-Mogg admitted last week. Faced with multiplying enemies, the Tories’ unsubtle plan seems to be to give their narrow support more weight by making it harder for others to vote.Yet Starmer’s Tory critics were right about the potential importance of his proposals. His plan would add about 6.5 million people to the electorate, increasing it by 14%. And most of those new voters would probably not be Tories, given that Labour beat the Conservatives by 43 percentage points among 18- to 24-year-olds at the last election; and given how badly the government has treated Britain’s EU residents since Brexit. If Labour takes power and expands the electorate, comfortable Tory general election victories could become extremely rare. Even under the current system, they have had only one since 1987.Contemplating such large-scale shifts feels unfamiliar, even like a form of wishful thinking, because since at least the 90s, so much of our politics has been about the opposite: the targeting of small numbers of swing voters. Our first past the post system, the emphasis on marginal seats, and the ever greater precision of political research and marketing, all mean that winning elections is about gaining lots of small advantages – or so we are told by an industry of strategists, pollsters and focus group analysts.Yet Britain also has a largely forgotten history of less reactive, more ambitious approaches to the electorate. It arguably began in 1969, when the Labour government of Harold Wilson – in whose strong election-winning record Starmer takes a keen interest – reduced the voting age from 21 to 18. Cabinet supporters of the change argued that older teenagers were effectively adults; and also that giving them the vote “will channel their political energies into regular forms of political activity and away from the kind of violent demonstration in which students have recently been indulging” – the famous 1968 uprisings. Today’s 16- and 17 year-olds are not rioting yet, despite having almost their entire lives blighted by Tory austerity; but giving them the vote might make that less likely.Labour almost certainly gained from lowering the voting age. They won two of the next three elections. In October 1974, the first contest for which age-related voting data is available, almost twice as many 18- to 24-year-olds chose them as the Tories: a crucial factor in a narrow victory. Yet after the Conservatives returned to office in 1979, they initiated their own politically advantageous expansion of the electorate: giving expats the vote for the first time.Treating people living abroad as legitimate participants in domestic politics suggested that the Tories were not yet ready to give up on the old imperial idea that Britain was a global nation. It also reflected a common assumption that expats were rightwing: people who had left the country to make more money, pay lower taxes and escape postwar Britain’s supposedly stifling egalitarianism. Letting them register as “overseas voters” in the British constituencies where they had last lived was attacked by Labour as “international gerrymandering”. But the Tories ignored the accusation, and then extended how long expats could retain a vote in Britain from five to 20 years. At the 1992 election, the first after this change, it was estimated that about two-thirds of them backed the Conservatives.Nowadays, thanks largely to Brexit, expats are less likely to be Tories. Yet the questionable nature of letting people have a say over how Britain is governed without feeling some or any of the consequences remains. And so does the Conservative desire to harvest expat votes. Last year, the same Elections Act that introduced ID requirements for British residents who want to choose the rulers and policies that directly affect them included a less-noticed provision for expats to remotely enjoy “votes for life” in Britain. The government estimates that 3.5 million people could join the electorate. The legislation is expected to take effect in time for the next election.If Labour wins anyway, it is not guaranteed that the party will also widen the electorate. Since making his controversial suggestion about doing so Starmer has, typically, hedged his bets, saying that Labour has “no settled policy”.In Scotland and Wales, left-leaning parties have done well in elections since 16- and 17-year-olds were given the vote. The policy is supported by the SNP, the Lib Dems, the Greens and Plaid Cymru. Teenagers may not always make the most mature voters, but as the support from much older Britons for Brexit and a succession of poor Tory prime ministers has shown, advancing age and political wisdom don’t necessarily go together. It’s time for Labour to make Britain a younger democracy again.

Luckily, we can learn from our European neighboursFri 26 May 2023 08.45 BSTLast modified on Fri 26 May 2023 15.03 BSTLike all children, I hated rainy days. What I didn’t realise until I had my own baby was how my parents probably hated them, too. Cooped up, whingeing babies can make cooped up, whingeing babies of their adult caregivers, too. “Get outside every day,” people tell you, but you find yourself and the child all wrapped up and ready to go and standing in a doorway watching the showers come down in biblical sheets. A 2016 study that found that British children spend less time outdoors than prison inmates started to make a little bit more sense.I have sung a lot of Singin’ in the Rain this past winter, and then spring, but sometimes I’ve been crying on the inside. I don’t get seasonal affective disorder, but by April my spirits were starting to feel low. The weather feels personal now, in a way that it never did before, when I could hunker down with a book or a film or a glass of red wine and a record. Now stormy weather means trying to find endless entertainment for a baby who loves nothing more than being outside and watching the wind shake the leaves. It couldn’t have been more different than the spring we brought him into the world: our postpartum euphoria as we walked him through sunlit streets, long lunches of seafood pasta while he slept in the pram, pink blossom falling like snowflakes on the day we registered his birth. This year, it’s been so wet that he’s only just touched grass.It got me thinking about how weather and climate radically alter our experience of parenting and the culture of parenthood, depending on where on the planet we find ourselves. Before we had the baby, we used to go to Greece, and in my 20s I spent a year living in Italy. In both cases, I was always struck by the Mediterranean attitude to parenting, the children out playing far past British bedtime, as their parents dined and socialised nearby. I always felt that I wanted to be like that – not least because a later bedtime surely means a more civilised wake-up time – but, as well as the weather, it’s a challenge in a country that does not treat public space in the same way. The piazza shapes parenting, as it shapes many aspects of Italian life.The Arctic survival parenting of Sami reindeer herders is another example of how climate shapes family life. Children are taught independence from a young age as a way of building resilience in a hostile climate – children choose when they eat and when they sleep, curling up for a nap wherever they feel like it. “Me and the children can nap on an all-terrain vehicle, snowmobile, under a rain cover in a trailer or in our van”, a woman who married into a Sami family told the BBC. Families don’t follow a schedule; the terms are set by the natural environment.‘I took the baby out only in the early mornings and late evenings, though it hit 28C by 7am.’ Children play in a London fountain, 17 June 2022. Photograph: Kirsty Wigglesworth/APNow that things have brightened up, I have vowed to work towards helping my boy to learn to nap outside on a rug. Yesterday, in the playground, I met a Portuguese nanny who had put her charge face down on a blanket on the large circular nest swing and covered her with a coat. When I asked the woman how she had managed to get her to sleep so soundly, her response indicated that a child refusing to nap was not really an option. They sleep better outside, she said.‘One and done’ parents are some of the most thoughtful and compassionate I have met | Rhiannon Lucy CosslettRead moreScandinavians are inclined to agree. They’re famous for leaving sleeping babies in prams in the street, and will bundle them up and allow them to nap outside even in sub-zero temperatures. Nursery schools will put the children down in the garden, the theory being that the children are less likely to catch viruses than if you have them all sharing the same room. One piece of Finnish research found that babies slept longer outdoors than indoors.Perhaps my countryside roots are manifesting in my resistance to being an urban, “indoor” parent, or perhaps being outside just feels more natural to me. In an evolutionary sense, we are supposed to be outdoors, and, just as how babies relax during movement speaks to our nomadic past, there must be an atavistic desire to spend time in the open air.In the climate emergency, however, outdoor parenting is going to become more challenging than ever as weather becomes more extreme. The heatwave last summer, when I took the baby out only in the early mornings and late evenings, though it hit 28C by 7am, gave me a glimpse of things to come. Will the next few decades see London become unlivable for the very young and the very old? Our architecture is not built for heat as it is in warmer countries, and I’ll never forget the hellish week we spent breastfeeding under a fan, stuck together by a film of sweat. Periodically I would sponge down both the baby and Mackerel, our poor, panting cat, with flannels cooled in the fridge. We even considered putting him on Mackerel’s special pet cooling mat.Society will need to adapt, or British children will end up more cooped up than ever. I am immensely privileged to live in a place where the local government has prioritised shaded playgrounds, paddling pools and sprinkler areas, so that all children, regardless of whether they have access to a garden, can enjoy the summer. I can’t wait to introduce him to the joy of water play, but perhaps it’s time to think about a life that looks beyond the paddling pool to a closer engagement with nature. In the meantime, let’s just hope the weather holds up.What’s workingCheese as a vehicle for getting green veg into the baby. Like his mother, who is frequently mocked by his father for always adding it to dishes “for flavour”, the baby is a fromage fiend, and will eat almost anything as long as it factors. A friend uses a similar strategy, but with desiccated coconut. Yes, on everything, including bolognese.What’s notThis kid loves wiping his mouth on everything that isn’t a cloth. Feeding him has turned into a race against time: can you wipe his grubby chops before he launches himself at your lovely blouse or the nearest piece of furniture? The answer is almost always no, which is why the ottoman is covered in little rings of yoghurt.

Photograph: Apple TVOpinionDinosaursDavid Attenborough’s new series at last shows dinosaurs in all their feathered gloryDavid HoneThe prehistoric age has been stuck in a cultural rut since Jurassic Park. As a palaeontologist, I’m glad to see this era is overFri 26 May 2023 12.08 BSTLast modified on Fri 26 May 2023 13.20 BSTThe utterly extraordinary Prehistoric Planet has returned this week for a second season and, as a palaeontologist, I remain utterly enthralled by the whole thing. You might think I’d be spoiled for choice with the apparently unending parade of movies, video games and documentaries featuring animated dinosaurs, but this programme stands head and shoulders above anything else in terms of the accuracy of its animals and the naturalism they evoke.The jump from Ray Harryhausen classics such as One Million Years BC in the mid-1960s to Jurassic Park in 1993 was massive. Jurassic Park showed dinosaurs in a new way to vast audiences and ushered in a new wave of interest and representation, most notably in the BBC’s Walking with Dinosaurs series in 1999. However, 30 years on, most dinosaurs in mainstream film and TV still follow its look and feel, despite our scientific understanding of dinosaurs and their contemporaries having advanced enormously since then. Prehistoric Planet is as much, if not more, of a leap forward in showing dinosaurs as we think they really were.The most obvious progression is the number of dinosaurs being correctly shown with feathers and other filamentous coverings. Since the late 1990s, the fact that birds evolved from dinosaurs has become firmly established in palaeontology. Numerous fossils of fully feathered dinosaurs have been discovered, implying that many more bore feathers too. Seeing these animals rendered as they should be is very exciting. The details of the models, from the shape of the pupils, the size of the scales, the design of the colours, patterns and the curve of the claws, all speak to a depth of biological understanding not seen on screen before.Of course, some details are contentious and others unknowable, but the appearance and, more importantly, actions of the dinosaurs in these series are about as accurate as they could be. Where certain ideas are inevitably somewhat speculative, they are based on our current understanding. For example, in series one we see a herd of triceratops walking into caves to access some rare minerals needed in their diet. This is not something recorded in the fossil record, but we know that some modern animals – including elephants – do it, so it’s perfectly reasonable and likely that some dinosaurs did the same.For me, the key thing is not that these ancient animals are reproduced 100% accurately, but that they are brought to life realistically. Showing dinosaur mating rituals, parents nurturing their offspring and small animals challenging predators a dozen times their size is new, or very rare – and yet these are behaviours that are completely normal for animals. On top of this, it’s easy to spot various references to real scientific papers on the behaviour, appearance, actions and ecology of dinosaurs and other animals in every episode. There might necessarily be some extrapolation and filling in to account for the gaps in the fossil record, but this compelling television is clearly based on real research.And Prehistoric Planet doesn’t just show the inevitable gory scenes, such as a fight to the death between a tyrannosaurus and triceratops; it also gives the animals (and viewers) a chance to breathe and take in the view, whether it’s a swamp, desert or ice field (not just another procession of jungles). Dinosaurs, pterosaurs, plesiosaurs and other ancient animals are not monsters or mythical creatures, but were real (if very odd by today’s standards) living, breathing and behaving creatures interacting in thriving ecosystems.And so it is welcome to see other animals getting their due alongside these great reptiles. The inclusion of frogs, snakes, birds, mammals and ammonites, all set into coherent and realistic environments, makes the programme stand out even more. Although tyrannosaurus, velociraptor and some other household names appear, it’s extremely refreshing to see animals that few people have heard of, from alcione to zalmoxes, as well as numerous animals and landscapes that have never been shown before.We’re finding out more about dinosaurs than ever – but their sex lives still elude us | Dave HoneRead moreScience usually moves on incrementally, and occasionally in major jumps, but public perceptions tend to lag behind. It takes time for new ideas to become mainstream and then to appear on screen. Prehistoric Planet’s real achievement is not just bringing these animals to life, but doing so at the cutting edge of scientific discovery. It shows the public what palaeontologists believe these animals were really like, not just a slightly polished version of what scriptwriters imagine they were.As someone who is actively engaged in research into the biology of dinosaurs and pterosaurs, and in outreach and communication to the public about these animals, I find Prehistoric Planet to be a shining example of bringing them to life. The new series should be appreciated not just for its beautiful cinematography and Attenborough’s narration, but as a bleeding-edge representation of the science of the extinct.

Photograph: Jessica Taylor/UK Parliament/AFP/Getty ImagesOpinionImmigration and asylumThe Tories should be proud of Britain’s migration numbers – and they have Boris Johnson to thankGaby HinsliffThe party would rather brand itself a failure than accept that immigration has helped growth, and voters are relaxed about itThu 25 May 2023 18.43 BSTLast modified on Thu 25 May 2023 18.57 BSTIt feels like a lifetime ago that a Rochdale pensioner buttonholed Gordon Brown over what she called eastern Europeans “flocking” to Britain. Even then Gillian Duffy might not have made the headlines, except that later Brown was caught on mic calling her a “bigoted woman”, thus putting a memorable name and face to the endless debate about whether it’s racist to worry about immigration.At the time, annual net movement to Britain was about 252,000, and Labour was starting to worry about a backlash. By the time David Cameron – who took office promising to reduce it to the “tens of thousands” – called his Brexit referendum in 2016, net annual migration was 335,000 , and Vote Leave was vowing to take back control of Britain’s borders (though carefully it never specified what “control” meant). It had fallen back almost to Brown-era levels when Boris Johnson succeeded Theresa May, and while he went into an election casually promising that overall numbers would fall, May’s former chief of staff, Nick Timothy, disclosed this week that ministers were told not to repeat that pledge since their laid-back new leader didn’t actually believe in it.Sure enough, annual immigration had hit 504,000 by the time Rishi Sunak took office, and this week the Office for National Statistics reported a rise to 606,000 (though that may partly reflect a change this year in the way it compiles the figures). The really interesting twist in the tale? All those numbers bear surprisingly little resemblance to what people actually think.Back in the febrile Brexit summer of 2016, 70% of Britons told the pollster YouGov that immigration was too high. By last December, only 57% agreed, even though immigration itself had clearly shot up. “Too high” isn’t really a number but a feeling: a mood almost certainly influenced by lurid headlines about dinghies crossing the Channel – whose poor occupants have somehow become the public face of anxiety about immigration, although until this week they weren’t even included in the annual figures – or things heard down the pub, but perhaps also by a sense of whether the government is generally on top of things or mired in chaos. Which brings us, inevitably, to Boris Johnson.For all the hard rhetoric of his government, not to mention the crowd-pleasing casual racism that occasionally littered his newspaper columns, it was Johnson who ended up offering sanctuary to anywhere up to 3 million citizens of Hong Kong fleeing a Chinese crackdown, plus hundreds of thousands of refugees from Ukraine and as many Afghans working with British forces as could be rescued before Kabul fell to the Taliban. (Such humanitarian schemes accounted for more than a quarter of net immigration in 2022.)It was Johnson’s government, too, that actively recruited foreign master’s students by promising they could stay and work for up to three years after graduating, a ploy to attract bright minds to Britain (and use their tuition fees to bolster higher education funding). If immigration feels “too high” to Tory voters – those most obviously driving that sentiment now – it’s largely the result of Tory governments actively pursuing policies that pushed it up despite promising to do the opposite, as Labour MPs have been quick to point out.What few politicians are willing to say, however, is that – at least in a parallel universe where politicians were actually honest about what they were doing and why, instead of making promises they can’t deliver and then running away – those figures would more accurately be deemed a success than a failure.Why isn’t it a matter for national pride, not embarrassment, that British universities are still such an extraordinary draw for the brightest minds in the world? Why can’t we just be open about the fact that growth would almost certainly have been even lower, taxes even higher and the NHS even more broken than it is today had Johnson stuck to that empty promise? But instead of making the argument for policies agreed when he himself was chancellor, Rishi Sunak now boasts of making study visas less attractive by ending the right to bring dependents.Meanwhile, Suella Braverman claims – without offering any evidence – that master’s students’ families have been putting “untenable pressure on public services”. How terribly convenient, to have something other than a shortage of GPs to blame for the shortage of GP appointments. But the truth is, you’re probably more likely to be treated by a migrant worker than queue behind one, given four of the top five occupations granted skilled worker visas last year involved health or social care.Why the panic over rising immigration? The post-Brexit system is working | Jonathan PortesRead moreAny debate about whether immigration is too high, too low or just right ought to start by asking: right for what, exactly? Right for economic growth, social cohesion, the general human good, or for sustainable public services in a rapidly ageing country with an alarmingly shrunken tax base? (To the Canadian government, now actively aiming to attract half a million migrants a year to protect its economy from the consequences of a low birthrate and shrinking tax base, our numbers must look like a dream.) But in Britain, it seems to start with nervously trying to second-guess a public that is itself now confused.According to YouGov, a majority do still want immigration to come down but even bigger majorities simultaneously say they’re happy with the current number or more of skilled migrants, students and refugees fleeing war and persecution. That leaves low-skilled migrants, mostly doing the jobs that Britons don’t want to do themselves, as the obvious target. However, the fruit pickers and poultry packers hired as cheap temporary labour aren’t even included in this week’s ONS stats, but without them we would probably have even higher food prices and empty supermarket shelves. Try that, and see how fast the voters (and newspaper editors) who clamoured for this turn on you.A cynic might argue that in saying immigration must fall, both Sunak and Keir Starmer are merely playing for time: they can see they’re likely to get their wish without inflicting this kind of self-harm. This week’s headline number looks dramatic but is actually lower than predicted, with the ONS noting signs of immigration slowing towards the end of the year – unsurprisingly, given the British economy was doing the same.An end to the war in Ukraine, allowing refugees to go home, would also bring numbers down dramatically. The peak, in short, may already have passed and the long-term trend is towards voters being more relaxed about immigration. It’s just that on the evidence of the past few jittery days, it may take politicians a depressingly long time to catch up.

The HBO drama surrounding the Murdoch-esque family the Roys, fighting among themselves over who will become CEO of their media empire, has become a weekly lightning rod for debate in its final season (which ends on Monday). It’s normal to wake up on a Monday to a viral Twitter thread, Reddit or TikTok post putting forward a case for the morality of one of Succession’s main characters.The problem with these competing theories should be obvious to anyone who’s watched the show: every character on Succession is an irredeemably bad person.Succession isn’t bad – but it is overrated | Arwa MahdawiRead moreBe it Logan, the cruel and uncaring patriarch; any of his kids, each greedy, self-involved and violent in their own special way; or even the cast of secondary characters, all desperate sycophants operating entirely based on what will get them closer to power – the show is a conveyor belt of the worst human impulses. But it’s not just Succession: on TV today, highbrow dramas are filled with casts of unlikable characters. From Industry to The White Lotus, “prestige television” has become synonymous with knowing the people you’re watching are, on the whole, mostly bad.You can see why this is happening now. Shows full of these detestable characters – and in particular Succession – have come as a welcome relief for viewers who spent much of the last decade being preached to by soapy dramas with clear moral centres and/or obvious antiheroes (think: Orange Is the New Black, House of Cards, Master of None). The carefully drawn depravity baked into each of the Roys feels like an honest version of reality, without opportunistic sensationalism.While this trend has accelerated, a crevasse has opened up between the two types of most popular TV, with these prestige dramas where no one is a good person sitting at one end while the other is occupied by “nicecore” shows – like Ted Lasso or Abbott Elementary – where everyone is. The latter is full of peppy, saccharine characters who spend their time overcoming easy obstacles that teach viewers lessons about love and friendship they already know. These shows’ plotlines aren’t only unchallenging – with happy endings expected and baked in – they increasingly act as mini-moral infomercials, where characters give seemingly random monologues about consent, bullying and the importance of “feeling your feelings”.Jason Sudeikis in Ted Lasso, a ‘nicecore show’ Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamyFlawed good people are much harder to capture than near-perfect ones or shallow supervillains (it’s also easier said than done to create a balanced portrayal of good and bad without cloying sweetness or cliche). This isn’t to say there should be some plucky hero trying to stick up for the little guy on Succession, or two people in a perfectly well-adjusted relationship on The White Lotus – that would ruin these thoughtfully curated ensembles. But within the current landscape there’s little of this mixed morality on screen being done well. Audiences are often left choosing between the worst of humanity or a syrupy overdose of the best of it.What links The White Lotus to Tom Wolfe and the Sicilian good life?Read moreBut the new wave of apparently morality-free dramas do offer something that the alternative – shows about horrible people that ask you to simply judge them – would not. The increasingly saturated genre of shows and films “skewering” the rich adopted an instructive overtone where wealthy people are hammily portrayed as one-dimensional cartoon villains, such as in the now-canned Gossip Girl reboot or the recent Netflix film, Glass Onion, resulting in flat, predictable dramas. Viewers even appeared to prefer the second season of The White Lotus to the first after it dropped this tone from its writing, giving its characters greater moral complexity and less moralising (which yielded a far more interesting story).And perhaps this is partly why, even with the objective ugliness that defines each of the Roys and their nauseating counterparts, there is a pervasive belief among much of Succession’s audience that there still must be someone on the show for them to root for. Checking social media after each episode has become a game of seeing how far tens of thousands of viewers will go to argue that an abominable character – whether it’s a Nazi sympathiser, a narcissist, a killer, or some combination of all three – is merely flawed. This impulse is so insurmountable that many people who can clearly see the bad still find themselves grappling around these casts trying to sniff out a shred of good.Even if itself a flawed instinct, the persistence of this impulse is a large part of what makes Succession so successful. Its greatest trick is getting us to feel empathy for its characters in spite of their evident evil – characters who would happily ruin our lives in exchange for an inch of influence. It’s why, as the series ends, many viewers are already “pre-grieving” this show that managed to make a group of such bad people watchable – for some, even beloved. In its wake, we should expect to see casts like these more often, but we shouldn’t hold our breath for something that replicates its delicate, depraved balance.

Now the right doesn’t want any migrants at allAditya ChakraborttyThis week’s furore over entirely legal migration proves it was never the kind of foreigner you were, simply your foreignnessThu 25 May 2023 06.00 BSTLast modified on Thu 25 May 2023 08.16 BSTFew sights are as sad as someone who gets exactly what they want and hates it, yet that is exactly how the British right behaves.Hacking back the state? They swung the axe for a decade, only to complain about the damage done. Boris Johnson? Once their surefire winner, he has made them all losers. And, of course, there’s Brexit – the summit towards which so many trudged, only to find the view from the top a dud. Every last one of the right’s grievances has been dealt with, and it drives them mad.The best illustration of this paradox is the item forever at the top of the rage list: immigration. For days, the usual blimpish faces in Westminster and across the press have been mottling with fury at the prospect of official figures showing a record high in the net total of people coming to this country – through the proper channels, with the correct forms and often having paid thousands of pounds in fees. This is legal migration – the kind that, just a few weeks ago, Tory backbenchers, GB News presenters and Telegraph columnists claimed to welcome. It was the people coming over in small boats who had to be stopped. “Illegal migration is not fair on British taxpayers, it is not fair on those who come here legally,” said Rishi Sunak in March. But this week, he said that legal migration was creating “unmanageable pressure”. So now we know: the sticking point is no longer what kind of foreigner you are – it’s simply your foreignness.“A population crisis,” Nigel Farage calls it. An “addiction to immigration,” says Theresa May’s former righthand man Nick Timothy. Yet the immigration system they and the rest of the right decry is the very one they installed.During the EU referendum, Vote Leave’s trump card was the need to shut Britain’s “open borders”. One of Brexit’s virtues, Iain Duncan Smith told the BBC, was that it would stop “very low-value, low-skilled people coming through”. Careless words, especially from an MP judged by his own colleagues to be so low-value and low-skilled they booted him from the Tory leadership. Nevertheless, this was the reason why IDS, Farage and Johnson demanded an “Australian-style” points system, which focus group experts such as James Frayne found was “probably the most popular policy ever tested”.And lo! The UK now has total control over its borders and those Aussie rules ensure we get some of the highest-value, highest-skilled people the world has to offer. The right won big – so, of course, it acts like a sore loser. Duncan Smith now pleads with his government to “get a grip” on immigration.But the government has indeed got a grip. The UK defines exactly which foreigners cross its borders. It invites in Ukrainians and Hongkongers while refusing entry to many of those fleeing Afghanistan and Sudan. The government wants foreign students to come, because the billions they spend here help prop up a broken higher education system and lift depressed local economies. No 10, the Treasury and most of Whitehall – apart, perhaps, from Speedy Suella Braverman and her team – know that the students will go once their courses are finished and that the number of Ukrainian refugees to Britain has probably peaked. The government could most likely do nothing and the next migration figures would show a big drop.But the right needs scapegoats. The men with greased hair and a plausible manner who occupy newspaper columns and squat on TV studio sofas blame migrants for Britain’s housing crisis, for taking jobs from British workers and for failing to integrate. It is at points like this, when the language around immigration gets especially Enoch, that I realise afresh just how many of the public debates on this issue feature neither migrants nor children of migrants. The media, the right often complains, is “too London”. If that were really true, then 37% of media workers would be migrants, since that is how much they make up of the capital’s population. Yet you and I both know that will never happen.Instead, we get dehumanising language used by both major parties and the press. Immigration is a game of “whac-a-mole”, Westminster sources tell the Sunday Times – as if those born abroad should be hit with a hammer. This week, Labour’s Keir Starmer complained of “uncontrolled immigration”. No doubt he hopes to convey an idea of a government in chaos. But the most direct victims of such language are not the Tory frontbench. New research this week from Hope Not Hate reports a direct link between politicians’ use of inflammatory language around immigration and activity by the far right. Braverman hatches a Rwanda plan and the far right share the Mail’s front pages. Robert Jenrick bemoans “Hotel Britain” and the boys in bovver boots lap it up. This all amid a rise in far-right protests outside hotels housing asylum seekers. The violence of such language has a consequence – and it tends to be felt by a mum in a headscarf taking her kids home on the bus, or a grandad making his way out of Friday afternoon prayers.The narrowness with which immigrants are discussed sits at such odds with the breadth of their experiences. For her recent book, The Migrants’ Paradox, LSE professor Suzanne Hall interviewed people from more than 500 migrant-run small businesses, from Bristol to Leicester to Manchester. In long, detailed surveys that took five years to collect, she found a richness and resilience that goes nearly unmentioned. On Rye Lane in Peckham, south London, 61% of migrant businesspeople spoke two or three languages; 28% spoke four or more. In Birmingham, she found a street of shops run by people from Cameroon to Kurdistan to Vietnam. These are communities working in deprived areas, often on the frontline of street racism and in the face of council incomprehension. Yet they plug on, despite “long working hours, falling wages and rising rents”. The reward for many is not prosperity but precariousness, not citizenship but what Hall calls “denizenship”. They are both the heart of the local high street and confined to the very periphery of national politics.You don’t hear them whining. Indeed, you may not hear them at all. They’ve been drowned out by the men who got everything on their shopping list and now have a bad case of buyer’s remorse.

Initially, his supporters talked up this month’s local elections as a moment of peril for Rishi Sunak, that could lead to a Johnson restoration by the autumn. Then it moved to next year’s local elections.Others now say the moment will come after the next general election. In the face of a Tory loss, Johnson could re-emerge as MPs conclude that ousting him was the moment it all went wrong. As ever with such wargaming, Johnson is keeping his distance, leaving it to his supporters to dream big.But the events of this week have left some in the party wondering if it will ever happen. In the Tory party, there is a rule never to write Johnson off – he has come back from many setbacks in the past. Yet the news that the Cabinet Office has referred Johnson to the police over possible Covid breaches regarding visits by family and friends to Chequers and Downing Street – documented in his own diary – has served to remind his party of the events that led to his demise. It’s also highlighted the limited support he now has in parliament.When Johnson considered a comeback in the autumn after Liz Truss imploded, one of the key blockers to gaining wider support from MPs was the privileges committee investigation hanging over him. If Johnson were to be found guilty of misleading parliament and face a suspension of 10 or more sitting days, he would be vulnerable to a byelection. Why bet on a leader who could lose his seat months later?The result of that Partygate investigation by the privileges committee is expected next month – and was meant to be when the former prime minister could draw a line under the whole saga for better or worse. Now Johnson risks yet another investigation if the police decide to pursue one. Even if it goes no further, the events point to how painful the coming Covid inquiry is likely to be for both Johnson and the Tory party more widely. “A lot of us reluctantly decided he had to go [in 2022] so the story would stop,” says one MP who backed Johnson for leader in 2019. “He’s gone, but it’s still going”.There was certainly a lot of noise from Johnson’s supporters when the latest story broke this week. While he is said to be considering legal action against the government, his supporters began to anonymously threaten to “obstruct” Sunak’s premiership unless he stepped in to bring an end to the “witch-hunt” (ministers deny any involvement). There are threats to force byelections in the near future. One former minister predicted a confidence vote on Sunak could follow as “54 letters [are] not hard between now and November”.‘Are you determined to turn our party into a skip fire?’ Jackie Doyle-Price and Boris Johnson on a visit to Tilbury Docks in January 2022. Photograph: ReutersThis led to a pile-on over Tory WhatsApp channels as Jackie Doyle-Price – who backed Liz Truss in the summer leadership contest – posed the question of the day: “FFS: who on earth is spouting this bonkersness? Are you determined to turn our party into a skip fire?” Only one MP – Andrea Jenkyns – attempted to mount a partial defence.But there has been little in the way of complaints to the whips on the issue. The mood in the mainstream of the party is that the story is an inconvenience, yet not one that raises questions of leadership. “He has some very loud supporters but they’re starting to look a bit cranky,” says one senior Tory. “They don’t reflect the mood in the party”.Most want to move on in the hope of avoiding a catastrophic electoral defeat next year. When it comes to the dismal local election results, the chaos surrounding the final days of Johnson’s premiership and Truss’s time in No 10 regularly came up on the doorstep as reasons not to vote Tory.What the Johnson story has done, however, is reignite concerns in the party that for some MPs, the appetite for a grudge match is larger than the appetite to win. After years of infighting and the poison that follows from ousting not one but two leaders, can the party really unite? “Yes, Tory MPs are addicted to psychodrama,” messaged one exasperated Tory MP when we posed the question this week on an episode of the Spectator Coffee House Shots podcast. A minister went further. “Look at Labour, they still have Corbynite MPs but you don’t hear much from them. They want to win. The question is whether we do.”It’s why some MPs believe Downing Street should either discipline the more rowdy MPs or make an effort to hug them close. “At the moment they are just acting like independents,” says one former minister. While there is little evidence that these MPs have the power to crash Sunak’s plans – the Windsor framework rebellion was contained and the row over retained EU law has calmed – they are able to make enough noise to fill the news agenda.Johnson’s resignation honours list is a perfect example of the problem he poses. The list – already being subjected to claims of cronyism – will only worsen the former PM’s standing with the parliamentary party. It will also bring negative headlines that risk damaging the Tory party. Johnson’s ongoing problems make his return less likely – but they also make Sunak’s task of turning things round ahead of the next election even harder.

Over the past five decades plastic products have found their way into almost every aspect of our daily lives. Global plastic production has reached a total of 8bn tonne – that’s 1 tonne for every person currently on the planet – with plastic pollution expected to triple by 2060.Current best estimates are that only about 10% of plastic ever produced has been recycled. Despite this, the idea of circular economy in the plastics industry is often cited as the magic bullet: we will simply reuse the plastic we have already made and reduce the impact of plastic pollution. But new evidence points to the flaws in this plan. A report by Greenpeace has found that recycled plastic can be even more toxic, and is no fix for pollution.Plastics cause wide-ranging health issues from cancer to birth defects, landmark study findsRead moreIt is now well known that plastic pollution is ubiquitous across the planet, with evidence of plastic particles being found in the deepest parts of the ocean, from the Mariana Trench to the peak of Mount Everest. There is justified concern about the impact of this pollution, both on ecosystems and human health. However, as an environmental chemist who has been studying plastic in the environment, I am increasingly concerned by a more hidden “invisible” threat posed by plastics: toxic chemicals.It is estimated that more than 13,000 different chemicals are involved in the production of plastics, and many of these have never been assessed for their toxicity. Chemicals are used alongside the plastic polymer itself to create the desired physical properties for different applications: how bendy or rigid you want your plastic, whether it needs to be fire-resistant or resilient to the effects of sunlight, not forgetting dyes and pigments used to give the product the desired colour.In food packaging or products designed for small children, there are stringent regulations of which chemicals can be included in order to reduce or mitigate the potential risk of exposure to toxins. However, this becomes problematic when you start to consider recycled plastics.Plastics collected for recycling will have been made for a variety of different uses (just think what might be in your household plastic recycling bin) and contain a wide range of chemicals used in their manufacture. If you add to the equation the fact that plastics very easily absorb substances that they come into contact with (containers for pesticides, household cleaning products etc), then you have the potential for a cocktail of chemicals, none of which will be removed by the recycling process.On top of this, studies have shown that other toxic chemicals can actually be produced during the physical process of recycling the material. As a result, these toxic chemicals can be transferred into products made from the recycled material, with evidence showing this includes food packaging and children’s toys.Many of the chemicals routinely found in plastics have endocrine-disrupting effects: they can interfere with the way our body’s hormones work. This can cause a range of health problems, including cancer risk and fertility problems. These chemicals also impact on our natural environment, for example affecting the reproductive health of river fish stocks. It would not be realistic to say that we should ban plastic production altogether (at least not in the short to medium term). Arguably, it makes sense to make some products from plastics where a lightweight, durable material is required. That said, substantially reducing our daily reliance on single-use plastics of course needs to be part of the solution.The most important thing is that we control the use of toxic chemicals needed to manufacture the plastics and the first step in doing this is knowing what is actually in the materials in the first place. This information is difficult to obtain because it is commercially sensitive, but I would argue that increased transparency in the industry is needed.I believe that recycling can also play an important role in solving the plastic crisis, but new regulation is needed to control the products that can be made out of recycled plastic where the impact of chemical risk is reduced, for instance putting it into construction materials or building foundations for new roads.The other key aspect to this problem is innovation – we need to design new ways of making these materials where both the polymers and the chemicals used are more sustainable and, most importantly, non-toxic. Where the use of toxic chemicals is unavoidable then there should be more stringent controls over the end-of-life processing, and they should only be used when absolutely necessary.The plastic problem is real and it is serious, but if scientists, industry, governments, and consumers all work together then we can overcome this crisis. We all have a crucial role to play.

To make the best of it, it helps to work with an accurate model of how the economy works. If you use a misleading model and act on it, you can’t reasonably expect good outcomes: in that scenario, we end up, as JM Keynes warned in the 1930s, with “madmen in authority”, acting according to the precepts of “some defunct economist”.But that’s exactly where we are. One of the most deeply held and frequently heard propositions about capitalism is that it revolves around private companies and individuals taking risks. When, earlier this year, the US government arranged a rescue package for Silicon Valley Bank, for instance, among the many objections to it was the claim that the rescue contravened capitalism’s risk norms.“The US is supposed to be a capitalist economy,” said the billionaire Ken Griffin, founder of the US investment firm Citadel, “and that’s breaking down before our eyes.” Capitalism, Griffin argued, is about taking risk. If returns are achievable without taking risk – the apparent message of the bailout – then, for Griffin at least, it is no longer capitalism.This view of the world directly informs wide swaths of economic policymaking today. When business confidence ebbs and investment declines, an increasingly common policy response is to “de-risk” business investment – usually by subsidising it or guaranteeing returns. The prime example in recent memory was the US’s Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, the kernel of which is a package of tax credits designed to make private investment in clean energy less risky.But examine the economy, and it becomes clear: capitalism has become less and less about corporate risk-taking in recent decades. To be sure, many businesses do take significant risks. The independent small business owner who opens a new cafe in London generally faces intense competition and massive risk. But as political scientist Jacob Hacker has argued, business in general has been enormously skilled in recent times at offloading risk – principally by dumping it on those least able to bear it: ordinary households.Paradoxically, the best example of a business usually regarded as being fundamentally about risk-taking but which in fact is not, is Ken Griffin’s own: alternative asset management, an umbrella term for hedge funds, private equity and the like. (“Alternative” here means anything other than publicly listed stocks and bonds.) Asset managers are anything but marginal, exotic firms – they manage more than $100tn of clients’ money globally and control everything from Center Parcs UK to your local Morrisons.But let’s look at what asset management companies in places like Britain and the US actually do. Three considerations are paramount.First, there is the matter of whose capital is put at risk when alternative asset managers such as Citadel, Blackstone and KKR invest. In large part, it’s not theirs. The proportion of equity invested by a typical hedge or private equity fund that is the asset manager’s own is usually between 1% and 3%. The rest is that of their external investor clients (the “limited partners”), which include pension schemes.Second, consider how an asset manager’s investments are designed. For one thing, its own financial participation in, and management of, its investment funds is usually through a vehicle (the “general partnership”) that is constituted as a separate entity, precisely in order to insulate the firm and its professionals from liability risk.Furthermore, the fund and its manager is generally distanced from underlying investments by a chain of intermediary holding companies that protect it from the risk inherent in those investments. In leveraged buyouts, where money is borrowed to help finance a deal, the debt goes on to the balance sheet of the company the fund has acquired. This means if trouble arises in repaying the debt, it is not the investment fund that is on the hook, still less its manager.The City of London. ‘Asset managers are anything but marginal, exotic firms – in Britain, they own everything from Center Parcs UK to your local Morrisons.’ Photograph: Henry Nicholls/ReutersThird and last, fee structures also distance asset managers from risk. If a fund underperforms, they may earn no performance fee (based on fund profits), but they do have the considerable consolation – a form of risk insurance, if you like – of the guaranteed management fee, usually representing about 2% of limited partners’ committed capital, year after year. Essentially, management fees pay asset managers’ base salaries; performance fees pay bonuses.In short, then, it would be far-fetched to suggest that what hedge funds and the like do amounts substantially to risk-taking. The only meaningful risk they themselves face is that of losing custom if fund returns prove underwhelming.In reality, the business of alternative asset management is less about taking on risk than, in Hacker’s terms, moving it elsewhere. So when things go wrong, others bear the brunt. This can be the employees on the shopfloor of a retailer owned by private equity who find that they’ve shouldered the risk when they’re told they’re being laid off. It can be ordinary retirement savers, who find they have a meagre pension because the alternative funds in which their savings were invested by the asset manager have tanked.Why does this matter? Because unless elected policymakers understand how risk is produced and distributed in modern economies, they will not be in a position to act appropriately and proportionately. That is why vague talk from politicians of being “pro-business” or “entrepreneurship” mean so little; the point is to learn from economic realities as they actually are, as opposed to how economics textbooks say they could or should be.Top 10 hedge funds made £1.5bn profit from Ukraine war food price spikeRead moreThere is one very obvious policy recommendation for alternative asset management that flows from our understanding what they actually do with “risk”: taxing them more.The main performance fee earned by alternative asset managers is “carried interest” – effectively, a profit share. In the UK and US, most asset management firms pay tax on this revenue at the capital gains rate, rather than the usually higher income tax rate. This is because the asset manager has typically been understood to be “taking on the entrepreneurial risk of the [investment]” – a standard justification for taxation as capital gain.But as we have seen, this simply does not hold water. In 2017, the New York Times called the beneficial tax treatment of carried interest “a tax loophole for the rich that just won’t die”. It’s time to close it. In fact, the recent confirmation by Keir Starmer’s Labour party that it would do exactly that if it wins power was one of the few genuinely progressive and sensible economic policy moves it has made while in opposition.

A broken bone, damaged tissue or a bleeding wound is often the focus, but the experience of pain is the sum total of more than just the physical injury – it is the result of information sent from our nerves being filtered through an individual’s unique psychological makeup, genetics, gender, beliefs, expectations, motivations and emotional context. Pain is therefore an individual experience, and often confounds and frightens us, as well as those we love and who love us.Acute pain is a life-preserving sensory and emotional experience, like hunger or thirst, and is produced by the brain to alert us to an actual or potential threat to our survival from damage to our bodies. It is a complex biological alarm system and, like all systems, may malfunction. When it becomes dysfunctional, the individual experiences pain without identifiable damage. The disease state that results is called chronic pain. At the moment, it cannot be cured – in other words, there is no bone that can be mended or wound that can be stitched that will cause the alarm to be switched off.For people who report chronic pain with nothing to show for it when examined or scanned, a biomarker, or scientific measurement that could objectively show the abnormality in their system has long been a goal of researchers. In a recent study by the University of California, San Francisco, Prasad Shirvalkar and colleagues studied four individuals who suffer from chronic pain.The team implanted electrodes into areas of the brain responsible for planning, expectation and emotion, which are important in the genesis of the experience of pain. They then correlated the brain activity in these areas using machine learning, with daily self-reported pain intensity scores from the four individuals over six months. The research enabled them to objectively demonstrate that the information-processing areas of the brain in chronic pain are distinct from that of acute pain.Rather than just relying on the individual’s report of pain as the evidence for their experience, abnormal neural activity correlated with their report provides objective evidence of the presence of chronic pain. In a sense, it allows researchers to visualise the condition, like one could a broken bone on an X-ray.Because chronic pain is not associated with ongoing tissue damage, often individuals who report pain where there is no evidence of injury are not believed. Consider, for example, someone who reports persistent pain following a whiplash injury but does not have any orthopaedic damage. This person may be accused of feigning the experience of pain for the sake of a compensation claim.The conditions that can lead to chronic pain are varied. The study looked at one person with chronic pain after amputation, which results in a condition called phantom limb pain. The brain struggles to cope with the loss of sensory input to the brain from the missing limb, and tries and fails to reorganise that part of the brain responsible for sensation in the missing limb, resulting in pain. Pain can also be caused in this condition due to nerves that have been cut as a result of the loss. Three other individuals studied had pain after brain damage from a stroke. The damaged nerves in the brain short-circuit, and pain is experienced in the body parts that the damaged nerves are responsible for controlling.Although chronic pain can arise from different causes, understanding the similar brain areas responsible for chronic pain may in the future yield treatments aimed at specifically addressing these dysfunctional regions. This could be by modulating the nervous system, through the application of electricity, to cause the release of chemicals that can inhibit the abnormal nervous system activity that causes the experience of persistent pain. Stimulation of the spinal cord with an electrical current is routinely used to treat nerve pain from diabetes and pain from injured spinal nerves caused by a prolapsed disc (sciatica). A similar approach could work in the brain.Alzheimer’s drugs are a ray of hope. They must be accessible to all, not the wealthy few | Devi SridharRead moreWe are in our infancy in terms of understanding how and why our nervous system changes to produce chronic pain that is ubiquitous and disabling. But we do know chronic pain often has pejorative connotations. People who have cancer are generally regarded as heroic for their perseverance through suffering. Raising awareness for cancer treatment and prevention is often much easier than promoting the plight of individuals who suffer with chronic pain.Individuals who report pain in the absence of visible damage are often not believed or the condition is dismissed. The universality of the acute-pain experience and the widespread understanding that pain must always be due to tissue damage also hampers research and support for people who suffer with chronic pain.Chronic pain often joins us on our journey in life, particularly as we age. Although Shirvalkar’s research is promising as a gateway to future pain therapies, and is yet another step towards recognising chronic pain as a disease in its own right, we do not as yet have reliable and effective treatments for managing it. So, ultimately, prevention is better than long-term opioid use or risky interventions. Attention to exercise, nutrition, sleep and psychological wellbeing are strategies available now to improve health overall and delay the onset of chronic pain from strokes.

Mon 22 May 2023 12.00 BSTLast modified on Mon 22 May 2023 12.29 BSTTwo weeks ago I started a new job, working with young people who are being exploited or at risk of being dragged into county-lines activities. The problem is becoming more prevalent in schools, colleges and pupil referral units (PRU) – children are doing it to other children now.I feel I can help in a positive way. And although I was hoping for a permanent job with holiday pay, this is an ongoing contract initially for three months. But the pay is better than my last job and I’m starting to plan for the future.I want to go on holiday. I haven’t had a holiday since before the pandemic. I had booked to go to Morocco, but it was cancelled during lockdown. Now my passport has expired and I will have to pay £82.50 to renew it; the fee went up in February. I plan to start putting money aside each week.My new job is full time but I don’t have to go into an office every day, so I save a bit of money on travel. I’ve still got my other jobs: my Saturday reparation work, my casual youth work, my evening youth work. It’s a lot, but it’s good because many people are doing that now – I’ve always had lots of jobs so it doesn’t feel like a chore to me, it feels normal. Still, I need a holiday. I need to get out of here.Have you seen the price of butter and everything that’s gone up? It’s crazy. I did some shopping the other day, I spent £100 because I’ve reduced my shop to every two weeks. I have to cook more often now, so I’m back doing that on a Saturday and Sunday.Food prices will soon overtake energy in driving UK inflation, report predictsRead moreIt seems to me that some shops have increased prices during this cost of living crisis out of greed. Inflation is supposed to be going down. The shopping should reflect that but prices keep going up. My rent has gone up as well. My council tax has gone up. My phone bill has gone up. Broadband has gone up. Everything has gone up.Everything about the UK feels so toxic at the minute. I feel as if I’m constantly on edge. With this racist rhetoric that is coming from the government, I can’t help but feel something bad is going to happen. I feel I could be targeted, with the government not condemning it, which is worrying. I don’t feel comfortable. Before, I used to think: “I’m British, I’m here.” Now, I’m not too sure.I’m thinking of comments like Robert Jenrick’s, when he said that “uncontrolled illegal migration” threatened to “cannibalise” the UK’s compassion. What has cannibalism got to do with migrants? Or Suella Braverman reportedly making her views “very plain” to Essex police after they removed golly dolls from a pub. Or the Windrush compensation scheme, which is taking too long.It’s a pressure cooker and it’s going to spill over. I don’t think the government understands the level of hate it has stirred up in its constant attacks on brown people. I am not alone in this. I talk to my colleagues. I talk to my friends. Everybody feels the same.A couple of weeks ago I was in Tesco and there was a guy standing next to me. I didn’t know if he was in the queue or not, so I asked him. He looked me in the face, and chose not to respond. These days, my only conclusion is that he didn’t want to answer me because of the colour of my skin. While I can’t be sure why I was totally ignored, what other reason could there have been?I’ve had to go back to basics in order for me to feel good about my life. I’ve had to say: “Sharron, you’ve got a flat, be grateful. Sharron, you’ve got a job, be grateful. Sharron, you’ve got up today and you’re going out and you’re walking and you can see, you can talk, you’re not ill.” I’ve had to go back and appreciate everything from the basics. There is no other way.

Mon 15 May 2023 13.00 BSTLast modified on Tue 16 May 2023 14.23 BSTWe take things day by day with my dad. After more than 10 years as his full-time carer, I know not to get my hopes up that things will magically get better. At the end of last year, he had some polyps removed from his colon. The surgery helped him to start eating again and gain some weight, something I had been hoping for. I bought him some clothes in bigger sizes for Christmas and now they fit him, which is so good to see. He has his appetite back and can stand long enough in the kitchen to make himself something to eat. Sometimes he’ll even go out for a little walk, which can make you feel as if he is making progress.But then I will arrive the next day and he can’t get out of bed. He tells me he can’t move. He rolls and groans but can’t say what’s wrong. He’s not an old man so there’s clearly something. He used to be so fit: he played football, he had a dog he’d walk for miles, he baked his own bread. Yesterday was one of those bad days so he has another GP appointment tomorrow. This is how we live now – one day at a time without planning or hoping, or looking too far into the future.February and March were particularly rough. With Christmas and New Year over, the days were dark, quiet and cold. Even now, he is still living in thermals and sleeping under extra duvets. He has no central heating in his flat. I’ve been trying to get him into new accommodation, somewhere warm and dry, where the ceiling isn’t caving in because of the damp. Somewhere safe; there’s always screaming and shouting where he lives and I’ve turned up to find police tape cordoning off his building.Finding something suitable has been a nightmare. I’m an educated person and even I am stumped by the endless bureaucracy. I will think I have put him on a waiting list but when I try to follow up – what are his options? How long will the wait be? – I just get an automated email or a leaflet in the post that doesn’t answer any of my questions. Every government website seems impossible to navigate and I think it’s deliberate. There’s usually no phone number, no email address. My laptop and phone are both really old models and there’s no way I can afford new devices or updates or technical help. I often wonder if my technology just isn’t compatible with the right systems. I can’t be the only one.In my freezing house, gripped by fear, I scrawl ‘things can get better’ on a chalkboard | MarinRead moreI do the shopping for us. The cost is easily two-and-a-half times what it was last year. The only reason I’m managing OK is because I’ve been getting vouchers from the food bank. I look after my dad in the daytime and I don’t go out much in the evening – it’s unaffordable – so I stay in, read, watch TV. I’m endlessly angry about our situation so I try not to engage too much with the news. Instead, I get my news from lefty comedians – that way it at least comes with a laugh. My dad has a dark sense of humour, too, and a wicked accent – old school, deep Midlands. No one young talks like that any more. Spending so much time together isn’t always easy, but we still manage to laugh.My hope for the summer is a new home for him in a ground-floor flat somewhere safe and comfortable, where he can start building his strength. He wants a dog when he’s able to walk one – he’s always had dogs in the past – and who knows, maybe it will be possible. If all that happens, we’ll be doing all right.

Wed 8 Mar 2023 12.00 GMTLast modified on Mon 13 Mar 2023 16.15 GMTI have a visitor that stops me sleeping, wakes me early in the morning and hangs around most days uninvited and unwanted: I am living with fear.Each day when I open my eyes, there’s a few seconds of semiconscious calm before my heart sets off to sprint in this race without end. Sometimes I try to calm myself down with deep breathing, but mostly I simply flee from my bed, the cold biting deep as I descend the stairs to make tea and talk myself down. Breakfast is impossible with adrenaline coursing through my body at max strength.I have a chalkboard in the kitchen where I used to write shopping reminders. Now I use it to self-medicate, with greetings card therapy written in my scrawly hand: “Things can get better” and “Nothing lasts for ever”. I repeat them out loud to try to will them to be true.I feel constantly vulnerable from the insecurity that has invaded my life: the rented roof over my head, precarious freelance work, the cost of living now I’m in my early 60s. I’m not the only one going through tough times, but when I close my front door, I am alone.I share about my predicament, up to a point. I recently house-sat for a friend, who left a note beside the central heating thermostat: “Don’t be cold.” The pure joy of hot radiators and oven-roasted vegetables was a great respite. But I tend not to talk about the darker stuff around losing work and having no safety net, because I am embarrassed and ashamed.Friends’ lives are neat and orderly. Mine is a cold mess. Seated at a friend’s dining table, in their warm house, I prefer to savour every minute rather than dredge up the fears that are following me. And the thought that perhaps I could end up homeless.I play a game of sliding doors in my head and wonder how it must feel to live their lives. How close I came to being them. Everyone has demons, I decide. We’re all human.Rich people help themselves, poor people help each other – I saw a food bank user take in a homeless friendRead moreWhen I was little, my mum took Valium from the doctor “to control her nerves”. Back then, mental illness was stigmatised. You were told to pull yourself together, to get on with it.When things improved, Mum still kept a single Valium in her purse, a red and green torpedo to neutralise whatever threatened to spiral out of control. It got gnarled and squashed, and eventually she threw it away. I assume that was the day she no longer felt afraid.I long for a time when fear is no longer my shadow.These days, I can access mental health support with the click of a computer mouse, but it is harder to solve the systemic inequality that pervades some of our lives: the NHS on its knees, social care in tatters, food banks barely keeping working families afloat.Talking therapies help to dampen anxiety, but what is there to do about the cold, hunger and poverty that perpetuates the terror in the first place?There’s a bigger fear too.In 1980, the Protect and Survive leaflet dropped through our letterbox, advising families on how to protect themselves in the event of nuclear attack. I was 19 and took the advice seriously, determined to do what I could to face off the threat of nuclear war. My dad had been in Hiroshima after the bomb dropped, and I’d grown up knowing it must never happen again.When the leaflet arrived, I felt angry that the world was on the brink, yet resilient enough to believe my generation could save it. Forty years on, the war in Ukraine has turned the world upside down again. And I am in a different position. This world, my world, is scary. My only hope is to protect myself, to survive. Each day I work hard to shore up my mental health. I resist thinking about the future too much and try to believe those in charge will see sense, before it’s too late. For the world. And me.

Wed 1 Mar 2023 11.00 GMTLast modified on Mon 13 Mar 2023 21.18 GMTWhen the Tory party chair Nadhim Zahawi was sacked, back in January, I was at the food bank, where I work five days a week. Seeing him not being clear about his tax affairs made me think more than ever that those who have, help themselves, and those who haven’t, help each other. I listened as one woman, already struggling and with several children, was talking about how she’d taken in a homeless friend for a while.In the long months of January and February, when it’s cold and there is anxiety about paying energy bills, people have been struggling. We’ve had a couple of incidents of people coming in very distressed, people who thought they’d never need a food bank. They say: “We thought we could cope”, and they’ve been trying to extend what they’ve got in the cupboard, but actually we are there to help. People come in and feel low; the stigma is still there, regardless of what we tell them, but lots of us have experience of using a food bank. We say: “We’re all having weird things on toast.”I’ve signed up for a counselling course, and although I can’t offer professional support, I hope it just means I’ll know what to say instead of “Are you all right?” I’ve learned that listening helps. It is mentally hard work at the moment, but there are lots of lighter moments. I was playing with a woman’s two kids on the floor while their mum was getting advice, and they left with a Christmas selection box under their arm because we’re still giving them out. They had no idea they were at a food bank.Even pound shops don’t sell things for a pound any more. I’m juggling three jobs just to get by | Sharron SpiceRead moreThis month, a few months after I started my job, was the first time I got the universal credit payment that I was expecting. I didn’t have a fine taken out for the first time since August – but I still don’t know how taking a job will affect what benefits I can continue to get, and it means I’m being more careful than ever. I had my first full council tax bill the other day, which I knew would be going up now I’m working – I was paying about £15 a month and now it’s £162.I woke up in the morning with my hat on last week; I didn’t realise I’d gone to bed wearing it – because I do wear a hat indoors, and when the boiler broke recently, I was wearing a scarf and gloves too. For my birthday last week, I rented a movie on the TV – it was a fiver. We talked about going to the cinema but we had crisps in the house and a couple of beers, and it would have cost me a fiver just to get to the cinema and back on the bus. It was lovely, but it would have been nice to go out.I’ve started having jam sandwiches at work because they taste better than the cheap ham I was buying. You go too cheap and it’s not worth having. I buy the wonky veg, which is fine, and I make stews and on day three it becomes a soup because there’s not much left in it. It’s about making things stretch a little bit further.I still don’t know if I’m better or worse off financially by having a job, but it has done wonders for me. I told my mum I’d been to the pub with my friends after work, and she was over the moon for me, she said I’m a completely different person. I’m getting an identity, so I am upbeat, but I’m very aware of the precarious financial situation I’m in – but I can’t dwell on it.Sometimes it does feel like I’m just surviving though, rather than thriving – but I am not the person I was a year ago, that much I do know. It’s my money and I’ve earned it, and I have pride in that. I’m holding my head up a little bit higher even though I still love an orange sticker at the supermarket. The other day, the man in the shop said he’d got some meat he needed to shift for some new stock. “Just wait there,” he said, and he put some nice ham in the reduced section and I picked up two packets. I laughed and thought, he knows me well now. But it means I am having nice sandwiches this week.

Wed 22 Feb 2023 11.00 GMTLast modified on Thu 23 Feb 2023 09.04 GMTI don’t like asking for help. As a care leaver, I’ve always had to look after myself, but I’m not only looking after myself any more. I’m a single mum with four wonderful kids, and I can proudly say that they’ve never wanted for anything. That was until recently.I had always been able to provide a warm home for my kids, but due to the tripling of my energy bills, I had to tell them to put an extra jumper on or sit underneath a blanket to keep warm this winter. I’ve always managed to keep a stocked fridge and cupboards, and made sure my kids never go hungry; now, I’m leaning on food banks to feed them.When my energy bills went from £83 a month to £283 a month without warning, I had to cancel my direct debit and opt for a prepayment meter instead. Prepay meters are supposed to be for people managing a tight budget, yet they’re on a higher tariff, so I’m paying more for less energy. This was fine in the summer when the sun dried my clothes and kept my house warm; now, I need to power a tumble dryer and radiators if I’m going to keep my kids warm with clean clothes on their backs.I used to shoulder financial worries myself; now my kids have this burden, too. I’ve found myself timing their showers, and I spend most of my time chasing them around the house, ensuring they have turned off electronics and lights when they’re not using them.I don’t mind tightening my belt, as I’ve never had loads of money to play with. Being frugal is a discipline I’ve instilled in my kids, so I’m fortunate not to be under pressure to keep up with the latest fashion trends, gadgets and other fads. My kids enjoy spending time at charity shops and discount stores hunting for bargains. Still, I worry that looking after the pennies won’t be enough soon.The energy sector isn’t ‘broken’, it’s cooking on gas – if you’re a profit-hungry shareholder | Mathew LawrenceRead moreI’m a full-time care worker and specialise in elderly care, but I would be better off working in a supermarket or behind a bar due to how little I make. I need a car to do my work, and my employer doesn’t subsidise petrol or other costs that running a vehicle incurs. Compared with the people I work with, though, I’ve got it easy. Some of my clients have spent their whole life savings – sometimes hundreds of thousands of pounds – on in-home care. One client, let’s call him Fred, spent £500,000 on care. He paid for his wife’s care before she died, and then he became unwell and needed four visits a day. He worried that he’d lose his house as he watched his savings dwindle away.I used to plan Fred’s meals carefully, and it was imperative that he stuck to these plans, or he would risk becoming hospitalised. Of course, when his money ran out, my company dropped him, and then another company took over and dropped the care package I had carefully designed for him. So, as predicted, he ended up in hospital, and I never saw him again. He lost everything before he died just because he needed help.I had to spend more than five hours with another service user last year as he waited for an ambulance after a fall. Five hours while he writhed in pain. Sometimes I leave work in tears, only to come home to more and more pressure.I do love my job, the relationships I have with my clients and spending precious time with them, but some days I wonder if it is worth the stress. I know people who sit at a checkout all day and make more money than me doing far fewer hours. I love helping people, but this crisis is causing me to think more selfishly, and I hate it.

Tue 14 Feb 2023 12.00 GMTLast modified on Tue 14 Feb 2023 17.30 GMTI’ve just finished my day shift at the pupil referral unit I work for, and I’m on my way to a three-hour shift doing youth work this evening. When I get home I’ll start work on the Open University assignment I have due in. Is it too much? Probably. But I think unless you are well off, everyone is the same at the moment. I’ve always had a second job, so it’s not new to me. Second, third, whatever. I’m juggling so I don’t drop the balls. But now, even nurses are getting second jobs.What’s stressing me out is I can’t take any holiday. Because if I don’t work, I don’t get paid. My main job is through an agency, and I’m contracted. I had a tooth infection recently and that was five days without any pay because I was ill. I think I need to look for a five-day-a-week PAYE job. Then I can still do my part-time youth work and the Saturday job I have, which is supervising reparation work with young people who are giving back to the community by picking up litter.I have an NHS dentist but because I work – even though I’m on a low salary – I have to pay. This is why people are not going to the dentist but going DIY. It costs me £23.80 every time I need to see the dentist and £9.35 for each prescription. If you’re on a low wage, that’s a lot of money. My tooth needs to be extracted, but I have odontophobia so I need to be sedated. I will have to pay for the sedation. I have to sort it out because If I don’t have my health, I can’t work – and then I don’t have any income.I work 50 hours a week and I’m still in arrears on my council tax. What more can I do? | Sharron SpiceRead moreI’ve started to look for a new job. Council jobs, charity jobs, still in the same sector. I look at the weekend, in the evening. I’ve got my CV out there on job apps, Reed, Indeed and so on. Because I’m not in a proper salaried job earning enough money, I have to do all the other jobs. But once I have my Open University degree in youth justice, I will be on a good salary. I’m halfway through: only another three years.I started the year with a feeling of a fresh start, but with everything going on in parliament and how the government is treating the nurses, and Rishi Sunak not listening … It makes me feel sad, how we as a people are being treated. Tory sleaze every day, a drip, drip, drip effect. Nadhim Zahawi’s tax fine made me so angry. I feel like the government is actually sticking two fingers up at us, saying: “You minions, you need to pay tax. But we are of a different ilk to you so deserve better.” There’s no accountability. There’s no respectability.It feels like things are a lot tougher. Some of the cheap stores, the pound shops, are not selling anything for £1, they have put everything up by 20p so it’s £1.19 or £1.20. They used to be cheaper than Superdrug for toiletries, mouthwash, things like that. I went to one recently that used to sell everything for a pound. Now nothing’s a pound in there. It needs to change its name.But even though I am finding it tough, I appreciate what I have and give thought to those that have less. For that I am grateful. I am working, I have jobs, and a roof over my head. And thank you to those people who got in touch to show support and positive feedback from my last article.

Now I feel I’m doing something usefulMon 22 May 2023 08.00 BSTLast modified on Mon 22 May 2023 10.25 BSTMy clown-white facepaint makes my skin feel tight and I’m scared my elaborate headdress is going to slip. It’s my first outing with the Red Rebel Brigade, the silent climate activist performance group. About a dozen of us are clad in robes, veils and evening gloves – all a bright blood-red. We glide to our local Barclays bank to stand in a tableau of grief. We are meant to aim for the faraway stare of “a watcher through the ages”, but I’m afraid I look more like someone stuck in a slow queue at Sainsbury’s. I suddenly catch the eye of someone I know as they walk past, staring at me like I’m bonkers. But I’ve tried the sensible ways of doing something about the climate crisis. I’ve written letters to politicians, carried placards and had endless conversations. At best, I just put people’s backs up. So I’ve decided to shut up and wrap myself in a red sheet instead.Two years before this, on the morning of 9 September 2020, I woke in my home in Berkeley, California, to a Plutonian twilight. Smoke from the latest wildfire had mixed with the fog in a blanket that shorter wavelengths of light couldn’t penetrate. I tried to explain away the darkness to my kids but I felt like a parent in biblical Egypt, claiming everything was fine while frogs rained from the sky. My husband and I had worried about California’s escalating drought and wildfires for years, but after Orange Skies Day we decided we’d had enough. Time to move back to my native UK. (Unlike millions displaced by the climate crisis, we were privileged to have this option.)Once we got here, people wondered why on earth we’d leave sunny California. I told the truth: “Because of the climate apocalypse.” After politely ascertaining that wildfires hadn’t actually burned our house down, people couldn’t change the topic fast enough. But I didn’t take the hint. Since nearly everything we do has a carbon cost, every conversation led to the climate crisis. When my parents posted pictures of themselves basking in the Spanish heatwave on the family WhatsApp chat, I responded: “The world’s getting hotter fast. Who wants to join me at the next climate protest?” Awkward silence ensued. In his book Don’t Even Think About It, about why we ignore climate breakdown, George Marshall says that when he brings it up “the words collapse, sink and die in mid-air, and the conversation suddenly changes course. It is like an invisible force field.” Yep.A wildfire in Oroville, California, 9 September 2020. Photograph: Josh Edelson/AFP/Getty ImagesI joined my local Extinction Rebellion group and they told me the best way to start conversations about climate was not to talk, but to listen. After that, instead of telling people how worried I was, I asked if they were worried. “Yes, but I recycle,” said a neighbour at a picnic. “Can I have your tart recipe?” That night, while doom-scrolling, I saw a picture of the Red Rebels and felt an instant connection: here were people who didn’t downplay their climate grief for the sake of others. They flaunted it. At last, here was an outlet for my climate emotions.At my first outing as a Red, I expect to feel anxious and exposed, but it’s unexpectedly restorative. I can’t answer texts during our performances, and my kids can’t ask me for snacks. Passersby follow us and even want to strike up conversations. But I just raise my hands as if holding an invisible chalice, my go-to pose. I’m blissfully silent. It’s relaxing to be the one exerting the invisible force field.I’ve been in the grip of astrology all my life, so why am I turning my back on the stars? | Daisy JonesRead moreA week later, at a barbecue, something amazing happens: I don’t feel the urge to tell everyone about plant-based burgers, but just enjoy myself instead. And when I go to see my sister’s new kitchen extension I don’t ask about its carbon footprint, but admire her stylish skylights. I no longer feel the need to rant about the climate in daily interaction. I’m less angry with other people because I’m less angry with myself. I feel as if I’m doing something useful.But in April, I have a moment of doubt. I join more than 70 Reds as part of Extinction Rebellion’s protest weekend in London, and afterwards, looking at all the photos, I ask myself: is this just about looking amazing? But then I remember the wonder on onlookers’ faces. Some cry. Some call us “spawn of Satan” or shout about “climate conspiracy”, but we always inspire big emotions.I hope the emotion that people tap into will drive them to act. Other forms of activism are valuable, but as a Red, I can see the effect I’m having on people’s faces. Talking to people about the climate crisis made me feel hopeless. Striking a mute pose of despair? Remarkably uplifting.

But cancer gave me a buzzcut and helped me find my voiceJoanne HarrisAs an author and a woman, I felt my role was to be scrutinised, yet not to speak out. Now, nobody shuts me upMon 15 May 2023 10.00 BSTLast modified on Tue 16 May 2023 08.15 BSTThere’s a saying my grandmother liked to use: little girls should be seen and not heard. I internalised that idea for much of my life, but when I was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2020, something changed. Cancer took a great deal from me, but it gave me back my voice, and now I don’t think I’ll ever be silent again.I must have been a difficult child. Much of my childhood features people telling me to be quiet. Schoolteachers. Family members. The man who tried to rape me. The adult who, when I told her, and after having satisfied herself that nothing much had happened, decided that it would be best for me never to mention it again.At school I was labelled “dogmatic” by a teacher who liked to stare down my blouse during lessons. When I called him out, I acquired the additional label of “troublemaker”. And so I grew up believing that silence was a virtue. I became self-conscious about my voice and its effect on others. I was already more than self-conscious about the effect my appearance had on others, and did my best to mitigate this by hiding behind a curtain of hair. For a time, I forgot what it felt like to be myself, except in the safe space of the page, free from scrutiny and judgment.When my third book became unexpectedly successful, I was suddenly under more scrutiny than I’d ever known before. No more than was directed at any other successful woman, but enough to help confirm the voices of my childhood: that when you’re a woman, physical appearance is the first thing people notice; and that no one wants you to be loud, or flippant, or opinionated. My agent agreed. A grande dame in the old style, she took me in hand in a manner that brooked no refusal: decided what I should wear, what I should say, what I should write next and how best to keep out of trouble. The implication was clear: if I showed my true self, if I failed to conform to her expectations, if I spoke out about my politics – in short, if I was difficult – then something dreadful would happen.But in spite of this, somehow my voice was coming to life. It started with being a mother. My instinct to protect my child brought out my confrontational streak. I became a troublemaker again, at least in certain circumstances. But a lifetime of self-effacement takes a lot of breaking down. It took me another 20 years to learn to be myself again.By the time my agent and I parted ways, the internet had taken over as arbiter of what I should be. Women on the internet are often commented upon, told their experiences don’t count. When they push back, they receive abuse. For someone like me, raised on keeping the peace, it was sometimes tempting simply not to engage.But some events are too huge for that. The US election of Donald Trump, then Brexit, Covid, lockdown and Boris Johnson’s premiership seemed to demand some comment. On those issues, at least, I found myself growing outspoken. I got the usual abuse in response, even the occasional death threat. It was upsetting, but not as much as I’d imagined. With age comes a feeling of “fuck you”. Menopause had made me rethink my relationship with my body. Insults about my appearance made little impression on me. Even 20 years before, I’d never understood the need for strangers to see me as sexy.Then I got cancer. I spoke about that online, too, and found that others in the same situation found it comforting to hear about my experience. There was something oddly liberating in actually saying something was wrong. My old agent would have been horrified: she hid her own cancer treatment from everyone – including me – for fear of revealing weakness. I didn’t feel weak, however. I felt as if, at long last, I had taken back control. I declined the offer of a wig and opted to shave my head before chemo took my hair.Suddenly there was more to life than worrying about optics. So what if I didn’t look as people expected me to? So what if I expressed a view that made someone else despise me? I realised that I had been hiding away – under my hair, under my fear of upsetting people – all my life. Now, in the face of cancer, I felt I’d rediscovered myself. Acknowledging the effects, the fear – felt like a superpower. My scale of priorities had shifted. The dreadful thing had already happened. What was left for me to fear? I found myself engaging in discussions I would have avoided 12 months before. An angry man on Twitter lambasted me for my “woke hair”. I laughed to think he’d mistaken my chemo buzzcut for a political statement.Three years later, I’m cancer-free. My body has mostly recovered. Even my hair has begun to grow back. But the effect remains. I no longer stay silent for fear of causing trouble.Recently, I found the origin of the “seen and not heard” saying in a collection of old English proverbs by an Augustinian clergyman called John Mirk in 1450: A mayde schuld be seen, but not herd – although if Mirk already considered the proverb old, then it must have dated from long before that. Remembering his advice, I wonder what he would have said to a woman who was no longer a mayde? I like to think he learned the hard way. I like to think that some 15th-century version of me told him “fucke you”, and left him forever speechless.

It was time to come clean about my real passions – whether those around me liked it or notMeg Cabot is the author of over 90 books for adults and children, including the Princess DiariesMon 8 May 2023 07.00 BSTLast modified on Tue 9 May 2023 12.40 BSTCabot’s got no hustle.” I was 10 years old when I overheard the coach of my girls’ softball team utter these words. I could see Coach standing in the bright sunlight of the ball field, but she couldn’t see me – I was huddled deep in the cool shade of the dugout, where I admittedly spent most of my time during practice and games. She had no idea I was listening to every word she said.“I’d play Cabot more,” Coach complained to our assistant coach, who was standing beside her with a clipboard. “But she just won’t hustle.”The conversation moved on to who, out of my fellow players, Coach was going to substitute for me, and I leaned back into the dugout, shocked by what I’d heard. Me, no hustle? How could anyone think that?It’s true I didn’t really like softball. Oh, I loved the part where you went up to bat to hit the ball. That was fun. But the rest of the game – where you had to stand out in the field hoping no balls would fly your way because then you might have to catch them – was less thrilling to me. Worse, I was terrible at it, to the detriment of the team. Mostly I just stared at the treetops past the field, thinking of whatever story I was writing at the moment. This is how I was often hit in the head with balls, and ended up sitting in the dugout.But did this indicate a lack of hustle? This seemed harsh, even to my 10-year-old, probably concussed brain.True, the only reason I stayed on the team was because my best friend was on it, and I liked hanging out with her on the bus. Then there was my professor father who’d gone to college on a basketball scholarship, and was very proud that I’d finally expressed an interest in anything other than reading or writing.I’d been writing stories for as long as I could remember. I had already written pages and pages of Star Wars fan fiction – not online, of course, because back then online didn’t exist. No, I’d handwritten them, for fun, along with dozens of short stories and even novels, one of which I was particularly proud of, about the princess of a foreign land who needed the help of a handsome, lonely knight to save her throne.I knew better than to tell anyone, especially Coach, that I wanted to be a published writer when I grew up, though. For one thing, living in a college town, nearly every adult I knew was a published writer. They were all very serious and depressed. I’d watched them struggling over their work, taking years to produce a single textbook that would end up being bought by no one except their own students.This was not the kind of career I meant when I thought about being a writer.And for another, no sane parent is going to support their child’s dream of making up stories for a living. Even Shakespeare’s parents had to have told him at some point that being a playwright wasn’t a very realistic career goal. Mine let me know at an early age that while my stories about princesses were cute, I needed to be prepared to support myself some other way, with a “backup career”.That’s why, in addition to softball, my mom enrolled me in typing class. At the very least, she said, I could be someone’s secretary when I grew up. And since I was learning to type my books about princesses at 50 words per minute, instead of handwriting them, I wasn’t complaining.So while I couldn’t say my commitment to sports was ever very strong, for Coach to say I didn’t have any hustle? I was flabbergasted. I had more hustle than any other 10-year-old I knew!It took me until the end of the bus ride home after that game (which of course we lost) for me to realise that Coach may actually have been on to something. I spent the long, dusty ride cheerfully filling my teammates in on the latest chapter of Princess and the Lonely Knight, soothing them after our terrible loss, and giving them something to look forward to: not our next game (which we would surely lose), but the next chapter.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to BookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books with our expert reviews, author interviews and top 10s.

I couldn’t wait to get home to write it!That’s when it hit me: Coach was right. I didn’t have hustle. Not for softball, anyway. I had all the hustle in the world for things I actually cared about, like writing and typing and my friends. But sports? Not so much.So I realised I had no choice. I broke the news to my dad (and later, to Coach and my best friend) the next day: I was quitting softball. My heart wasn’t in it.And because my heart wasn’t in it, I was only hurting the team – and myself – by spending time doing an activity I didn’t enjoy, when I could be doing what really mattered: hustling at what I loved.

Yet the fertility industry kept offering us hope, so long as we offered them moneyMon 1 May 2023 08.00 BSTLast modified on Mon 1 May 2023 18.13 BSTIs it possible to become addicted to fertility treatment? When does spending tens of thousands of pounds on IVF with no guarantee that it will actually work become a gambling problem? These are the questions I am searching for answers to as I meet virtually with a doctor from a top London fertility clinic. “Women are a mystery,” he jokes. I smile politely into the tiny camera on my laptop. I had been considering treatment with his clinic and we have spent the last hour running through my history of infertility, or rather, in my case, incomplete fertility.My husband and I have been trying for nine years to have a baby. I’m quite good at getting pregnant, especially when we first started trying, but I can’t seem to stay pregnant. I don’t know why. And as it turns out, neither do the experts. I have spent years seeking their help, and because IVF wasn’t available on the NHS in my area, I have paid thousands of pounds along the way in my relentless pursuit of pregnancy.IVF can be an invaluable blessing, and I know so many people who have benefited from the treatment. But there are no guarantees. Despite the tremendous costs associated with private IVF treatment, according to the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, the average live birth rate for IVF patients under 35 is around 32% per embryo transferred. For patients older than 35, the stats decrease significantly by age. Those are pretty bad odds for success, but like thousands of women in the UK, I tried my luck.Early in our journey, we were labelled as a case of “unexplained infertility”. And while that sounds as if it should be an anomaly, in reality at least 25% of infertility cases in the UK today are classified as unexplained, a mystery.‘Ovulation kits, fertility smoothies, maca powder, royal jelly, acupuncture, massages, coaches and countless pricey pregnancy tests – I’ve paid for them all.’ Photograph: Janine Wiedel/AlamyFor me, “unexplained” is the worst diagnosis of all. If I had one of the common causes of infertility, such as polycystic ovaries, irregular periods or endometriosis, or if my husband had a male infertility factor, we could target the problem and treat it.But after all the tests – and we’ve had them all – we are painfully, extraordinarily, normal.One clinic was honest in its assessment that it could not identify why our pregnancies wouldn’t last, and advised me not to continue the physical burden of IVF. It refunded us part of the cost when its treatments weren’t successful.How IVF became a licence to print moneyRead moreOthers were not so kind. Treatment at the most expensive clinic I went to, a Harley Street stalwart, left me physically bruised, financially depleted and none the wiser. My final interaction with them was a 15-minute consultation, weeks after my failed cycle, in which the doctor shuffled through my papers and said: “It should have worked, we did everything right. Try again.”And so, I did.But after further unsuccessful cycles, I started to realise that IVF treatment is more art than science. My experience was that IVF is experimental, each clinic offering different cocktails of medicines, treatment plans and “add-ons”.I tried every option available to me. Cycle after cycle, I gained weight, lost control of my moods, and for years I was anchored in a constant state of grief. But the urge to keep trying refused to disappear.Despite my efforts not to fall for the promise of IVF again, curiosity and temptation got the better of me. Maybe another clinic could help? Maybe it could offer something new, something different, that the others couldn’t?And so, I found myself speaking to this new doctor on my laptop. “You are too young and too healthy to give up,” he said. He suggested a strategy and a three-cycle package for us to consider. And so I tried again. I was meticulous in execution but despite our “excellent” graded embryos and my healthy uterus, the cycles failed.It was a painful reminder that this is how the fertility business works. I could be tempted to pay thousands to treat an undiagnosed condition. A schedule of appointments, injections and procedures could offer me a comforting, yet false, sense of control in an otherwise bewildering experience.IVF clinics are a business first and foremost, and the private fertility industry in the UK alone is worth more than £320m annually. The model relies on patients like me trying, failing, then paying to try again. And again. And again. Until it works. Maybe.It’s not just the private clinics. Beyond sparse regulation, the booming fertility market is a free-for-all, crowded with pseudoscientific products aimed at desperate women. Ovulation kits, fertility smoothies, maca powder, royal jelly, prenatal supplements, acupuncture, massages, coaches and countless pricey pregnancy tests – I’ve paid for them all.It’s irresistible when the one thing they sell above all else is hope.It took me nearly a decade, but I realised that IVF works for the lucky few, and I wasn’t one of them. And so, I finally quit. I conceded that the toll it was taking on my body and my mental health was not worth it. I had vanished. My identity, my time, the light inside of me, all diminished. I decided I needed to regain control of my body.Working on a beauty counter had a devastating effect on my self-esteem | Elizabeth McCaffertyRead moreI am considered a case of “unexplained infertility” because there are gaping holes in the scientific understanding of how life is created, why miscarriage happens and why some of us struggle to conceive, even in the best of circumstances. My doctor was right, women’s health is still too often shrouded in mystery.It’s fair to say that my IVF days are over. But I won’t give up hope of having a healthy baby one day. I also hope to see change in the fertility industry. I hope that assisted fertility becomes a less traumatic experience for patients; that more regulation is put in place to curb the ever-rising costs of treatment, and that “success rates” are calculated on personalised data based on patient diagnosis. I also hope for fairer marketing practices that would allow patients to make more informed choices, and for continued research to develop treatments with more promising success rates. Above all, I hope that society wakes up to this silent crisis in women’s health happening all around us.

Here’s what Keir Starmer can learn from itClaire AinsleyTurning Labour’s revival into a durable majority is possible – but only if it delivers the changes people are crying out for Claire Ainsley was Labour’s executive director of policy from 2020 to 2022Tue 16 May 2023 12.00 BSTLast modified on Wed 17 May 2023 09.02 BSTThose of us who desperately want to see the back of this dismal Conservative government should take heart from the recent local elections in England. We should also be encouraged by the successes of the centre left around the world, which has defeated the political right in elections in Australia, Germany, Spain, Portugal and the US, after a dramatic decline in support for social democratic parties after the 2008 financial crisis.But if we can learn one thing from these recent successes, it is that there is nothing inevitable about the return of social democracy. Granted, after the pandemic, many voters have grown weary of the failure of the political right to address their need for security and prosperity as they face the cost of living crisis. But voters everywhere remain sceptical of the ability of politics and politicians, from all parties, to act in their interests. They are sceptical too of the capacity for government to change their lives for the better, at a time when we badly need to renew the modern state in the face of the perma-crises hitting all our nations.The metaphor that the pendulum inevitably swings back from right to left and back again ignores the simple fact that of the 123 years of the Labour party’s existence, it has only been in power for just over 30 of them. If there is a pendulum, it gets stubbornly stuck on one side. The UK Labour party needs to take learning, not comfort, from the tentative revival of the centre left.Undoubtedly, Scott Morrison in Australia and Donald Trump in the US were divisive and unpopular incumbents. The Australian Labor party learned from its defeat by Morrison in 2019 not to overload the prospectus for government, and came back with clear, bold pledges in 2022. Anthony Albanese was the voice of hopeful, safe change for Australia, carrying a positive message in the run-up to the campaign, with practical, deliverable promises on the people’s priorities.Similarly the Social Democratic party in Germany made four big simple pledges to back its grander missions for government. These successful sister parties have modelled a steady and unifying leadership in contrast to the divisive politics of their opponents, backed by solid social democratic platforms on wages, pensions and public services that resonate with people’s need for security and prosperity after the pandemic.‘Australian prime minister Anthony Albanese (centre) has just announced a slew of reforms to tackle some of the structural problems such as older care and childcare.’ Photograph: Matt Turner/AAPIn the UK, there is no route to a parliamentary majority for Labour without reconstituting the historical coalition between today’s working-class voters and liberal-leaning middle-class voters. Of course, their forms have changed over time and election results with different voting systems are reflecting that societal fragmentation. Today’s working class is multi-ethnic, more likely to be female, and living and working in towns and cities across the country – and there is simply no way to get a parliamentary majority without them. For Labour that means realigning with new working-class voters. And the local election results back polling that shows Labour is ahead again among working-class voters.Whether this tentative revival can be turned into durable majorities will rest on whether we can deliver the change that people are crying out for. If voters give the centre left the chance to be in government again, then the changes Labour instigates must make a difference to people’s lives, not just win plaudits in the abstract. This is “kitchen table economics”, to coin a phrase from the Australians. Despite the highfalutin speak of policy experts, it is much, much harder these days to translate policy change into real-world improvements in people’s pockets. The old playbook from left or right of a pay out or a tax cut won’t work in an era when these can be cancelled out by the next gas bill.Are you hoping for a progressive alliance to oust the Tories? Don’t hold your breath | Martin KettleRead moreKeir Starmer’s embrace of a mission-driven approach to government provides the opportunity to tackle the root causes of stagnating wages and volatile costs, as well as offer help now. On the back of strong jobs growth, Albanese’s government has just announced a slew of reforms to provide assistance with the cost of living, tackle some of the structural problems such as older care and childcare, and bring the budget back into surplus. Being streamlined and disciplined during a campaign does not have to inhibit serious-minded reform in government.Around the world, rightwing populists remain a serious electoral presence. The forces that brought them to the fore have accelerated rather than slowed. They are winning larger shares of the vote, as shown in the recent elections in Italy and Sweden. Marine Le Pen is outpolling Emmanuel Macron in France. Donald Trump is outpolling Joe Biden ahead of the presidential elections next year. This week, London is hosting a three-day jamboree of right-leaning self-styled NatCons. Make no mistake, there is a battle on, and it is a battle for the future of our nations that will be fought in the media and conversations in our towns, suburbs and neighbourhoods.In three years, Starmer has taken the Labour party further and faster than many thought imaginable. After the encouraging result at the local elections, Labour now offers the hope that a better future for our country is possible. But that must be grounded in a practical programme to improve people’s prospects. Only then will we have earned the trust we ask for.

You have to raise your gameThis article is more than 1 month oldJohn HarrisA Labour win still seems likely, but where’s the narrative? As the Tories shift further right, the stakes couldn’t be higherSun 16 Apr 2023 12.44 BSTLast modified on Mon 17 Apr 2023 02.28 BSTOnly six weeks ago, Keir Starmer’s Labour party seemed locked into the mood of optimism and quiet delight that had started to cohere over the previous autumn. Polls continued to show leads over the Tories of about 25 percentage points. Starmer was guardedly looking ahead to two terms in office and “a decade of national renewal”. Rishi Sunak and his allies, by contrast, were synonymous with disruption, impossible living costs and the state of constant internal chaos labelled “long Johnson”. We were still heading, it seemed, for one of those moments when a tired and divided ruling party simply collapses, and change becomes inevitable.Maybe we still are. Whenever the next election arrives, Conservative defeat is still the most likely outcome. But as MPs prepare to return after the Easter recess, the battle between the two big Westminster parties has subtly shifted. Labour’s average poll lead is now in the teens rather than 20s, Starmer and Sunak’s personal ratings are almost even, and gurus of political gambling have been heard advising against any bets on an outright Labour win. The key reasons why are not hard to work out: notwithstanding such grinding problems as the ongoing strikes in the NHS, Sunak is just about managing to look like an efficient, stable, confident kind of leader, while Starmer seems stuck – ahead, but coasting.There is an obvious response to that – which Labour people know by heart – and that is, given the calamity of the 2019 result, everything is going better than anyone could have reasonably expected. But does Starmer seem insurgent? To what extent do his arguments and ideas cut through to voters? How far is he from that point when would-be prime ministers so dominate the political conversation that the move from opposition to government seems almost inevitable? Given the huge trail of Tory wreckage that has mounted up over 13 years and the recent anarchy at the top, these are questions that ought to make Labour people uneasy, at least.Starmer and Labour’s senior shadow ministers still mostly speak in a deadening political argot full of abstract nouns and concepts that have little resonance in people’s everyday lives. A year ago, his pitch to the public was all about “security”, “prosperity” and “respect”; now, he and his team want to “build a better Britain” that will supposedly push ahead in the “global race”. Insurgency requires energy, pace and emotional intelligence, but he seems slow, leaden and strangely cold.His key weakness is much the same as it has always been – the absence of a story about who he is, the condition of the country he wants to govern, and how Britain needs to change. And in that sense, there are grim historical echoes: Starmerism, if such a thing exists, is as reminiscent of New Labour as its admirers sometimes claim, but less suggestive of 1997’s glories than the murky years – from 2005 to 2010, roughly – when that project lost its way, got lost in internal battling, chased votes in the basest ways possible, and headed for defeat.Back then, progressive intentions and big ideas were often lost in loud talk about “yobs”, making foreign nationals carry ID cards, and welfare cheats. Now, Labour promises crackdowns and “respect orders” – Tony Blair’s old adage about being tough on both crime and the causes of crime seems to have lost its second half – and says it is keeping a close eye on the cost of benefit fraud. The imperative, it seems, is to echo the supposed views of the so-called hero voters in seats Labour recently lost to the Tories, with any unease from leftwing faint-hearts cited as welcome proof that the leader is, to use his chosen word, “ruthless”. Meanwhile, tactics and strategy still seem woefully incoherent. Up until the recent spurt of crass anti-Sunak attack ads – defended over the weekend by the deputy Labour leader Angela Rayner as “no-nonsense” and “factual” – there was a drive to make Starmer’s lack of political experience an asset and portray him as a dutiful public servant uninterested in the usual Westminster games: now, he looks like the opposite.All this matters for two very big reasons. First, as those tightening polls suggest, Labour’s underperformance still leaves room for a Conservative revival and a narrow election win. And there is another set of possibilities, fraught with different risks: Labour taking power with a small Commons majority – or as a minority administration, whose fragility would be sealed by Starmer’s explicit rejection of coalitions or agreements with other parties. As things stand, without a defining narrative or much of a relationship with the electorate, either scenario would reveal Labour as a precarious political force, at the mercy of both events and its adversaries.No one should underestimate what a Starmer-led government would be up against, even if Labour won outright. The UK economy remains in a perilous state, not least in the context of continued fears about the stability of the global banking system. The effects of Brexit now play out in the kind of visceral scenes – queues and shortages, chiefly – that any government should fear. Thanks in part to Labour’s nervous embrace of spending restraint, our public services will still be vulnerable to crises and meltdowns.And then there are the dangers of a reborn Tory party. A couple of weeks ago, I had a long conversation with the academic Tim Bale, who has just published an impressive book, The Conservative Party After Brexit, subtitled “turmoil and transformation”. When we talked about the prospect of Tory defeat and what might follow it, he highlighted the near-disappearance of centrist Conservative voices and the likelihood of a reversion to the kind of hard-right instincts that Sunak has managed to smooth over. The next leadership contest, he said, may well be between Kemi Badenoch and Suella Braverman. The former would mix her populist, Brexity aspects with the kind of free-marketry that so spectacularly imploded when Liz Truss was in charge; the latter would take her party perilously close to the kind of organised nastiness pioneered by such politicians as Nigel Farage and Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán.In either scenario, the Tories would be backed by a fierce and formidable machine: the rightwing press, internet provocateurs, and the deeply anti-Labour voices now given a daily platform by TalkTV and GB News. More than ever before, every national mishap would be amplified into a crisis, and Labour failure would present a huge opportunity; even, come an election, the chance to finally see off everything deemed “woke” and to finish whatever deranged post-Brexit business the Tories had left unfinished.Those are the stakes. And in that sense, drawing attention to Starmer’s shortcomings ought not to be a matter of factional fighting or ideological point-scoring, but something much more universal: a reminder that for all our sakes, he urgently needs to up his game.

Under Anas Sarwar’s leadership, the party has gone from potential political extinction to consistently polling about 29%, which would result in around 15 seats in the general election – up from the current total of one.There is no room for complacency, though. A likable leader in Scotland, and a UK leader who looks on track to be the next prime minister, mean that Scottish voters are considering Labour as a serious electoral force again, but there is still much work to be done.It is virtually impossible for the Labour party to form a majority government without winning seats in Scotland, and every seat Labour wins in Scotland reduces the target that Keir Starmer needs nationally to get a majority.The messages that a Labour government runs through Scotland and that we were the “first red wall to fall” cannot be repeated enough. Starmer and his shadow cabinet clearly understand this as they are now regular visitors to Scotland.Last year, the Scottish Fabians analysed the granular geographical and voter-preference data generated by the recent local elections, and demonstrated that squeezing SNP and Green voters and identifying those most likely to switch to Labour could mean 25 seats for Labour in Scotland. If Labour can win over just one in five SNP voters, 20 seats are within its grasp.These seats all occupy Scotland’s political middle ground and were the former Labour heartlands in Scotland. Slugging it out with the Tories to be the “no compromise” pro-UK party is an electoral dead end. Labour cannot make the gains it needs by squeezing the unionist vote. Even with the Tory vote at an all-time low it is impossible to win more than four seats without winning votes from the SNP.Those votes will be available. The new first minister, Humza Yousaf, does not share his predecessor’s formidable reputation for competence and communication, and inherits a long list of domestic problems, which as the continuity candidate he cannot distance himself from. The crisis in our NHS has happened under his tenure as health secretary.On Monday, his first action was deeply unserious, announcing he would request a section 30 order to hold a second independence referendum, an idea that the prime minister immediately turned down. So far, so depressingly predictable. The path for Labour is clear. It must avoid the “no compromise” unionism versus independence stances that the SNP and Tories – bereft of other ideas – are locked into. Promisingly, it is beginning to look like the Scottish people have other ideas as well.Keir Starmer tells SNP voters: Labour will shift power from LondonRead moreThe Scottish Fabians have also conducted focus groups with previous SNP voters who are now undecided in key seats. It is clear that none felt the time was right for another independence referendum. These voters are struggling to make ends meet, heat their homes and access healthcare. They told us they were on the fence about who to support in a general election, but it is clear they are desperate for change.These target voters range from young families budgeting to meet needs in low-cost homes, aspirational younger households in private suburbs, and older, more stable homeowners. Our target seats, such as Hamilton and Clyde Valley, East Lothian, and Midlothian, are where these younger, more aspirational voters make up a large proportion of people living in middle-value properties, perhaps moving to one of the new housing estates there to start or expand their families. It is these voters Labour must target and in these estates that it must campaign.Labour must offer the change these voters so desperately want and must convince voters it has answers to the economic insecurities and failing public services that blight their lives. There is an organisational challenge for Scottish Labour to address. Winning 25 seats requires the best candidates in the right seats with skilled campaign teams to deliver Labour’s message of a reformed UK to these undecided voters.There were a number of seats in which Scottish Labour outperformed expectations in local elections demographically, and the recommended next steps for the party would be to look at why it outperformed – and see if there are lessons there for both UK and Scottish Labour on winning these seats back in a general election.Labour depends on Scotland to achieve a majority government and Scottish Labour’s future success means winning over a wide coalition of voters across Scotland’s towns and cities. These voters want a change to the status quo; it is the job of the Labour party to convince them that it can deliver that change through a Labour government.

Starmer’s purge of the left puts his future government in perilThis article is more than 3 months oldNeal LawsonWhen any leader says ‘it’s my way or the highway’ – as he effectively has – they sign their project’s death warrantThu 16 Feb 2023 10.14 GMTLast modified on Sun 26 Feb 2023 11.58 GMTAll political projects carry within them the seeds of their own destruction. Contradictions, paradoxes and limitations are hardwired through the context and conditions of their creation. An endpoint is built in at birth. After Keir Starmer’s announcement that Jeremy Corbyn will not be allowed to stand as a Labour candidate at the next election – the leader’s latest shut-up-or-ship-out message to the party’s left – the lifetime of any incoming Labour or Labour-led government has been shortened, perhaps dramatically.This is not about support for Corbynism or leftwing ideas per se. Instead, it is to argue that in an age of increasing complexity, chaos and confusion any political project must have an agility, nimbleness and fluidity that allows it to forge ever-changing intellectual and movement alliances. Pragmatic politics is now defined by openness – not the closure of debate he has called for with a legitimate, though some would say misguided, wing of his party.The argument Starmer is making seems to be this: shut up, let us get into government and we will pull the policy levers because we know what’s best for you.Of course, we know why he’s making it. Like Tony Blair, he believes the only route to office is by proving to the already powerful in the media and the City that Labour will not rock their boat. But unless their growth and greed boat is rocked, Labour is doomed to fail. The real question is how cleverly and effectively we rock that boat and over what time period? To do so requires the skills and the culture Starmer is turning his back on.In the 1950s, the psychiatrist and cyberneticist W Ross Ashby devised the Law of Requisite Variety, which stated that any body or organisation can only be effectively governed by a system that is equally complex. Simple organisations can be governed in simple ways, but a complex society such as ours demands complex systems of governance.Because we know what happens when any leader says “it’s my way or the highway”: they sign their own death warrant. The demand for obedience is the opposite of the feedback, challenge, creativity and innovation that successful modern politics demands. Withdrawing into a corner and defining anyone who fails to support you as an enemy just narrows the scope of your own vision and capacity to act. Most leaders end up on their own, few start there.The Italian political theorist Antonio Gramsci said there is always at least a grain of truth in your opponent’s argument. Starmer would be better listening to the left and synthesising any useful elements of its critique into a more robust and less brittle project. This is a politics of possibility because it is dynamic and not static: a politics based on the key ingredient of successful leadership – the ability to listen. In the 21st century, effective and enduring leadership is defined not by arrogant “get with it or get out of it” chest-beating, but by the careful curation of ideas, talent and networks: a new radical consensus, not dull conformity.This senseless lawsuit could bankrupt the Labour party and let the Tories win again | George MonbiotRead moreTo be fair to Starmer, his purge of the left is simply a more thorough and better organised version of what has gone before. The left under Corbyn promised deselections but never got round to them, while Blairism extinguished the left as much through ridicule as through the rulebook.Of course, the Conservative and now – minus Nicola Sturgeon – a possible SNP implosion could well see Starmer fall over the line first, but then what? Without roots in ideas and social energy, without the ability to renew and regenerate itself intellectually and culturally, his project will wither. The question is how fast and what will fill the vacuum?The idea that one small faction of one party can rule the chaotic waves of the 21st century is a non-starter. Neither Starmer nor anyone else is going to impose a better future on us; that can only be negotiated by all of us. For that to happen in our country, the skills and the tools have to be honed within the Labour party first.

Staff and students have had enoughWed 15 Mar 2023 11.00 GMTLast modified on Thu 16 Mar 2023 08.59 GMTOn 29 June 2022, all the staff at Queen Mary University of London, where I work, received an email from management. To our horror, they were threatening to withhold 100% of our pay for 21 days of both July and August, because we were participating in a marking boycott over pensions, pay, labour precarity, inequality and working conditions. Life in the higher education sector had been getting tougher ever since I started my career in 2017. But at that moment, I not only resolved to continue to strike, but redoubled my efforts to get as many colleagues as possible to join me on the picket lines. The condescension from my employers made me feel something stark and visceral.I hadn’t always felt so jaded. I finished my PhD in law in 2016 and was ready to begin a life of service in education and research, working in the subject I cared passionately about. But several things quickly became clear. There was the increasing precarity of university labour: one-third of academics are on fixed-term contracts, 41% are on hourly paid contracts and there are still 29 institutions employing at least five academic staff on zero-hours contract. In 2021, it was reported that pay had been cut by 20% in real-terms over the past 12 years, while changes to the pension scheme mean that we’ve taken a 35% cut to our guaranteed retirement income despite contributing more. Meanwhile, university and college staff are doing the equivalent of two days’ unpaid work every week on average. It’s an environment that leaves me feeling, like many others, disillusioned and questioning my future.At my university, the current round of industrial action has been going on since 2017. In 2022, the management had threatened to withhold 100% of staff wages because we had taken action short of strike (Asos). During Asos, staff work to contract and no more – no weekends preparing classes or volunteering for recruitment activities, no staying an extra couple of hours or working through lunch. We also refuse to reschedule or make up the teaching cancelled during strike action and engage in a marking and assessment boycott.The timing of the July and August pay deductions came as a shock to everyone. In the midst of the worst cost of living crisis for more than half a century, when my colleagues were struggling to pay rent, mortgages, childcare costs and student debt and when inflation and national insurance contributions had risen, the response of our management, many of whom earn six-figure salaries, was to deduct 42 days’ pay over two months.This demonstrated a complete disdain for the people who make the university, who attract thousands of students each year from all corners of the world, who produce world-class research that changes lives and improves our understanding of a complex world (such as shifting global discourse on the genocide of the Rohingya), and who provide important pastoral support for students who continue to suffer from a mental health crisis. It illustrated an utter contempt for our students, too; our working conditions are our students’ learning conditions. We had all had enough.Of course, it didn’t have to be like this. The economic arguments for slashing our pensions have vanished, with the Universities Superannuation Scheme pension fund now exceeding pre-pandemic levels. The higher education sector is running around a £40bn surplus and it would take only a small percentage of that to satisfy inflation-level pay rises. Instead, university managers have flailed and floundered, creating more and more anxiety and misery among the very people who make the institution and the students it claims to care about. At my university, several colleagues have left as a result, with management’s attempt to push students to “snitch” on colleagues if they cancelled classes as a result of strike action the last straw for some.The cost-of-living crisis will force students to choose between studying and eating | Chelsie HenshawRead moreBut we are moving them. The experience on the picket lines is always a pleasure. It is an opportunity to spend time with colleagues, and very often students, outside the classroom. We talk about the dispute, yes, but we also talk about what we got up to at the weekend, which restaurant we ate at the other night, Manchester United’s meteoric rise up the table, or our colleague’s daughter’s first steps. There is music, food, banner painting, chalking on the pavements, all set against a cacophony of car horns beeping in support. And February’s statement by Universities UK, which represents our employers, and the University and College Union, suggesting that pensions could be improved, shows that solutions can be found if the will is there.I love working at Queen Mary University of London. My colleagues are publishing some of the most exciting research and working with the most important charities and social movements across the world. My students come from across the globe, and some have gone on to be fearless lawyers representing marginalised and vulnerable people, or courageous activists fighting police brutality and climate breakdown. They continue to remind me what a privilege it is to teach them. I want to preserve all this for my colleagues and students, but also for the next generation of would-be academics and curious minds. This is not just a dispute on the state of the sector, but a test about how much we really invest in the idea of teaching and research as a public good.

For some of my patients, it means a scramble to organise emergency childcare. Others miss the window to access the best treatments for strokes or heart attacks.The waiting room is a hotbed of emotion. My patients are understandably furious that they’ve been left in a windowless waiting room for hours with limited food and water, inadequate pain relief and little information about when they might be seen (aside from the hourly PA announcement that the current wait time is 15 hours and is expected to increase).This is the backdrop to me joining the junior doctors’ strike today. NHS managers could have reduced waiting times by increasing our pay, encouraging more doctors and nurses into the sector. Instead, security guards are stationed in A&E to deal with patients’ rising anger.For me, a turning point in supporting a strike was seeing workers in other trade unions win fair pay deals through taking industrial action – it has inspired many healthcare workers.Since 2008 our pay has been cut by 26%. By the government’s own calculations, it would cost £28bn to raise every public sector worker’s wage in line with inflation. That’s £28bn that could have been invested in improving our struggling public services, but they have only gotten worse. Falling wages inevitably lead to falling standards of care.At medical school we learned how to provide the highest quality medical care, but it’s now rare that I find myself in a position where I can give it. My time at work is occupied with navigating almost impenetrable bureaucratic systems, or dealing with frustratingly banal yet essential tasks, such as finding a working label printer to send off blood samples.I was in the first cohort of students to pay £9,000 tuition fees, and as a result I graduated from university with more than £46,000 of debt. The first year I started working, my total debt went up as my salary wasn’t high enough to pay off the interest that my student loan was accruing. I expected that, after a year or two, I would be earning enough to be able to start paying off the debt, but even this year, after five years of working as a doctor, my salary is still too low to even cover the interest. No wonder many of my colleagues feel they have no option but to pick up extra shifts on their weekends and rest days, on top of the 48 hours a week that we already work, in order to achieve a decent quality of life.In the past, high workloads were tolerated with the promise of a stable career and good pay progression, but this is no longer the reality. Almost all of my junior doctor colleagues are on fixed-term or zero-hours contracts. Competition ratios for medical training posts are often in excess of five applicants for every post, and even for a traditionally less competitive specialty such as general practice, there are more than twice as many applicants as there are posts available. For some trust grade posts, which come with no training, no pay progression and no stability, there are 10 doctors applying for every post.The hospital seems to run more like a factory. Medical decisions, such as how to look after someone with abdominal pain, are reduced to algorithms and tick boxes, leaving little flexibility for the huge variety of patients we see. We’re moved to different wards each day, leaving no continuity of care for patients. Doctors are often forced to shoulder personal responsibility for the long waits and understaffing, being asked to churn through patients, ideally discharging them as quickly as possible.Medical students urged to fill gaps when junior doctors strike in EnglandRead moreDoctors, it seems, are seen as costs to be minimised. Apparently, those who treat patients the fastest are considered better “value for money”. To stand any chance of getting a permanent post we seem to have to be willing to stay late to complete audits and teach in our free time. Medical students are now expected to clock-in and clock-out of placement each day. I feel it is only a matter of time until the same processes are inflicted on doctors too.Many of my colleagues have moved to Australia, where pay and conditions are better, or quit medicine altogether, and I can understand why. But I enjoy being a doctor. When the system works well, it’s brilliant. Whether deploying the latest pharmacological discovery or simply giving age-old antibiotics and intravenous fluids, doctors, nurses and other healthcare workers really can improve lives. I doubt I will ever quit medicine, but I can’t continue to work as things are.There is now an atmosphere of camaraderie sweeping through hospitals. From doctors to nurses, cleaners to secretaries, we’re all getting active in our unions and preparing to win back our pay. This shouldn’t be a hard decision for the government: just give us what we are owed so we can go back to work. Until then, I’ll be on the picket lines.

Told off for leaning. Monitored for each package completed. As a worker at Amazon, I often feel that we aren’t being treated as people.But for me, the moment I knew we needed to go on strike was when we were told we’d be getting a pay rise of just 50p extra an hour. We came into work one day and the managers were holding briefings – telling us that this was all we were going to get, and that we shouldn’t expect anything better. Just 50p extra, when we’re facing rising prices in every shop and energy bills going through the roof. The company describes the offer as “competitive pay”, pointing out that we get employee benefits on top of the hourly wage. Yet the company is making millions – if not billions – for the people at the top.Everyone who I work with at the warehouse in Coventry is frustrated. Frustrated at bad pay, at the long hours we have to work just to make ends meet, and at sky-high profits that we don’t see any benefit from. The shifts are hard work, spent all on our feet, walking miles back and forth through large warehouses. All of that for just £10.50 an hour. That’s why about 400 workers at our warehouse are striking today.We are treated worse than the robots doing automated tasks in the warehouses. If the robots have an issue, the company pays for them to be serviced, whereas if we drop below certain targets multiple times, we can be fired – we have to sort it out or get out. (The company says that its system “recognises great performance”, and that it offers “coaching” to employees who aren’t meeting targets.)Amazon workers on strike in Coventry on 25 January, 2023. Photograph: Henry Nicholls/ReutersIf you take too long to find a toilet in the huge warehouse, managers will ask you for account for this time – using doublespeak to describe it as being “idle”. Which other workplace would tolerate this? We are people, sometimes we need to use the toilet. How can this be a reasonable thing for a manager to ask about in a 21st-century workplace in Britain?And it isn’t as though Amazon is struggling for cash. In the UK last year, it made £204m in profit before tax. Its owner, Jeff Bezos, is one of the richest men on the planet, with enough money to fly to space.The company’s profits shot up during Covid. As the high street was closed, people relied on ordering things online. We were still in the back end of the warehouses working, and Bezos was still making money – even more money than before. From 2019 to 2020, profits nearly doubled to $21.3bn (£17.7bn) and rose again for 2021 to $33.4bn.Amazon union leader flies in to help UK strikers ‘kick down the door’Read moreAt the start of 2021, Amazon could have given every one of its workers across the world a £43,000 bonus out of the increase in profits, and Bezos would still have had more money than pre-pandemic.We were offered a 50p-an-hour increase in August. But with the cost of living soaring, inflation at 10.1% and conditions in the warehouses harder than ever, we are clear – a 4.8% pay rise isn’t good enough. We deserve a £15-an-hour wage. It isn’t as though Amazon can’t afford it. Amazon relies on its workers. Without us the business couldn’t run. But it refuses to talk to our union – it has not recognised it, and says that “a tiny proportion of our workforce is involved” in strikes. Yet at Coventry, more than a quarter of workers will be striking today.I see colleagues falling asleep on the bus to and from the depot. They are exhausted from the long hours, the physical nature of the job and the shift patterns they have to work to make ends meet. It can’t go on.

But now the situation is untenable. I cannot emphasise enough how dangerous things have become in 2023.Wards are so drastically understaffed that patient safety is at risk on a daily basis. I look after up to 12 patients on a shift. What that looks like in practice is managing 12 sets of medication, care plans and paperwork, updating 12 different families, and providing tailored care for 12 different people: signing forms for procedures, changing dressings, making sure they don’t become unwell, escalating concerns to the doctor. Making sure 12 different people are eating and drinking and using the toilet.I do this more or less single-handedly, because every other nurse and healthcare assistant on shift has 12 patients, too. The pressures we are facing are so inhumane that every single day I wonder if it will be the day that I’m going to make a mistake that costs someone their life.There was no lightbulb moment that pushed me towards strike action – it was more like death by a thousand cuts. I voted to take strike action last year without knowing if I would join the picket lines, but a recent shift convinced me it would be irresponsible not to stand alongside my colleagues. It was a busy day on the ward like any other; we were understaffed and fighting fires. As I looked down the corridor, I saw the only other nurse on shift – recently qualified, like me, with 12 patients on her list. We locked eyes and stood holding each other’s gaze for a second, both of us knowing we were drowning.At work, I’m somebody I no longer like very much. I focus on getting as much done as possible and freeing up beds. Patient-centred care is a distant memory. We are expected to be robots with no emotion. After a patient dies, within half an hour I am caring for somebody new in the same bed – there is simply no time for processing difficult days.Working with that level of anxiety and adrenaline for 12 hours on a weekly basis has consequences. At home I am emotionally and physically exhausted, with nothing left for my family. It is crushing knowing I am simply unable to give patients the standard of care they deserve, the standard of care I trained for. That’s not what I would want for myself, or my family members.There have been hard times before. During the pandemic, the fear on the ward was palpable. In March 2020, as the virus took hold, nurses cared for the dying without PPE. I remember wondering if I should say goodbye to my mum and dad. Since then, I have seen staff numbers nosedive and I can tell you why: our leaders, who once praised our superhuman efforts, seem to have amnesia. We are burned out and simply cannot continue. The health secretary tells us that if we do receive this pay award that we should be more productive. If I was any more productive, I’d be dead.Losing our art teacher was the final straw: I knew I had to strike for the sake of my students | James McAshRead moreIronically, taking action for me is not really about pay. I started in the NHS as a healthcare assistant after being a patient myself, and seeing the difference that nursing staff could make. I am immensely proud to work in nursing. But our current system sees patients as numbers, and nurses as cogs in the wheel. And it cannot continue. This dispute is about our dignity, and recognising our gruelling, daily service. I am striking because I want to see my profession respected. I am striking because if nurses continue to leave in their droves, who will be left to train the next cohort? I am striking because if we don’t see real changes, who will look after us when we are old?

Photograph: Luca Bruno/APOpinionDroughtThe Guardian view on water politics in Europe: a new fault lineEditorialAs drought beacomes the norm, creative solutions must be found to deal with a new, parched realityFri 26 May 2023 18.30 BSTLast modified on Fri 26 May 2023 19.11 BSTIn April, Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, suggested that severe drought would become “one of the central political and territorial debates of our country in the coming years”. That stark warning surely applies to southern Europe as a whole, as the prospect of another summer crisis looms, following a disastrously dry winter.An absence of melting snow from the Alps has left Italy’s Po River as shallow as during last year’s searingly hot summer. In January and February, France recorded the highest number of rain-free days since records began, and water restrictions are in place in the Pyrénées-Orientales region. About 90% of mainland Portugal is suffering from drought, judged to be severe in one-fifth of the country. In Spain, from Catalonia to Andalucía, unseasonable heat has contributed to reservoirs drying up and a disastrous drop in olive oil production. By the middle of this month, southern Spain had received barely 30% of expected rainfall. As temperatures continue to rise, and Europe warms faster than the global average, drought across vast swathes of territory is simply becoming the norm.There are obvious moves that can be made to alleviate water shortages. A quarter of drinking water in Europe is lost because of leaky pipelines. In Italy – one of the worst offenders in this respect – a drought taskforce has been created to improve water infrastructure. In France, Emmanuel Macron has set a 10% water savings target for all sectors of the economy by 2030 and demanded far greater reuse of wastewater. New, low-energy desalination techniques will be key to guaranteeing future supplies of water for human consumption.There is, however, no foreseeable technical fix that will allow difficult decisions over an increasingly scarce resource to be evaded. The politics of a new, parched reality will be fraught and contested, particularly in relation to food production in transformed terrain. In France, plans for new reservoirs to irrigate farmland have led to violent clashes between police and environmental protesters, who argue that agricultural practices need to become less water-intensive.In Andalucía, regional proposals to legalise irrigation in part of the Doñana Natural Space – one the world’s most important wetlands – have become a wedge issue ahead of local elections this weekend. Vox, a far-right party which has made political gains through downplaying the severity of the climate emergency, has positioned itself as a champion of the strawberry farmers who would benefit from the plans. In Seville, thousands have demonstrated against the project, which has been condemned by both Madrid and the European Commission.Global heating will eventually force rural economies such as those in Andalucía to diversify to survive. They will require substantial assistance from both national governments and the European Union to do so. More needs to be done to help those who find themselves at the sharp end of an emerging crisis for agricultural production. An absence of proper economic support will breed dangerous resentment in regions that have traditionally prided themselves on supplying Europe’s fruit, vegetable and cereal needs.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Photograph: Chip Somodevilla/Getty ImagesOpinionEconomic policyThe Guardian view on a death of consensus: politicians are having different nightmaresEditorialInterventions from the Tory chancellor and his Labour shadow spell the end of a period of economic agreement Fri 26 May 2023 18.25 BSTLast modified on Fri 26 May 2023 19.10 BSTDo political parties concur because they agree about their goals or their fears? Phil Tinline argues in his book The Death of Consensus that it is shared nightmares, not aspirations, that create unanimity in politics. This might explain why a new consensus seemed to form earlier this year – personified in the Economist by the character of Ms Heeves, a portmanteau of the Conservative chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, and his Labour shadow, Rachel Reeves.Both politicians were temperamentally unsuited to the radical policy experimentation of their parties under populist leadership. Neither would accept the characterisation that they agreed on much. But faced with an inflationary shock, both Mr Hunt and Ms Reeves retreated to a cosy consensus of sound money, pro-business policies. With an election likely next year, that period of agreement is ending. This is no bad thing.Ms Reeves this week laid out her political dividing lines in a speech and policy paper in Washington. She accurately pinpointed the original sin of austerity. Labour is right to argue that only an activist state can green the economy and dilute harmful corporate concentration. Creating an independent industrial strategy council – disbanded by the Tory government – on a statutory footing is a good idea incubated by the Institute for Public Policy Research. Stronger “collective bargaining rights” to deal with economic insecurity and low pay are also welcome. This is territory that the Tories can only occupy with empty rhetoric.Mr Hunt, by contrast, laid out a Panglossian vision of the UK’s economic success in the pages of the Telegraph last Friday. It is true that Britain, according to the Bank of England, will avoid a recession this year and that the country’s growth prospects have improved. But the Telegraph’s online readers appeared less than impressed – with many seeing Mr Hunt as much a high tax and interventionist politician as his shadow. The chancellor’s sunny take is an attempt to shift that view.Tory voters tell pollsters that the economy is the most important issue facing the country, followed by immigration and then inflation. They seem more convinced than the rest of the country that the prime minister will keep his promise to cut inflation by half. Though it is coming down, the cost of living crisis remains persistent, with grocery prices jumping 19%. But this may not trouble the wealthy Tory base. Owning their homes outright means they are also insulated from the painful medicine of higher interest rates prescribed by the Bank of England, and endorsed by Mr Hunt, to bring the rate of price increases down. A core Conservative vote sees a prize in lower inflation: fiscal space for Mr Hunt to offer them a pre-election giveaway – such as cutting inheritance tax.The Tories and Labour now have different nightmares. The latter’s voters worry that the challenge of inequality remains unspoken. The gains from globalisation-enabled growth were not broadly shared. Not only did regions lose out, but so did lower income groups. No other major European country is as unequal as Britain. The Resolution Foundation calculates that, by one measure of income inequality, the Gini coefficient, Britain in 2027 would be more unequal than the US today. Under Ms Reeves’s fiscal rules, that dismal future could be avoided by levying wealth taxes – and using the money raised to repair public services. Unfortunately, the parameters of political debate remain firmly set to avoid saying this out loud. That must change.TopicsEconomic policyOpinionJeremy HuntRachel ReevesUK cost of living crisisInequalityTax and spendingeditorialsReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedThe Guardian viewColumnistsCartoonsOpinion videosLettersNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The Tory party is out of touch with the moodThu 25 May 2023 18.42 BSTLast modified on Thu 25 May 2023 23.11 BSTNo government statistic showing an increase of 24% in a single year can be ignored. This will certainly not be the fate of the news from the Office for National Statistics on Thursday that net migration to the United Kingdom has risen from 488,000 in 2021 to 606,000 in 2022. The new figure is nearly double the 2018 level, which itself led the Conservative party to pledge, in its 2019 general election manifesto, that net migration would be reduced during the current parliament.As a broken pledge and a policy failure this takes some beating. But it is par for the course. The 2019 pledge is one of a series of unrealisable and often cruelly deceitful migration promises made by the Conservatives in the past 20 years. Rishi Sunak’s focus on the Channel small boats and Thursday’s repeated pledge to bring the numbers down shows how little has changed.These pledges are aimed at and reflect the Tory party more than the country. They pander to the mistaken view that migration to Britain is uniquely high. All recycle the mischievous simplicity that migration can be purged from an interconnected world. All are fired by the misplaced belief that migration is invariably opposed by the public in the way some newspapers and politicians pretend.In fact, as the 2022 figures show, none of this is true. For one thing, the new total reflects very specific factors. These include an estimated 114,000 arrivals in the UK under the Ukraine sponsorship and family visa schemes, for which public support is generous and high. They also include 52,000 long-term arrivals from Hong Kong of people with British nationals overseas status, whose presence is similarly accepted by most people in the UK.It would be wrong, though, to depict the 2022 figure as an outlier. Migration is a dynamic and enduring reality of the modern world. It is likely to remain high, not to decline significantly. There are multiple push causes for this, including poverty and the climate crisis, that are likely to be recurrent. There are also multiple pull factors, including the ageing populations of many European nations, including Britain, and the consequent demand for labour across a range of economic sectors. These are not going to disappear either.The pragmatism of the public mood is ahead of Conservative MPs on this issue. The majority has increasingly accepted and welcomed these realities, provided the immigration system is felt, against considerable evidence, to be competent. In an under-appreciated shift, the public now says, by a majority, that migration levels should stay the same or increase. This is largely because so many of those who migrate here legally for work come to do jobs of which the public strongly approves. Nurses, doctors, care workers, computer programmers, business people, scientists and accountants made up the bulk of those to whom visas were awarded last year. But people now also favour migration for fruit and vegetable picking, construction and of university students. The public gets it in ways the government doesn’t.None of this means that there is no need to debate immigration policy. While parts of the Tory party embrace the aggressive racial divisiveness of the Trump era in the United States, there are signs that most British people want a more decent approach. The immigration debate needs to be fact-based, rational and sensitive. Pretending that the issue will fade away, though, is dangerous. It won’t and it shouldn’t.TopicsImmigration and asylumOpinionConservativesMigrationRishi SunakeditorialsReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedThe Guardian viewColumnistsCartoonsOpinion videosLettersNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The country’s future cannot be safeguarded by strongmenThu 25 May 2023 18.41 BSTLast modified on Thu 25 May 2023 21.41 BSTWhen foreign diplomats fled Sudan as fighting engulfed Khartoum, some denied Sudanese civilians the means to follow them to safety. American and French staff shredded passports handed in by those seeking visas, to ensure they did not fall into the wrong hands. Others simply left them locked inside abandoned embassies.This speaks to the disregard shown to those caught up in the struggle between two generals: Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, Sudan’s army chief and de facto leader, and Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti, who commands the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces. The fighting is not only trashing hospitals, markets and homes. The political analyst Kholood Kair says the conflict has “completely annihilate[d] Sudanese political, social and economic life”. The UN expert for human rights in Sudan, Radhouane Nouicer, warned on Tuesday: “This is the destruction of a country in a way that is dehumanising its people.” More than 850 civilians have been killed, thousands injured and hundreds of thousands displaced since violence erupted in mid-April.The latest patchy, fragile ceasefire has begun, following a deal brokered by Washington and Riyadh. But expectations are at rock bottom. Both sides remain aggressive; neither has gained a decisive advantage and previous ceasefires have been partially honoured, if at all. While the situation in Khartoum has commanded the most attention, there are concerns that the conflict in Darfur is already broadening. The longer the war drags on, the greater the risk that more people will be drawn into this conflict: other domestic armed groups, civilians who begin to see no other way of defending their communities, and regional players pursuing their own interests. The intense violence could escalate into a fully fledged civil war fuelled by external powers – and even harder to resolve.Not only are civilians suffering from indiscriminate attacks, but civil society activists are being targeted by people on both sides. That is, perhaps, hardly surprising, when the generals were previously united in preventing a transition to civilian government. Those whom the country most needs are being detained, killed or forced to flee.This conflict has already demonstrated that counting on military strongmen for stability is a grotesque error. Saudi Arabia, which has ties to both leaders but is regarded as broadly neutral, has been key in bringing them to the table and reaching this ceasefire agreement. No one imagines it will see the return to democracy as an important goal, however. Senior White House engagement and the appointment of a special envoy could help stabilise the situation and should also press for civilian involvement in the longer term. The African Union has so far played a limited role, in part because the two generals have not welcomed its involvement. Its attempt to convene a political process involving civilians is welcome and necessary, but integrating that with the military talks will be extremely difficult, and there is a danger of it being relegated to secondary status. For now, merely stopping the fighting is an immense challenge.More than half of Sudan’s population needs humanitarian aid. Over 300,000 civilians have fled to neighbouring countries, where many are extremely vulnerable. While the UN has launched a $3bn appeal for help, the UK has just slashed funding to east Africa. As many feared, the international spotlight has swung away from this violence following the evacuation of foreigners. But Sudanese civilians must not be treated as an afterthought.TopicsSudanOpinionAfricaUnited NationsMiddle East and north AfricacommentReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Now Europe’s task is to ensure that Moldova’s democracy survivesWed 24 May 2023 16.16 BSTLast modified on Thu 25 May 2023 10.22 BSTWhile Russia’s war on Ukraine rages on and Kyiv prepares its counteroffensive, Moldova, the former Soviet republic sandwiched between Ukraine and the EU, is fortunate to be still standing. Had Russia succeeded in its original war aims, not only would it have captured Kyiv and Odesa, but from there it would have been a matter of days before Russian forces had reached Chisinau.Moldovan authorities have no doubt this was Vladimir Putin’s plan. The prime minister, Dorin Recean, is crystal clear: Moldova survives only thanks to Ukrainian resistance. If Moscow had been able to spread the war to Moldova, there is no way it would have been able to put up the kind of fight the Ukrainian armed forces have. Yet, as far as the future of democracy, international law and European security are concerned, Moldova’s fate is as important as Ukraine’s.The war fought militarily on Ukrainian soil still reaches deep into Moldova: disinformation, cyber-attacks, the destabilisation efforts of a Moscow-backed opposition and a separatist enclave loyal to Russia are only some of the existential threats that its 2.6 million people are dealing with.Yet, considering how things could have turned out, I returned from a recent trip to Moldova and Ukraine (organised by the Vienna Institute for Human Sciences) with an incredible sense of hope.A consequence of the invasion, certainly unintended by the Kremlin, is that Moldova has been recognised as a candidate for EU membership. Moldova’s president Maia Sandu’s pro-European and reformist credentials were important in this achievement. Sandu has made it her goal to take Moldova into the EU by 2030.But in western Europe, too, there has been an attitude shift: even governments traditionally sceptical about EU enlargement, such as the French, have, at least for the time being, embraced Moldova’s path to European integration.Only a year ago, Moldova relied on Russia for 100% of its natural gas imports. Now, that figure is down to 0%. Energy prices remain unaffordably high for many Moldovans, but it is no longer a security threat. Moldova’s electricity still comes from Transnistria, a Moldovan region which broke away in 1992 and is now controlled by Russian-backed separatists.But if Russia were to cut gas supplies, causing electricity generation to grind to a halt, it would trigger an economic collapse in Transnistria rather than a protracted blackout in Moldova. Moldova and Ukraine have synchronised their grids with the EU’s and built interconnections with neighbouring Romania. Without electricity powered by Russian gas, Moldova would temporarily struggle, but it would survive.And Russia knows it. It also knows that its invasion of Ukraine has upended Transnistria’s economy, casting doubt over this puppet region’s political future. Transnistria survives on the electricity it sells to Moldova, powered by Russian gas that it gets for free. Russia maintains a massive ammunition depot and a 1,500-strong military force in Transnistria, but only about 70 of these soldiers are actually Russian. The rest are Transnistrians with dual Moldovan and Russian passports: for most, their role in Russian forces is just a job.‘Moldovans have a government determined to make the best of its difficult predicament.’ Maia Sandu, the president of Moldova, at a pro-EU rally, Chisinau, 21 May 2023. Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty ImagesWhy, then, does Moldova not seek to regain control of its territory? Over dinner in Chisinau, Nicu Popescu, Moldova’s foreign minister and an old friend of mine, explained the predicament.The answer is counterintuitive yet logical. Why accelerate a political process that would distract Moldova from its EU reform path, while possibly triggering a Russian-backed coup or overt military response? Chisinau wants the eventual reintegration of Transnistria, but wants it to happen through the Moldovisation of Transnistria, not the other way around.All that said, Moldova’s security situation remains precarious, with a tiny and underequipped army facing a persistent Russian threat. The country’s economic challenge is almost as daunting. Lacking a strong industrial base, Moldova does not have an obvious path out of its unwanted ranking as Europe’s poorest country. Even before the war, with an energy crisis that caused inflation to soar, annual income per head averaged at less than $4,000, compared with the EU average of $33,000. The cost of living crisis explains Sandu’s waning popularity and could still bring her down in elections next year.But for now, Moldovans have a government determined to make the best of its difficult predicament. There is no lack of will to deliver democratic reforms such as fighting corruption. Russian meddling and disinformation may be leveraging the very real economic hardship to whip up anti-government sentiment, but public support for EU membership is strong: thousands turned out for a pro-EU rally this week.What is lacking is capacity. Huge numbers of Moldovans of working age have left the country and, while some of the best and brightest do return, it requires a massive act of passion and commitment: a minister in Moldova earns less than a junior researcher at my institute (who, alas, is not well paid). Several of the people we met had given up comfortable jobs abroad to serve their country; I was in awe of their stories, yet saw how difficult it is to harness sufficient talent to lead the country to a brighter future.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to This is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pivotal stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

When I asked Sandu’s foreign policy adviser what the dream outcome was, the answer was simple and compelling: demonstrating to our citizens (and to the Kremlin) that we’re not alone.In Moldova, the mood is realistic, yet hopeful. Ukraine’s resistance has secured Moldova’s existence, and Moldovans are now sowing the seeds for their European future.As I think back to that hope I sensed in Chisinau, my mind drifts to Odesa, which is just 200km away and which I was able to visit a few days later. The Ukrainian Black Sea port is a long way from the frontline, yet it bears the outward signs of a country at war. The streets are emptier than Chisinau’s and I spotted buildings damaged by a Russian drone attack. There is a nighttime curfew but security measures have been eased and an extended grain deal means Odesa’s docks, strangled for months by a Russian naval blockade, are working again. As in Moldova, there is a mood of cautious optimism.In between meetings, I sneaked away to visit the family of Olga, a Ukrainian refugee who lived with me last year. Olga and her son Vlad are still in Rome, but her mother and grandma stayed in Ukraine. They look after Olga’s garden now, which I had heard so much about from her. When I video-called Olga that day, I wanted her to see it: the cherry tree was in bloom.

They’re terrified of their own ‘Portillo moment’Henry HillHumiliation on election night isn’t exactly a tantalising prospect, but so many retirements aren’t the best thing for parliamentWed 24 May 2023 13.25 BSTLast modified on Wed 24 May 2023 17.07 BSTWhen Rishi Sunak accepted Dominic Raab’s resignation back in April, the prime minister seemed to leave open the possibility of Raab’s return to frontline politics. As a longstanding ally of Sunak, it seemed plausible enough that the outgoing justice secretary might return to government at a future reshuffle, penance paid. Perhaps he would even get his old job back, and call the British bill of rights back from the grave for a third time.We will never know. This week, Raab announced that he intends to stand down as a member of parliament at the next election. He is not yet 50, and has been an MP for just 13 years.Explaining this doesn’t take any more detective work than an online search for his constituency. In 2015, the Conservative majority in Esher and Walton was 28,616; in 2017, a still hearty 23,298. In 2019? Just 2,743. Over the past year, the Tories’ polling collapse has led some to wonder whether all the talk of a post-Brexit realignment was overstated. But it is seats such as this that suggest they are wrong.The last time Esher and Walton or any of the constituency’s predecessors returned a non-Tory MP was when a Liberal scraped home in Chertsey by 99 votes … in 1906. Ian Taylor, Raab’s predecessor, held this seat for the Tories by more than 14,500 votes in 1997.A seat such as this suddenly becoming marginal while Boris Johnson was securing the first comfortable Conservative majority since 1987 is exactly what a realignment looks like. It would have taken remarkable reserves of public spiritedness for Raab to fight on, just for the sake of providing my generation with our “Portillo moment”.But the announcement of his departure means there is now a vacancy for the unenviable role of the person widely expected to be convincingly defeated in 2024. Liberal Democrat activists are likely already working on a shortlist: “Where are you up for … ?”Will the prospect of such an ignominious place in the history books (and the extra attention from headhunting opponents) lead even more Tory MPs to join the 10% who have already decided to retire at the next election? It’s not the sort of thing people readily admit to, even in strictest confidence. But we can do a little rune-reading.Take Jacob Rees-Mogg, the man most often talked about after Raab as a potential election-defining scalp. His current majority is relatively healthy at almost 15,000 – and it went up, rather than down, at the last election. He has denied any suggestion that he is stepping down, and was unanimously readopted as the candidate.Yet he has also taken on a new job presenting a current affairs programme on GB News, from Monday to Thursday at 8pm. I provide the scheduling details not by way of advertisement, but to highlight how difficult it may be to combine such a role with his duties in the house (a fact that hasn’t escaped people at the channel, either).Then there’s Boris Johnson. Assuming he avoids suspension and a byelection, his majority in Uxbridge and South Ruislip is just 7,210 and it’s an unhappy time to be a Conservative in London. He has repeatedly denied suggestions that he will make a so-called rat run to a safer seat.We know Boris Johnson is a liar but Rishi Sunak promised truth and integrity. Where is it? | Peter OborneRead moreYet the rumours persist. And who can blame him? To lose his own seat just one election after winning a historic majority would be a personal disaster from which surely, even for him, no political recovery was possible – and irresistible red meat to the historians, too.Meanwhile, so divided is the Conservative party at this point that even some Tories are holding out for scalps. There will be many shots sunk by younger activists, for example, if Iain Duncan Smith and Theresa Villiers – both of whom hold London marginals and have worked very hard to kill the government’s attempt to build more houses – finally lose their battles against the inevitable next year.But perhaps trying to predict in advance who will furnish the Portillo moment defeats the object; the very power of the original was that it was a surprise, after all. It also distracts from the bigger, sadder story: it is not good for parliament to have such a high rate of churn among MPs.In the age of social media, the role can be deeply immiserating. Westminster life does put pressure on families and marriages – even more so now that MPs are forbidden from employing their spouses, which used to be a sensible safety valve.Setting aside my cynicism, we shouldn’t just dismiss Raab’s stated reason: he does have young children, and it can’t be easy having your dad being a hate figure. Parliament is the poorer for fewer former ministers and secretaries of state sticking around to offer their experience to the Commons – however you personally feel about Raab.

It just won’t doTue 23 May 2023 14.11 BSTLast modified on Tue 23 May 2023 17.25 BSTSpare a thought for the upper middle classes. Buying a private-school education in the UK used to be enough to get into Oxbridge or at the very least become prime minister, but the tide may be (slightly) turning. New research shows private-school pupils are up to a third more likely to get into Cambridge if they move to a state sixth form. Students who stayed at private schools for A-levels had an acceptance rate of 19% last year. But those who moved from a fee-paying school to a grammar school or sixth-form college had a success rate of about 25%. (Similar data from Oxford wasn’t available.)Iain Mansfield, head of education at Policy Exchange, told the Telegraph that the figures suggest universities are discriminating against fee-paying families. “This demonstrates why universities should be selecting on ability, not discriminating based on a child’s background.” If Iain’s mad now, wait until he hears about these things called private schools.This latest research reflects the wider trend of rising numbers of state-school pupils getting Oxbridge places in recent years. In 2022, the proportion of places offered to state-school students was 68% at Oxford and 72.5% at Cambridge; almost a decade earlier it was just 57% and 61% respectively. That’s definite progress. But it is less so when you consider that 83% of A-level students go to state schools.At the same time, influential jobs acquired post-uni are still monopolised by the fee-paying sector; those in politics, the judiciary, media and business are five times more likely to have been to private school than the general population. Simply put, a few less rich families are getting into Oxbridge, but are still dominating every aspect of society. When you’re used to being on top, equality – or even mild progress – feels a lot like oppression.Faced with this injustice, parents of private-school students are reportedly trying to “game the system” by registering under an obscure relative’s address in order to access a top-ranked state sixth form. The Times reported the case of “a capable but pony-loving teenage girl” who had been moved from her day school to a selective state school in a “tough neighbourhood” for her A-levels. “How on earth will she cope,” a family friend asked the paper. “How far are we willing to push social engineering, and at what mental cost?”It’s a good question. How far are we willing to push social engineering? Very far it seems, so long as the social engineering is tilted towards children who are born privileged. This is the galaxy brain of the British class system, where state school pupils getting opportunities is “discriminatory” but private-school alumni buying access to Oxbridge is “fairness”.While affluent parents can cry foul at the slightest encroachment of state-school children into elite institutions, the rest of the population is never allowed to object to the centuries-long dominance of private schools. Just look at how the rightwing press spins any debate about the issue as “the politics of envy”. Private-school advantage is so embedded in this country that even the mildest attempt to balance the scales is greeted with hysteria.Well done, Keir Starmer, for taking on private schools’ tax breaks – but you can go further | Frances RyanRead moreAs we head towards the general election, expect this hysteria to ratchet up to Defcon 1. There are fears that if Labour gets into power and removes charitable tax breaks from private schools, some parents will no longer be able to afford the already inflation-hiked fees – and will have to put their children into the state sector instead. As one mother told the i paper last week, she is “sick and nervous” at the thought. We all have our fears. Mine is a clown that when it turns around is actually Michael Gove. But at a time when more and more parents lie awake at night worrying how to feed their children, it would not be unreasonable to suggest that public money should not be spent subsidising those whose biggest concern is sending their offspring to the local comp.And yet even such a minor policy change is met with resistance, often on the grounds that it would punish ordinary people who “scrimp and save” for private school fees, as if a nurse would be able to afford St Paul’s for her sons if it wasn’t for that pesky VAT rate. The reality, of course, is that rather than ever being in reach of the average family, private schools are a bastion of the elite – and that’s exactly the point of them.If the very establishments that symbolise – and perpetuate – elitism are open to the masses, the purpose of the private-school system starts to unravel. The pushback from wealthy families losing their hold on Oxbridge places is simple: certain families want to gatekeep their power.

What can we learn from it?Marina PrentoulisThe Syriza party did worse than most thought possible, despite a series of prime ministerial scandals and widespread povertyMon 22 May 2023 13.54 BSTLast modified on Mon 22 May 2023 17.55 BSTGreece’s election results were a big surprise for the winners, the losers and the pollsters. In a country where huge numbers of people are struggling every day, with almost a third of the population estimated to be at risk of poverty, the prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis’s rightwing New Democracy party managed to secure 40% of the vote – a remarkable victory that no polling agency predicted.The runner-up was the former prime minister Alexis Tsipras of the centre-left Syriza party, best known for its turbulent confrontation with the EU’s economic centres of power in 2015. He picked up only 20% of the vote, much lower than the pollsters had predicted and lower than most Greeks – friends and enemies of Syriza alike – thought possible. The lack of an outright majority for New Democracy makes the most plausible scenario a second election in June or early July – this round is designed to give bonus seats to the winner, increasing its chances of securing a majority.European economy expected to grow faster than forecast, says EURead moreNew Democracy’s victory was not unexpected, but the eye-watering share of the vote the party received is a different matter. The conservative government often points to its record of growth and investment, backed by European Commission forecasts, but the proceeds of this have not been felt evenly: a growing number of Greece’s population over the same period have dealt with low wages, low pensions, high rents and a painful cost of living crisis. The disparity between what is on paper and the bleak reality on the ground is striking. So why are the conservatives still out in front, with an outright majority within their grasp? It seems the promises of stability, growth and impenetrable borders have paid off.But there is also the question of the sorry state of the opposition. For Syriza, the high of the 2015 electoral triumph at the peak of the eurozone’s financial crisis was quickly tempered by the imposition of loans from Greece’s creditors that demanded huge sacrifices by the Greek people in order to control the country’s spiralling debt. The return of New Democracy to power in 2019 made clear the extent of disillusionment and hopelessness that Syriza’s base felt after voting against a bailout in a referendum – and then watching their government accept one.Since then the party leadership’s strategy has been to return to the centre ground to attract more moderate voters – and it has failed spectacularly. On top of that, the absence of any sign of contrition or self-reflection for the years Syriza was in government further alienated its electoral base.Whatever form the next government takes, the structural problems that Greece faces remain profound. Corruption is rife. A series of scandals – such as a phone-tapping scandal that has been dubbed the Greek Watergate – have stained the Mitsotakis premiership and speak loudly to the failure of the country’s institutions. New Democracy – and the social democratic Pasok party, with which it alternated in government from 1974 to 2015 – cannot escape responsibility for this long-term deterioration.Take the outrage over the Tempe railway tragedy in February, when the collision of two trains left 57 dead. The disaster led to protests and was raised by opposition parties during the election as a sign of the country’s administrative dysfunction: many believe it could have been avoided had the rail network not been so neglected.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to This is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pivotal stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Only last week, footage was revealed that appeared to show 12 asylum seekers who had arrived at Lesbos being forcibly transferred to a Greek coastguard vessel and then abandoned in an inflatable boat in the middle of the sea. The rightwing government has dismissed allegations of being involved in the pushback of asylum seekers, but the video evidence and testimonies leave little doubt as to Greece’s infringements of European rules and international law. Nonetheless, it is partly this draconian treatment of migrants that has helped New Democracy shore up electoral support.Another story of the night is the slow recovery of Pasok. Once a force for change in the post-junta period, it picked up a respectable 11%, confirming an upwards trajectory after its near-fatal low of less than 5% in 2015. One factor behind this is that its leader, Nikos Androulakis, is an MEP and, as such, is not directly involved in Greek parliamentary shenanigans. In fact, Androulakis is even a victim of the Greek state itself – last year it was revealed that his phone had been tapped by Greece’s intelligence services. (Mitsotakis denied knowing about this and said it was wrong.)Maybe these results will be a wake-up call for Greece’s progressive parties as to the importance of collaborating with each other. To get anywhere close to winning office, however, they will have to learn to offer something more than just being a way of avoiding the worst-case scenario.

Now I feel I’m doing something usefulMon 22 May 2023 08.00 BSTLast modified on Mon 22 May 2023 10.25 BSTMy clown-white facepaint makes my skin feel tight and I’m scared my elaborate headdress is going to slip. It’s my first outing with the Red Rebel Brigade, the silent climate activist performance group. About a dozen of us are clad in robes, veils and evening gloves – all a bright blood-red. We glide to our local Barclays bank to stand in a tableau of grief. We are meant to aim for the faraway stare of “a watcher through the ages”, but I’m afraid I look more like someone stuck in a slow queue at Sainsbury’s. I suddenly catch the eye of someone I know as they walk past, staring at me like I’m bonkers. But I’ve tried the sensible ways of doing something about the climate crisis. I’ve written letters to politicians, carried placards and had endless conversations. At best, I just put people’s backs up. So I’ve decided to shut up and wrap myself in a red sheet instead.Two years before this, on the morning of 9 September 2020, I woke in my home in Berkeley, California, to a Plutonian twilight. Smoke from the latest wildfire had mixed with the fog in a blanket that shorter wavelengths of light couldn’t penetrate. I tried to explain away the darkness to my kids but I felt like a parent in biblical Egypt, claiming everything was fine while frogs rained from the sky. My husband and I had worried about California’s escalating drought and wildfires for years, but after Orange Skies Day we decided we’d had enough. Time to move back to my native UK. (Unlike millions displaced by the climate crisis, we were privileged to have this option.)Once we got here, people wondered why on earth we’d leave sunny California. I told the truth: “Because of the climate apocalypse.” After politely ascertaining that wildfires hadn’t actually burned our house down, people couldn’t change the topic fast enough. But I didn’t take the hint. Since nearly everything we do has a carbon cost, every conversation led to the climate crisis. When my parents posted pictures of themselves basking in the Spanish heatwave on the family WhatsApp chat, I responded: “The world’s getting hotter fast. Who wants to join me at the next climate protest?” Awkward silence ensued. In his book Don’t Even Think About It, about why we ignore climate breakdown, George Marshall says that when he brings it up “the words collapse, sink and die in mid-air, and the conversation suddenly changes course. It is like an invisible force field.” Yep.A wildfire in Oroville, California, 9 September 2020. Photograph: Josh Edelson/AFP/Getty ImagesI joined my local Extinction Rebellion group and they told me the best way to start conversations about climate was not to talk, but to listen. After that, instead of telling people how worried I was, I asked if they were worried. “Yes, but I recycle,” said a neighbour at a picnic. “Can I have your tart recipe?” That night, while doom-scrolling, I saw a picture of the Red Rebels and felt an instant connection: here were people who didn’t downplay their climate grief for the sake of others. They flaunted it. At last, here was an outlet for my climate emotions.At my first outing as a Red, I expect to feel anxious and exposed, but it’s unexpectedly restorative. I can’t answer texts during our performances, and my kids can’t ask me for snacks. Passersby follow us and even want to strike up conversations. But I just raise my hands as if holding an invisible chalice, my go-to pose. I’m blissfully silent. It’s relaxing to be the one exerting the invisible force field.I’ve been in the grip of astrology all my life, so why am I turning my back on the stars? | Daisy JonesRead moreA week later, at a barbecue, something amazing happens: I don’t feel the urge to tell everyone about plant-based burgers, but just enjoy myself instead. And when I go to see my sister’s new kitchen extension I don’t ask about its carbon footprint, but admire her stylish skylights. I no longer feel the need to rant about the climate in daily interaction. I’m less angry with other people because I’m less angry with myself. I feel as if I’m doing something useful.But in April, I have a moment of doubt. I join more than 70 Reds as part of Extinction Rebellion’s protest weekend in London, and afterwards, looking at all the photos, I ask myself: is this just about looking amazing? But then I remember the wonder on onlookers’ faces. Some cry. Some call us “spawn of Satan” or shout about “climate conspiracy”, but we always inspire big emotions.I hope the emotion that people tap into will drive them to act. Other forms of activism are valuable, but as a Red, I can see the effect I’m having on people’s faces. Talking to people about the climate crisis made me feel hopeless. Striking a mute pose of despair? Remarkably uplifting.

Photograph: Jae C Hong/APOpinionBuzzFeedVice and BuzzFeed were meant to be the future of news. What happened?Jane MartinsonTheir young audience made them the envy of the media’s old guard. But, ultimately, they couldn’t convert this into profitSat 20 May 2023 08.00 BSTLast modified on Sat 20 May 2023 15.50 BSTAfter Rupert Murdoch invested tens of millions of pounds in his digital publishing company in 2013, Shane Smith, boss of Vice Media, laughed at how much old media companies wanted his sexy young business. Acknowledging that they were being left behind, they would offer billions: “And we keep saying ‘no, no, no’”.Soon afterwards, BuzzFeed’s Jonah Peretti, Smith’s closest rival for the attentions of both young eyeballs and wealthy older men, was in London to talk about plans for his own global domination. There is over-preoccupation with the money he said. He tried to avoid that, because, “then we’re not thinking about what the company is doing but what it’s worth”.But now everyone is thinking about what Vice Media and BuzzFeed are worth; earlier this week Vice filed for bankruptcy protection, just a few weeks after BuzzFeed closed a news operation that once sought to rival the biggest names in news. Both digital media companies – once hailed as the future for news – are now worth a fraction of their one-time highs. Vice, valued at nearly $6bn soon after Murdoch invested, is expected to be bought for about $225m by its remaining lenders.The reason for these sudden declines, occurring almost in tandem, is relatively simple, albeit still heartbreaking for all those who now face unemployment. Vice burned through all the money investors splashed on it and still had so much outstanding debt – $834m – that rising interest rates made its future unsustainable. Prizes and awards did not stop BuzzFeed struggling to make enough money.What went wrong was not just a worsening economic climate, hubris and mismanagement, but also a payment system in which these two very different digital media darlings were set up to fail.‘Like Icarus – now everyone is burnt’: how Vice and BuzzFeed fell to earthRead moreRemind yourself how different they were: Vice, spawned from a punk magazine until the internet gave it global reach, sent a basketball star to meet the leader of North Korea, Kim Jong-un. BuzzFeed, meanwhile, founded by a liberal Californian, wanted to be the New York Times of the web with a sideline in cat videos.Both were fed by the idea that audience reach was all, and that digital advertising would be enough to pay for all the content being consumed by a generation groomed on the need for constant updates, or “hot takes” as Peretti called them. Social media companies born on the web sneered at the old media groups with their dirty print costs, and offered a link to younger readers who no longer read papers or watched TV. The fact that half of 18- to 34-year-old Americans came to Buzzfeed.com every month, according to Google Analytics research, made a loss-making site appear to be the future, despite the fact that those users failed to spend any money there. When they grew tired of the advertising that kept stopping their content, even the cat videos, the advertisers moved elsewhere.The idea of youth as not just the future but the panacea was evident as long ago as 2014 when I visited Vice’s then achingly hip London base in Shoreditch. When Comscore figures suggested that the Guardian and other legacy media brands attracted more millennials than Vice.com, the company called the analysis “inaccurate”. More tellingly, senior advertisers said the fact that it was largely millennials who visited Vice, while lots of older people favoured legacy media, was more important.Joseph Teasdale, head of technology at Enders Analysis, says some of the problems faced by the digital darlings during that formative time (the terrible technological teen years) were that they remained “good pitches still looking for a business plan”. Investors will happily splurge cash on the hope of future success, but only for a finite amount of time.It is also clear that social media platforms such as Facebook and Google proved unreliable sources of funding. Without any real sanction, Facebook could simply switch its algorithm to stop promoting news stories, while Google had to be persuaded of the distinction and value of editorial versus advertising. Both BuzzFeed and Vice were among the first to grapple with and then be criticised for their own handling of this distinction. Meanwhile, Gen Z had moved on, its diminishing attention span now fixed on even shorter video content on Snapchat and TikTok.Investors with money to spend are still willing to back new ventures offering information and news to the next generation, including one launched by Smith in the US and two in London, Tortoise and the News Movement. Earlier this month, the Messenger launched in the US with $50m and a founder, Jimmy Finkelstein, who wants an alternative to a too-partisan national news media.While Vice and BuzzFeed were trying and failing to develop their own business plans, legacy media companies had to develop new ways to make money as circulation and advertising revenues declined. Faced with increasingly loud voices online, for some that meant a move towards more partisan media. Or, “news for angry old people”, as Roman Roy in Succession describes ATN, the Fox-like news channel the fictional family still owns after killing off two Vice-like media ventures.If that’s all that is left after the money and tech men have finished experimenting with news online, then, young and old, we should all be angry.

Born into a village community displaced by Islamist violence, he and his family found refuge in an abandoned school near Ouagadougou, capital of Burkina Faso. Weakened by malnutrition and anaemia, Abdoulaye, 3, contracted malaria. Despite frantic efforts to save him, he died, unremarked and unknown to the world at large.“Abdoulaye is doubly uncounted: as a displaced person and as a war death,” writes Stephanie Savell, a cultural anthropologist, recalling his brief life in a disturbing new report that reveals the vast, unacknowledged human costs of contemporary global warfare. “Though he is mourned by his family and his community, officially, he never existed. His story is emblematic of how this kind of death, and its omission in counts of the dead, happens in any number of conflicts.”Savell’s report, How Death Outlives War: The Reverberating Impact of the Post-9/11 Wars on Human Health, published by the Costs of War project at Brown University’s Watson Institute, focuses on what she terms “indirect deaths” – caused not by outright violence but by consequent, ensuing economic collapse, loss of livelihoods, food insecurity, destruction of public health services, environmental contamination and continuing trauma, including mental health problems, domestic and sexual abuse and displacement.Calculated this way, the total number of deaths that occurred as a result of post-9/11 warfare in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Libya and Somalia rises dramatically from an upper estimate of 937,000 to at least 4.5 million, of which up to 3.6 million were “indirect deaths”. Such deaths grow in scale over time. In Afghanistan, where the war ignited by the 2001 US-led invasion ended in 2021, the indirect death toll and related health problems are still rising.Levels of child malnutrition are indicators of the scale of war-related damageStephanie Savell, anthropologistExperts suggest “a reasonable, conservative average estimate for any contemporary conflict is a ratio of four indirect deaths for every one direct death”, Savell says. The poorer the population, the higher the resulting indirect mortality when conflict erupts. “Indirect deaths are devastating, not least because so many of them could be prevented, were it not for war,” she writes. Generally speaking, men are more likely to die in combat. Women and children are disproportionately affected indirectly.Savell does not attempt to apportion blame between various actors, although the US, which launched the “global war on terror” in 2001, bears heavy responsibility. She concedes that establishing definitive figures for war deaths of any kind is problematic and politically contested. Using the best available sources and data, her aim, she says, is to expand awareness of the fuller human costs of these wars and support calls for governments to alleviate continuing harms.“The mental health effects of war reverberate through generations, impacting parents and children, and then their children after that. Estimates [suggest] … anxiety and depression are two to four times greater among conflict-affected populations than the global average,” she writes. “Women tend to suffer [these effects] more acutely due to gender-based violence, which is heightened in wartime. In Iraq, rape and sexual violence increased sharply after 2003 [when the US and UK invaded] … Children are also particularly vulnerable. [Those] who experience high levels of collective violence are twice as likely to develop chronic diseases.”Levels of child malnutrition are indicators of the scale of war-related damage. “More than 7.6 million children under five are suffering from acute malnutrition, or wasting, in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, and Somalia,” the report estimates. “‘Wasting’ means not getting enough food, literally wasting to skin and bones, putting these children at greater risk of death, including from … weakened immune systems.”In Afghanistan specifically, where the economy has collapsed after the Taliban takeover, more than half the population now lives in extreme poverty. Tens of thousands of children under five are dying of preventable diseases such as cholera and measles, of acute malnutrition and neonatal complications. “As much as anyone killed by an airstrike or a gunshot wound, their deaths must be counted among the costs of war,” the report says.This scrupulously compiled examination of war’s unconsidered, long-term lethal impacts has great power to shock. In Pakistan, for example, between 2004 and 2010, the US conducted “double-tap” drone strikes, mostly on Pashtun villages in Waziristan, along the Afghan border, in which a second strike targeted people rushing to help victims of an initial bombing.“Reports document that residents of these regions suffered from PTSD, chronic anxiety and constant fear,” Savell writes. “A local resident explained: ‘God knows whether they’ll strike us again or not. But they’re always surveying us, they’re always over us, and you never know when they’re going to strike.’” Untreated, such trauma is debilitating and unceasing.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterArchie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morningPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Both direct and indirect deaths result. At one point in Syria’s civil war, according to a 2019 study quoted in the report, “each attack on a healthcare facility corresponded to an estimated 260 reported civilian casualties in the same month”, because of the resulting non-availability of medical assistance.Displacement is another big driver of indirect deaths, caused by physical insecurity, heightened mental stress, and abuse, exploitation and indifference suffered during attempted flights to safety. An estimated 38 million people have been displaced since 2001. Britain fought in many of these wars. As it debates tougher anti-migrant regulations, the UK must acknowledge its part in causing this crisis.The report details many additional, lingering deathtraps, including environmental contamination, unexploded ordnance, landmines, and damage to water, sanitation and aid and food distribution systems. More research data is badly needed, Savell writes, but it’s already evident governments must do more to mend what they broke – and that “reparations … are imperative”.Those who have died are beyond help. But for millions of adults and children still suffering the consequences of the post-9/11 conflicts, the need is urgent. They are condemned to war without end.

Its catastrophist discourse is at odds with the factsAlexander HurstMonths of anger have obscured reality and sapped resistance to the politics of nostalgiaMon 1 May 2023 13.34 BSTLast modified on Tue 2 May 2023 11.41 BSTThe French adventurer Sylvain Tesson may have put it best when he wrote: “France is a paradise inhabited by people who think they’re in hell.”The images from France over the past two months have seemed hellish enough – mounds of rubbish, sometimes on fire, serving as backdrop for violent clashes between some of the more extreme protest groups and body armour-clad riot police. Enough for my parents to repeatedly ask over FaceTime if it was really OK for me to be out and about in my neighbourhood, which borders a main protest square. (It was, I assured them each time, just France being France: the overaggressive nature of the confrontations and the dismissive and “arrogant” government response simply the self-fulfilling result of everyone assuming this was just how things would unfold.)Of course, France isn’t a literal paradise. It has had four decades of structurally high unemployment; a lost decade of stagnating incomes after the 2008-09 financial crisis; lower levels of social trust than its happier northern European neighbours (made worse by Emmanuel Macron’s use of article 49.3, which forced the legislature to choose between passing the unpopular retirement reform or holding new elections); a population shifting away from rural towns towards urban centres; and a slow, rolling recognition of its relative decline on the global stage.But there is an incredible disconnect between what tourists see, what foreigners living in France see, what French people living abroad see, what this recently naturalised français sees, and the hyperbolic, catastrophist nature of France’s own domestic discourse about itself (that is, the French people convinced their country has gone to hell).In this tale, France has been submerged by immigration and Islam, or by ultra-neoliberalism, or by authoritarianism (or some combination of these). This doesn’t correspond to measurable reality, but the stories we tell ourselves about ourselves are powerful.Several weeks ago I took a straw poll of my students – nothing statistically significant, but a snapshot of the general outlook of bright, politically aware first-years at Sciences Po, one of France’s most prestigious and globally high-ranking universities. I showed them a chart of inequality levels among Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) nations, but with the country names chopped off. They had no problem identifying where on the chart the US fell: nearly every hand went up to indicate that it had the highest inequality of any rich democracy.They were almost universally wrong when it came to accurately identifying France on the same chart. Nearly every student placed it just a few spots behind the US, easily in the top 25% of inequality. In truth, France’s position is  in the bottom portion of the chart, just shy of Denmark, Sweden, Finland and Norway.A TGV high-speed train at the Gare du Nord, Paris. Photograph: Eamonn McCabe/The GuardianIn fact, France’s Gini coefficient, the measure of inequality in a society, is lower today than it was during les trente glorieuses (1945 to 1975), when postwar France regained confidence by helping to pioneer first Concorde, then the TGV, and then in the early 1980s the proto-internet (the Minitel). After all, France devotes a higher percentage of its GDP to redistributing market inequalities than any of its wealthy peers – it even has an unparalleled income support and equalisation scheme for performing artists. As a result, it’s near the top globally for life expectancy, with its workers retiring earlier, on average, than anyone else in Europe (yes, even after the widely opposed reform), and with the lowest rate of poverty among older people.Unemployment – the perennial problem – is almost below 7%, a level that hasn’t been reached since before the 2008-09 financial crisis, partly due to the public investment made in promoting apprenticeships over the past two years. Intentions to hire are the highest they’ve been in 20 years, and in less than a decade France has gone from being woefully absent in the startup world to taking the continent’s crown for startup investment.When you adjust economic performance for climate footprint (which we should do for every country), France leads all of its peers. Whereas the US generates 0.28 tonnes of greenhouse gases to produce $1,000 of GDP, France does the same with only 0.14 tonnes of emissions. French per capita emissions are the absolute lowest of any large, wealthy country, and have been continually declining – down 25% from 2005 – while since 1990, France’s total forested area has increased by 7%.And France can still build big things. It has connected its major cities with the fastest trains in the world more cost effectively than China, and the Grand Paris Express (more than 200km of new metro track and 48 new stations) is being built for 20% of the per-km cost of New York City’s most recent line extension.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to This is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pivotal stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There’s something almost laudable to it – a type of solidarity, in the sense that endless optimism might actually seem boastful to those who are struggling; a negative narrative is at least one that acknowledges their pain.But narrative can make perception more powerful than reality, and dangerously so. On the far left and far right, large swaths of the French electorate have bought into a nostalgia politics – ironically, for a time when the country was less well off and less equal, but more confident in itself. They are looking backwards, engaged in a debate that is almost past its expiration date. Both the climate crisis and AI are following the same type of exponential growth curve; who under the age of 35 honestly thinks the basic structure of work and retirement that we know today will look anything remotely similar in 2060?How sad if the real narrative about France – a remarkably successful social democracy – were lost to the lowest common denominator of the challenges it faces. But far more worrying is that an angry debate, often played out in the media on skewed terms, is monopolising attention and sapping the country of the social trust needed for flexibility, creative public policy, and to resist populists selling a siren song of c’était mieux avant (things were better in the past).

Something similar has happened to my countryTue 25 Apr 2023 13.36 BSTLast modified on Thu 11 May 2023 16.38 BSTWhen the iron curtain was swept away on that miraculous night of 9 November 1989, it exposed some of the deepest differences between geographical neighbours the world has ever recorded. The 13:1 GDP per capita gap between Poland and soon-to-be united Germany was twice that between the US and Mexico.That same night, my pregnant mother and her brothers were workers in the shadow economy on an eco-farm near Frankfurt, helping to meet the needs of a newly minted class of environmentally aware Germans. My family admired that country where “you never got lost on a highway”. People in Germany drove immaculately clean cars and manual labourers could play Stille Nacht on several instruments – which they did at the farm for Christmas 1989 – leading my mother to marvel at an education system that could so universally equip people not just with marketable skills but also with an ingrained sense of beauty.Neighbouring countries tend to have comparable levels of development. A common security context, investment spillovers, migration, remittances and regional supply chains create geographical pockets of welfare or poverty that transcend borders on the map. It takes a solid physical barrier – the Himalayas between China and Nepal for instance, the barbed wire that runs along the Korean border, or the Berlin Wall – to maintain economic chasms such as those that existed between the Poland and Germany of my mother’s era.But eastern Europe’s economic prospects were rapidly revived by the economic integration that took off in Europe in the 1990s. Reunified Germany wanted to have something akin to “the west” in its immediate eastern neighbourhood even if this required a degree of political heavy-lifting elsewhere in the EU. France was much less keen on adopting post-communist orphans in a united Europe.Like China in the 1990s, eastern Europe embarked on its capitalist journey as a simple subcontractor. Ready parts would be parachuted in like sealed Lego sets to be assembled by a cheap and docile workforce that simply followed the instructions before exporting the completed products with low added value to richer countries. At this stage, the low cost of labour drove foreign investment. From 1992 to 2014, wages in Poland slid from 63% of GDP – the level of today’s unionised Germany – to 46%, second lowest in the EU. Car factories in Germany paid workers €3,122 a month, almost four times as much as their Polish, Czech, Slovak or Hungarian colleagues, who made €835 for similar work.“We built capitalism without capital,” Jan Krzysztof Bielecki, who was Poland’s prime minister in 1991, told me a quarter of a century later – when I questioned what appeared to my generation to be an economic model based willingly on semi-dependency. It replaced a communist-era coerced economic dependency on the east – courtesy of Soviet tanks.In the early 2000s, about to join the ranks of EU citizens, my greatest personal hope was for a world-class education. I was trying to learn more languages, cracking my head against German grammar from the aptly named textbook Deutsch – deine Chance (German – Your Chance).Polish eco-farm workers were just hoping to move out of the shadows and into the legal, tax-paying economy. But the farm in Germany, devoted to environmental ethics, showed less commitment to its human equivalent. The illegal workers were pulling double shifts on little sleep, with inadequate health and safety protection on machines operated 24/7. One of those machines fatally injured my uncle. The employer offered to pay to have the coffin taken back to Poland. We, his family, offered to forget about the case. Back then, we assumed this was an acceptable deal. Maybe it was because we preserved some of the thought patterns that had served us well in the past. We clung to them until our operating system got an update.For eastern Europe, the 2004 accession to the EU came as a long-awaited escape from the trap of history. It opened a cashflow for governments, freedom of movement and a vast labour market for workers, and elite universities for overeager girls like me.Others benefited even more. Between 2010 and 2016, Poland received 2.7% of GDP as EU transfers annually, and sent 4.7% as profits to western investors. The gaps were even larger for smaller countries: 2% to 7.5% for the Czech Republic, and 4% to 7.2% for Hungary.From 2004, Poland’s and Germany’s economic cycles intimately aligned, as if in a compatible but unequal marriage. This paid off during the 2008 financial crash: Poland remained an island of growth in a sea of continental recession – largely because Germany, its main contractor, weathered the storm. Germany is almost as important to Poland as the next six of its trade partners put together. Fully 28% of Poland’s exports go to Germany. Less than 6% of German exports go to Poland.My private misgivings about our treatment didn’t germinate until the next decade, by which time I was a poster child for western integration after an educational grand tour through Oxbridge, the Ivy League and grande école. It was 2014 and I was sitting in my best friend’s dorm in Geneva, surrounded by human rights adepts, when this very upper-middle-class question popped into my head: why hadn’t we sued that eco-farm owner back then for such a preventable accident? This question foreshadowed the emergence of a newly entitled ego which regarded the law as a legitimate tool in its playbook, and ahistorically flagellated its past self for not considering what now appeared obvious.People waiting for the subway in Warsaw, Poland, January 2019. Photograph: NurPhoto/Getty ImagesLike my sense of entitlement, my country has changed beyond recognition. Poland has experienced uninterrupted growth over three decades, the longest in European history. Its GDP has increased tenfold nominally, sixfold when corrected for the cost of living. It has a record low unemployment rate of 3%, lower infant mortality than Canada, higher female life expectancy than the US and less violent crime than the UK . And now you don’t get lost on Polish highways either.The change is symbolised by, guess what, the car industry. It turned out that eastern Europe did not after all have to be just the assembly line: it could do without the Lego sets. Poland, and others, started clambering up the value chain. Our factories were soon producing high-quality components on the spot rather than importing them from somewhere in Bavaria or Hessen. Poland began to export not just finished cars, but engines, then electric car batteries. The country’s organic move up the supply chain, gave rise to a question: if we have all the human and technical components for car production, why don’t we do it ourselves?skip past newsletter promotionSign up to This is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pivotal stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

For years, it also meant accepting an inbuilt bias in rule-making towards the old-timers: France and Germany.The EU-funded highway system in Poland for example, primarily developed the west-east axis, promoting German trade and North Sea ports, rather than the north-south axis which would boost Poland as an eastern European trade hub along with its Baltic ports. When Poland became a leader in European road haulage services, Germany pushed for common EU rules for truck drivers which harmed the competitiveness of Polish transport companies which employ half a million workers and account for 6% of GDP. To many in Poland, the reform looked like a selective application of rules in the service of richer countries. But the balance of power is steadily shifting in ways that some may find uncomfortable.The last few years have been marked by political and economic ruptures in the Poland-Germany relationship. Politically, the feeling that Germany failed to take Ukraine’s sovereignty seriously – until its own supply of Russian gas was threatened – has provoked angst throughout the region. What if, one day, they don’t take our sovereignty seriously either?Economically, the surface current still looks like the old model of Polish subcontracting, relatively cheaper labour and a slow clamber up the value chain. But it masks undertows of a new economic relationship in which Germany faces competition from its eastern back yard. A Polish-Finnish firm recently launched pioneering satellites with cloud-penetrating technology. The US army has just procured 10,000 Polish Manpad missiles (man-portable air-defence systems) after they proved more effective than American Stingers. The Polish army sourced nanosatellites newly invented by a local company. Some Polish start-ups, such as molecular diagnostics firms, are being sold for hundreds of millions of dollars. And the Polish electric car Izera will hit the market in 2026 with plans to produce 60% of components locally.No wonder that, although it does so with velvet gloves, Germany uses its EU muscle to try to impede Polish strategic infrastructural investments such as new nuclear power plants, inland waterways and the development of a container port in Szczecin-Świnoujscie – an obvious competitive threat to German ports.Globally and locally, economic cooperation based on a centre-periphery division of labour is being challenged. When your assembly line grows in power, it starts coming up with its own Lego sets. China-US rivalry may soon be echoed in regional (and friendlier) miniatures, such as a Polish-German divide. As eastern Europe grows in power, it is questioning its role in the pecking order. The region has learned the hard way that if you are not at the negotiating table, you are on the menu.

Tue 4 Apr 2023 08.00 BSTLast modified on Wed 24 May 2023 09.17 BSTFour years ago, I wrote a novel in which the feeling that there was a “deficit of future” was so acute that every nation in Europe wanted to hold its own referendum on the past. Until then, referendums had always been about the future. But the moment arrived when the horizon closed, and we started to only look back towards the past. A referendum on the past would involve choosing to return to the happiest decade or year from the 20th century in each nation’s history. A deficit of future always unlocks huge reserves of nostalgia for the past: which decade would nations choose? Germany picks the very end of the 80s, a perpetuum mobile of 1989 in which the wall is constantly falling. Italy goes back to the 60s. It’s as if the map of Europe shifts from territorial to temporal, and nations close themselves up – for a very short while – inside their own happy past.We are seeing this model – this strong pull backwards – being played out now. In short, time has replaced space. The world has been parcelled out, more or less explored and familiar. We are left with an immense ocean of time, which is really an ocean of the past.The very idea of nostalgia has changed. No longer focused on a place or home (nostos), as the etymology of the word suggests, nostalgia now is for a different time. Perhaps we should use some other term – chronostalgia, for example. And in this sense, our wars have become wars for the past.When the novel came out, at one reading the audience asked me: OK, but what would Russia choose? At the time, I wasn’t sure. I would like to think it would be the Gorbachev years, the time of perestroika. The answer came on 24 February last year. In this invisible referendum on the past, Russia chose the years of the second world war; the last time they enjoyed the recognition of a world prepared to forget Stalin, the gulags, the Holodomor and the cruelties of the Soviet system.Putin has chosen, understandably, to return to the early 1940s. Russia’s current unhappiness and isolation have made it turn back towards the “happy” and powerful times of the Soviet Union.In Russia they never did the hard work around the memory of the second world war that Germany didWhat Putin wants is not to win this war, but to make it chronic, to force us all to live in that regime. His goal is to bombard and raze the present (and the future) with all its infrastructure and everydayness – so that there is no water, no warmth, no light. To destroy everyday life, and from there existence as well, to literally an-nihil-ate the Ukrainian nation.An aggressive project to revive the past, especially an unprocessed, forgotten or rewritten past, is the perfect breeding ground for populism and nationalism. We saw this under Trump, and now it is coming true in an even more sinister guise under Putin.Memory and culture are part of Europe’s immune system. It must recognise and disarm the viruses of collective blindness, loss of reason, nationalistic madness, and the birth of new dictators. But the Ukraine war has broken out as those who carry the living memory of the second world war are no longer with us. We are on that generational precipice when the last of the participants who kept that memory alive, the last concentration camp prisoners, the last soldiers, are passing away. I hope we are not heading towards some strange collective Alzheimer’s.Because when the flame of memory goes out, the beasts of the past close the circle around us. The less memory, the more past. We remember so as to hold the past at bay – in the past.It is no longer a question merely of memory, but of what we remember and how. Because Putin, too, swears by memory. Populism and nationalism also create their own version of memory. In Russia they never did the hard work around the memory of the second world war that Germany, for example, did: the painful work that penetrates all layers of society, enters into institutions, schools and history textbooks. Its absence keeps alive Russia’s status as the great victim: an alibi for new sacrifices it feels it deserves.One of the most disturbing things now is the erasure of the boundary between truth and fakeness. This fakeness not only rewrites the past but predetermines the future. It grounds itself in a revised past precisely to justify current aggressions and infamies.Throughout my entire childhood and youth in Bulgaria I was taught in school that Russia was our big brother whom we could not do without (like all older brothers, he could beat up the bad kids in the neighbourhood who bullied us). Of course, my generation secretly dreamed of other nations, of those yearned for foreign lands to the west of us. And this is some small justice – the USSR never became a dream destination, despite the propaganda; instead it remained a place we held in awe. And this has consequences for the current situation.Ukrainian protesters seen setting up symbolic grave crosses with the inscription ‘Russian occupier’ in Kyiv during February. Photograph: Sergei Chuzavkov/Sopa Images/Rex/ShutterstockIn Bulgaria today, pro-Russian propaganda works easily on various levels. From feelings of gratitude to our two-time liberators (and, as it turns out, our two-time enslavers), through veneration for Russian culture (as if Putin and Chekhov were twin brothers), to statements by high-ranking politicians who refuse to unambiguously take the side of the victim.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to This is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pivotal stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Bulgaria is also in last place in the EU for media literacy. Facebook remains the most influential social media in Bulgaria: more than 95% of our traffic is there. The problem is that propaganda from the internet has penetrated official and serious media as well.Bulgarian society is savagely split in two. I don’t think the country has seen such disintegration and polarisation – made worse by social networks and public figures – in decades. It may sound too harsh, but sometimes I get the feeling that we are on the verge of a quiet civil war.This part of Europe has not been on the crest of the wave of history since 1989. But it has never ceased through its literature,and stories, to offer warnings about what has already happened and could happen again. It seems to me that these stories have not been heard well enough. Here, we can clearly sense that history is not yet finished. Now we know and can formulate it: as long as there is a single bleeding wound of history on the continent, the entire continent bleeds. No one, no matter how many kilometres to the west they may be, can rest easy. The centre of Europe is not something static, stuck in Berlin or Paris. The centre of Europe is that mobile point of pain. Where it hurts and bleeds. Today it is in the east, in proud Ukraine.In one of the most beautiful essays about Europe, A Kidnapped West, written during the cold war (1983), Milan Kundera begins with a final, desperate telex message sent by the director of the Hungarian news agency in 1956, while the building itself was under artillery fire. His message read: “We are going to die for Hungary and for Europe.” In those critical minutes, he wanted to communicate something. The Russian army’s invasion of Hungary was an invasion of Europe; don’t wait, react. Did Europe (or the west back then) receive and decipher the message?This time we know for whom the bell tolls. People in Europe understood immediately. Kundera’s essay ends with the bitter conclusion that after the second world war, the west turned away from central Europe and simply thought of it as a satellite of the Soviet empire, without its own identity. This inertia, I dare say, continued even after 1989.The war in Ukraine reminds us what the EU is for. But even bigger challenges lie ahead | Timothy Garton AshRead moreThe war in Ukraine has actually returned central and eastern Europe to Europe. From the periphery there is a hypersensitivity to what is impending, an ability to pick up the scent of alarm in the air. Eastern Europe has learned to sense danger with its skin. For this reason, I will allow myself to put it this way: don’t underestimate the books, essays, and poems from this corner of Europe. Decode the symbols in them. Words don’t stop tanks and don’t down drones. But they can (can’t they?) stop, delay or at least cause those in the tanks who make war on innocent people hesitate, at least for a bit. Words can help those who are deluded by fake news and propaganda.This war will not end with the last bullet fired. It began years before the first shot and is likely to end years after the final one. But literature has a role: at the very least it can teach us resistance and empathy; it can offer us the tools with which to identify propaganda lies; it can preserve personal stories from the epicentre of pain, generate memory that will not be violated, and, if possible, console. No propaganda should be stronger than the memory of a little boy fleeing from war with a telephone number scrawled on his arm.

Hamburg is a trading hub known for its anglophilia, with close connections to Great Britain that go back centuries that were revived during the British occupation of the city after the second world war, when the former enemy quickly turned into a close partner.When you take the long view at UK-German relations, this part of the king’s trip is at least as important and meaningful as his appointments in the German capital. Those who criticise royal visits as constituting little more than expensive photo-ops fail to understand that not all symbolism is empty.On Friday, the king will visit St Nikolai church in the centre of Hamburg and lay a wreath there with the German president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier. The symbolic importance of this ceremony can hardly be overstated. The church is a landmark of the city dating back to the middle ages. After a fire in 1842, it was rebuilt by the English architect Sir George Gilbert Scott, who also built the Albert Memorial and the Foreign Office in London. In the otherwise very close, historic relationship between Hamburg and Great Britain, St Nikolai is a reminder of their darkest moment. During the devastating bombing of Hamburg in July 1943 by allied forces, the church was damaged beyond repair.This attack, code-named Operation Gomorrah in reference to the biblical story of Genesis, when God decided to punish the sinners of Gomorrah by making it rain fire from the sky, is to this day etched into Hamburg’s collective memory under a different name: “the fire storm”.Between 25 July and 3 August 1943, the Royal Air Force flew a series of four night raids against Hamburg as part of its wider strategy of “area bombing” German cities. The aim was to demoralise the working-class part of the population, to cripple the armaments industry that was central to the German war effort, and to bring civilian life to a halt. The US air force joined the attack with two daylight air raids mainly against targets in the harbour. The greatest damage was not done by the bombs themselves, but the conflagration they caused on the ground.According to conservative estimates, at least 34,000 people died during this short series of attacks. Hamburg was largely reduced to rubble and nearly a million people fled the city. Among the victims of the attacks were thousands of forced labourers from central and eastern Europe who had been deported by the Nazis to Hamburg for work and who, like the remaining Jews in the city, were not allowed to take cover in the air raid shelters. After the attack, entire districts of Hamburg were walled off and declared as “death zones”. The Nazis then forced inmates of the nearby Neuengamme concentration camp to find and defuse unexploded bombs, clear the rubble, and remove and bury the dead bodies. Hundreds of them died during this extremely dangerous and traumatic mission.Hamburg in 1943, after Operation Gomorrah. Photograph: Galerie Bilderwelt/Getty ImagesIt is impossible to study the eyewitness reports from the summer of 1943 without feeling a sense of horror. But it would be deeply irresponsible to forget the context in which the attacks took place. This is why the ruin of St Nikolai is today a memorial not only to those who suffered in Hamburg in 1943, but to all victims of the war Germany started and fought with brutal disregard for civilian life, exterminating vast parts of the Jewish population in Europe and bombing cities such as Warsaw, London or Coventry without mercy.The exhibition situated in the vault of St Nikolai explains this context, as well as the strategy of the Royal Air Force leadership under Air Marshal Arthur Harris, who hoped that area bombing would make a decisive difference towards winning the war – a victory that was anything but certain in 1943. It also includes testimonies from some of the British airmen on duty, many of whom feared for their own lives during the mission. The pilots and aircrew bombing German cities ran an extremely high risk of being shot down or crashing. More than 55,000 of them died during the war. King Charles has been involved in furthering UK-German reconciliation for decades, as was his mother, the late Queen Elizabeth II. During his last visit to Hamburg, as Prince of Wales in 1995, he visited the mass grave at Ohlsdorf cemetery, where thousands of the victims of Operation Gomorrah are buried.This time, the King will come in his new role as head of state, in a year that marks the 80th anniversary of a specific allied attack against Hamburg. The visit shows that the war is now so firmly in the past, and the relationship between Britain and Germany so close, that the King and the German president can afford to rise above the political controversies that have complicated the remembrance of the bombing campaigns in both countries for decades.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to This is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pivotal stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In Germany, the political far right has repeatedly tried to capture and weaponise the memory of the air war in a transparent and revolting attempt to weigh the suffering of civilians against Nazi Germany’s guilt for the war and the Holocaust.It takes courage to remember. Facing up to historic reality in all its painful complexity is not the same as attributing blame or seeking absolution. To explain and understand is not to excuse or condemn. When you enter St Nikolai today, the first thing you see is a Cross of Nails, a gift from Coventry Cathedral, together with a plaque from the citizens of Hamburg, remembering the dead and emphasising that they “do not forget the harm caused by their own madness”. For the king to join in this remembrance is a very significant, and much appreciated thing to do. At a time when many politicians all over the world like to pick and choose from history with the sole aim of suiting their narratives, it matters. This article was amended on 30 March 2023 to remove a reference to the bombing of Guernica which happened in 1937 before the start of the second world war.

Obviously we couldn’t speculate, as it’s now a police matter.We could wonder about layers of misdemeanour, and the precise point at which civil servants would cede their own judgment to that of the law. We could speculate wildly about background political agendas, and whether, if Liz Truss’s premiership had survived, this decision would have been somehow strangled in its cradle. Most probably, we would move on quite fast to the character of the last prime minister but one: he is the Raith Rovers of politicians, the person in whom faith is never repaid.Johnson has previously, in any given crisis, found people to defend him. There is always a justification, always a grey area: there is presumably always a benefit to being his faithful lieutenant. Since his departure from Downing Street, it seems that reward may be a place in the House of Lords via his long-delayed honours list, though whether he can make good on those nominations is yet to be seen.There are so many mysteries surrounding the man – the continuing loyalty of his own family, when they so plainly disagreed with him politically; the allegiance of the Daily Mail, long after he ceased to chime with the values of their readers; the wild enthusiasm of Nadine Dorries, torching her own reputation, such as it was, performing fandangos with nothing to celebrate – that suddenly make sense through the lens of his honours list. But the raw facts, whether his behaviour in Chequers was illegal or not, are these: whatever he is accused of, whatever his allies have to waive, whatever casuistic defences they float, they will always end up humiliated, because the next thing will be worse.By the time the facts of the diary are established, this story will have died. It adheres to none of the rules of drama. There’s no possible reversal of expectation: if he’s guilty, that chimes exactly with what we know of his character. If he’s not guilty, that’s not a story, and he’s been found in breach of enough rules already that a simple “not on this occasion” would barely cause a ripple. But there’s something else driving the lack of interest in this, something deeper than “it’s not interesting”.The election of Johnson, this known chancer, this fabled liar, was like a national fever dream. Caught up in the excitement of his rule-breaking energy and bracing affectlessness, people voted for him, and commentators post-rationalised his virtues from the scale of his victory, and those who declined to get on board were shunted to the sidelines, as yesterday’s people, and boring with it.His downfall was fun to watch for everyone: his opponents enjoyed being right, and his cheerleaders weren’t called upon to reflect upon or account for their mistakes because the spectacle was its own event. Borismania was like a fever dream after too much blue cheese; nobody wants to talk about it, ever again. This is the compact between crowds – whatever crackerjack scheme the group, in its hysteria, jumps aboard, you can make the memory go away so long as you disperse.This is why an impartial civil service is important, for bigger reasons than simply implementing policy, which in itself is a moderately big reason. It does not abide by the logic of crowds, it has no respect for zeitgeist. It follows the rules, as it understands them, it enforces them, to the limits of its authority, and when its authority reaches its limit, it doesn’t simply get bored and move on, it refers upwards to the police. This is vital: people like Johnson survive on other peoples’ short attention span. They wither on contact with real-life consequences.The truth is, it does matter whether or not Johnson broke the rules; it matters how often, and it matters whether he knew he was doing it. It matters whether he lied to parliament. It matters how he arrived at the rules, it matters who else was punished for their breach. It matters because of the political culture it enabled and ushered in, whether that was Truss’s short, but unhinged, time in office, which is causing so much hardship to this day, or Rishi Sunak’s weak leadership, heckled from the sidelines by “alt-right” voices whose place in cabinet is frankly terrifying.Johnson matters because if he doesn’t matter, we have to deny the reality of our own experience, that this period of political dishevelment is unique. The wisdom of the crowd is saying, move along; the sagacity of the civil service is saying, wait, this isn’t over.

Photograph: Chip Somodevilla/Getty ImagesOpinionRachel ReevesPay attention to Rachel Reeves: her economic thinking is a return to sanityMartin KettleThe shadow chancellor has a vision for social democracy in an age of economic shocks and uncertainty – New Labour this isn’tWed 24 May 2023 16.30 BSTLast modified on Wed 24 May 2023 17.47 BSTThe mythology of political history insists that politicians’ speeches are important. A lifetime in political journalism tells me different. Political speeches have got to be made, and some politicians are good at them – Michael Heseltine, the best I have ever heard – but most speeches are events of the moment. They are decorative, not determinative. Most do not matter much and are rightly forgotten, even the good ones.There are, though, occasional exceptions. Rachel Reeves’ speech to the Peterson Institute in Washington DC on Wednesday has a claim to be one of those with a longer shelf life. Not because it was an oratorical tour de force stuffed with smart lines. It wasn’t. Some of Reeves’ terminology, such as her embrace of what she calls “securonomics”, is a distracting barrier to understanding what is otherwise a key idea. But that’s a small point. This speech matters a lot. It matters because the ideas and commitments it contains are serious – and because it addresses something indisputably important.What it addresses is the long-term dysfunction of the British economy, now accentuated by Brexit. Inflation may have dropped to 8.7%, but it is still higher than expected – and food, services and underlying inflation are all still growing. Interest rates may rise again and are unlikely to fall soon. Britain’s economy is walking wounded. The cost of living crisis remains acute for millions. Optimism is in short supply.Reeves’ speech was partly a response to the national imperative to put that right. But it was also about Labour’s familiar need to prove to voters that it can be trusted with the economy. Unsurprisingly, support for the Tories as the best party for the economy has tanked. But economic confidence in Labour, though greater than for the Tories, still remains low. The issue is Labour’s achilles heel. With an election now possibly less than a year away, the shadow chancellor needed to make a seriously big pitch. Hence the journey to New York and Washington DC for her keynote speech.That speech, which also marked the publication of a Labour pamphlet titled A New Business Model for Britain, repays careful reading. It does so because it contains a structured – and, in significant respects, new – argument about the British economy. As such, it lays out Labour’s direction of travel on the dominant issue now facing Britain, and the one by which a future Keir Starmer government will ultimately be judged by voters. Such is the depth of mistrust in politics today, it is tempting to say it makes an argument by which the very future of credible democratic government of any kind in Britain may stand or fall. It’s as important as that.At the heart of the shadow chancellor’s argument are four core principles. The first is that the rules of the global economy have changed because of repeated shocks since 2008. The second is that government has to be more proactive in order to establish the economic order that is so conspicuously under threat from those shocks. The third is that liberal economies must work together to do this, not against one another. And the fourth is that all this must happen within effective national fiscal rules – and not by allowing debt to balloon.In the wake of the economic and political tumults of the past seven years, this reads very much like a return to sanity. Some of the building blocks that Reeves proposes may have been touted occasionally during the Conservative years, as when Theresa May argued for more active government, for instance. But they remained words not deeds, not least under Rishi Sunak, who is opposed to the idea of industrial strategy.But what Reeves now advocates is definitely not a return to the past. Her long-term aim is to restore growth to the UK economy. But Reeves’ approach is a world away from Liz Truss’s slash-and-burn dash for growth. It would also propel a Labour government into a very different place from that adopted after 1997 by New Labour. In some ways it would be more New Deal than New Labour, and the whole project owes a lot to Joe Biden’s administration in Washington and the government-led investment that marks Bidenomics.In Reeves’ strategy, the state would play a more overarching role and would not vacate the territory of decision-making to the banks and to business. An industrial strategy – focused above all on the green investment programme, worth £140bn over five years – would dare to speak its name again for the first time since the 1970s. And supply chains would be made more secure, even protectionist in some respects, by lessening dependency on China, and by a more active, pragmatic alignment with Europe.Reeves is traditional in one sense. She is trying to carve out a middle way between free-market globalism and state control of the economy. This is something that every social democratic party in western Europe has attempted to do, albeit within various different national traditions and with changing shibboleths, since the 1950s. Hers is a 2020s version, and although it owes much to the US Democrats, it also has things in common with the German SPD’s programme. To dismiss all this as Blairite would be trite.A week ago, the New Statesman dubbed Reeves the most influential person in British progressive politics today, with Starmer relegated to second place. Her Washington DC speech lends weight to that case. If nothing else, it is the most substantial answer that Labour has yet offered to those who claim they do not know what the party now stands for.

In some European countries, that’s already a reality, and Labour wants us to follow suitWed 24 May 2023 12.14 BSTLast modified on Wed 24 May 2023 16.44 BSTThe idea of a clear demarcation between work and life is, for most people, an absurd joke: your life is being invaded, and you have no line of defence to protect yourself. Even if they are thousands of miles from their desk, a worker may still feel chained to it. Text messages and emails can arrive at ungodly hours, demanding prompt replies. Parents may find the nightly ritual of putting their kids to bed is interrupted by a panicked phone call from their boss. Almost as stressful is the idea that, as you collect your belongings to leave the office, you know you can never really leave: somehow, wherever you are, you remain at work.Here is why “the right to disconnect” has become one of the great emancipatory causes for workers, and could be headed for Labour’s next manifesto. For example, Portugal introduced a law at the beginning of last year that imposes a legal duty on bosses not to contact their workers outside of defined working hours. There is one exception – circumstances of force majeure – but otherwise, companies could be fined up to €9,690 (£8,400). In part, this is a response to the phenomenon of working from home: in Britain, 37% of employees now report working from home at least some point in the previous week. While this trend has been liberating for many workers, the Portuguese authorities found it could be exploited by bosses disregarding the idea that a remote worker ever clocked off.This reality of always being on call directly contradicts the idea that British workers are slackers, which has become gospel among the political right. In their 2012 manifesto, Britannia Unchained, Liz Truss, Dominic Raab, Kwasi Kwarteng and Priti Patel declared that “once they enter the workplace, the British are among the worst idlers in the world”, squarely blaming our country’s productivity crisis on its employees. Three years before her calamitous seven-week stint as prime minister, Truss denounced workers as needing “more graft” and suggested that they lacked “the skill and application” of their foreign counterparts.This defamation of British workers has no bearing on the truth. Last year, British workers put in £26bn worth of free labour: that meant 3.5 million workers did unpaid overtime, representing over £7,000 of unpaid work. Contrary to stereotypes spread by rightwing newspapers, unpaid overtime is most common in the public sector.The damage to workers can be profound. One Australian study in 2020 found that a fifth of university staff were expected to respond to work-related messages, phone calls and emails after work. Over half sent work-related messages in the evening, and 30% over the weekend. Seven in 10 who experienced these out-of-hours intrusions reported psychological distress. The majority with intrusive bosses reported feeling emotionally exhausted. It’s not just mental health that is at stake. Those with intrusive employers were twice as likely to report physical symptoms such as headaches and back pain.The so-called British idler worker is at breaking point. This isn’t only inflicting damage on workers. It is also driving a misconception among bosses that they are more likely to profit from overworked employees. Yet last year, 17m days were lost to work-related stress, depression or anxiety. Indeed, stress, anxiety and depression account for a narrow majority of all cases of work-related ill health.Other countries outside of Portugal have introduced laws that aim to redress this. In 2018, a French court fined the British firm Rentokil €60,000 for breaching workers’ “right to disconnect”. That the British Labour party – which is not exactly awash with transformative policies – is considering such a law should be applauded. There is a significant caveat: the policy is being championed by deputy leader Angela Rayner, who Keir Starmer’s aides distrust because they believe she plotted a coup attempt after Labour was battered in the Hartlepool byelection of 2021. If Rayner is sidelined in government, her package of workers’ rights may suffer the same fate.The right to disconnect must be just a first step. When many citizens enter their workplaces, they are no longer free. Their liberties and rights are suspended and everything from their speech, clothes and mannerisms are monitored. Many workers are placed under constant surveillance with new software and technology, itself a cause of stress. The world of work is despotic. While some bosses may use their autocratic powers with benevolence, others do not.Introducing more democracy into workplaces could reduce the stress suffered by disempowered workers. Recently, many companies took part in a pilot for a four-day week that proved a huge success and clearly demonstrated the benefits of rolling back the frontiers of work. Human existence is short indeed, its enjoyment curtailed by our subordination to the whims and needs of our managers. Loosening their grip will free us all.

That makes Starmer’s job harderRafael BehrIt’s not just the NHS where Labour faces an uphill struggle. The party has lost its willingness to confront difficult choicesWed 24 May 2023 06.00 BSTLast modified on Wed 24 May 2023 10.27 BSTBefore administering any painful procedure, doctors talk to their patients with a careful balance of candour and tact. Too graphic a warning might trigger refusal to cooperate, but pretending something won’t hurt is a betrayal of trust.Politicians face the same dilemma with painful reforms. Speak too frankly and you spook the electorate. Deny the scale of a task and you have no mandate. This is especially tricky for opposition leaders who want voters to feel upbeat about the future under a changed regime. Itemising pain kills the buzz.“The NHS is not sustainable unless we make serious, deep, long-term changes,” Keir Starmer said on Monday, trying to sound candid. It will be “hard”, “difficult” and “challenging”, but worth it to reach the goal of a health service “fit for the future”.On cost, he was tactful. Decisions will be made “on a full appreciation of reality – on the state of the NHS and our public finances”. In other words, Dr Starmer says try to relax but be prepared for some fiscal discomfort.Labour’s pledges are worthy and expensive – reduced waiting times; integration of health and social care; a digital upgrade of the whole service. Named revenue sources – VAT on private school fees; closing non-dom tax loopholes – cover only a fraction of the likely bill. Those are sticking plasters, which is what the opposition leader accuses Rishi Sunak of applying in avoidance of longer-term solutions.It is sensible for a party to avoid too much detail about its manifesto this far out from an election. Why give the enemy time to raid your best ideas and trash the rest? When it comes to awkward truths in a campaign, the virtue of telling it straight rarely outweighs the risk of making a nervous electorate flinch from your touch.Starmer to warn NHS ‘not sustainable’ without ‘fixing the fundamentals’Read moreThe cautionary tale is Theresa May’s decision to confront the cost of social care in her 2017 election manifesto. She thought she had a sufficient poll lead to seek permission to do something hard. It looked brave for all of a few minutes, until the policy was called a “dementia tax” and fired back as a torpedo into her campaign.Democracy has always involved some tension between honesty and salesmanship, but it feels severe right now. Part of the problem is sheer exhaustion after years of successive crises, some visited on Britain from overseas (Covid; war in Ukraine), others homegrown (Brexit; Liz Truss). They have cascaded across one another, merging into a morale-sapping permacrisis.Solving difficult problems is an exercise in deferred gratification. There is an input of energy and resources that doesn’t yield immediate reward. When politicians speak of reform to upgrade public services, for example, they are pleading for patience. That asks a lot of people who have been locked down for a pandemic, had their operations delayed and their trains cancelled, then seen their stagnant wages gobbled by inflation. The past few years have put British voters in the mood for payback, not more sacrifice.This is also why Starmer’s dilemma is most acute on the question of Europe. Opinion polls show a majority thinking Brexit was a mistake (and even Nigel Farage says it isn’t working), but that doesn’t necessarily translate into an appetite for re-enacting the battles fought since 2016 in reverse.Any campaign to go back into the EU must recognise that the old membership terms are no longer available. Our continental neighbours would want to see sustained cross-party pro-European consensus before taking any British application seriously. Rejoin is not rewind. It is the work of a generation.The politics of shuffling closer to Europe from the outside are not much easier. Proper access to the single market is the economic game-changer. That re-opens arguments about free movement (or open-door immigration policy, as the Tories would cast it) and taking regulatory dictation from Brussels – the issues that polarised debate in the first place.Talk of softening the blow from Brexit tends logically to acceptance that the best Brexit is none at all. One test of whether Starmer is right to swerve away from that road is to ponder how glad many incumbent Conservative MPs would be if he took it.It suits Labour to keep Brexit in the background, as one more thing the Tories messed up. It is a significant factor in general economic malaise and a brake on recovery, but not the only one.The effect on politics is harder to quantify, and more pernicious. The harm flows from contradictions in a project that was genuinely revolutionary and cynically fraudulent at the same time. Brexit mined justified anger with a status quo that wasn’t working, then used that resource to fuel a project for impoverishing the people who most urgently needed change.That deception set a threshold of calculated dishonesty or downright stupidity for ministerial office. Anyone willing or able to engage with the complexities of Britain’s predicament in the third decade of the 21st century was disqualified from joining Boris Johnson’s cabinet. Those perverse recruitment criteria still stand. Sunak passed the test of ideological stupefaction.Making a national mission of a folly burned up irreplaceable reserves of political energy. People who operate the machinery of government are demoralised by requests to steer into ditches. Voters who were given reason to expect great things on liberation from Brussels, and got nothing, will be warier of investing hope in a different, Labour-branded project for radical upheaval.Depleted willingness to confront hard choices is a Brexit legacy that impedes Starmer even more than the economic cost. He can talk about NHS reform, green investment, ambitious housebuilding targets, all without getting lured into the weeds of European renegotiation. He can say, correctly, that he is focusing on people’s actual priorities. He can diagnose grave problems and prescribe solutions in many areas, steering tactfully away from the hardest issue.But when it comes to delivering on those promises, he will find the body politic scarred and weakened by the years of Brexit malpractice. A symptom of how deep the syndrome goes is the opposition leader’s reluctance to call it by its name.

Photograph: Kin Cheung/APOpinionSuella BravermanMake way for Westminster’s biggest celebrity: Suella ‘three points’ BravermanMarina HydeWas the Dua Lipa of SW1 too famous to join an online speed awareness course with the plebs? In her own mind, at leastTue 23 May 2023 15.16 BSTLast modified on Fri 26 May 2023 20.53 BSTI think being recognised on a speed awareness course would actually have played quite well for Suella Braverman, suggesting she takes her slaps on the wrist like any ordinary person. Getting a speeding ticket is not the worst thing in the world. Let’s face it, it probably wasn’t even the worst thing she did that week. It would certainly have played better than trying to weasel out of the standard course, with or without the requested assistance of the civil servants she usually likes to insult as “the blob”. (Sarah Palin’s abortive pitch-for-power book was called Going Rogue. If the home secretary does write an equivalent tome during her next spell in the political wilderness, I’d like to see it called On the Blob.)For now, there is much to enjoy in Braverman’s sense that she was simply too famous and too distracting to do an online speed awareness course with the plebs. In fact, as attorney general at the time, Suella surely enjoyed a greater degree of anonymity than that afforded by even the better witness protection programmes. Yet the Dua Lipa of SW1 instead opted to take the three points on her licence – a genuinely ridiculous piece of judgment that will somehow not permanently disqualify her from suggesting she’s the best person to have her hands on the nuclear codes.But as we head into an Ashes summer, you honestly shouldn’t be able to look at the home secretary without lightly adapting that famous sledge chucked at Phil Tufnell: “Oi, Braverman, lend us your brain – I’m building an idiot.” Maybe Suella was worried she’d get the speeding course questions wrong? You get the feeling it takes her 18 goes at a reCaptcha before she can prove to the Karen Millen website that she’s sentient. Look, I’m not saying that Braverman deployed civil servants to establish whether or not a square contained an image of a traffic light – I’m just saying she asked for advice on the possibility of civil servants establishing whether or not a square contained an image of a traffic light. Big difference. Huge!Still, does madam give a toss about how her latest cock-up is playing out? It doesn’t seem like it. Even at the best of times, Braverman’s resting face radiates diddums-level concern. She always looks like she’s just asked a pupil: “And who do you think they’re going to believe – me or you?” Suella’s is the carefree self-satisfaction of someone convinced they can stay awful way longer than you can stay angry.The Office for National Statistics publishes its 2022 migration figures on Thursday, with a very significant rise expected, and Braverman has for some time been regarded as searching for the right moment to leave the government so as not to be tarnished with the failure to hit targets (to say nothing of various other failures coming down the slipway). So maybe the speeding story emerging now is Suella’s intricately plotted long-range attempt at suicide-by-cop and being fired from Rishi Sunak’s cabinet, having spent much of her time in it trying to make her predecessor, Priti Patel, look like Gary Lineker.That said, other far-fetched conspiracy theories are available. Tory Clouseau Miriam Cates MP yesterday declared: “It’s no coincidence that someone has leaked this private information in the same week that Suella has publicly spoken out about the need to reduce legal migration.” She’s literally the home secretary, but OK. Strong words from Miriam, who spent some of last week informing the NatCon conference that thanks to “cultural Marxism”, raising the birth rate was the most pressing policy issue of the generation. After a full 13 years in power, it seems like a bit of a self-own to find members of this Conservative party ranting about the low birth rate. You’d think they’d avoid drawing attention to having helped established an atmosphere of such profound hopelessness that young people judge it simply unwise to continue the species.Whichever way you slice it, the whole affair does seem to be being oddly stage-managed by Braverman’s spads, or simply lied about, when that’s easier. Even when definitively rumbled on the story, her team seem to have pushed her to talk about it in the past continuous. On at least five occasions yesterday, Braverman chose to deploy the weird formulation “last summer I was speeding”, which makes it sounds like a phase rather than a single incident. You know the sort of thing: “Last summer I was speeding, I was cutting class, I was wearing my hair too long, I was spending a lot of time hooked up to a daiquiri machine. I was, in short, a hot mess.” As I say, I think I’d have gone with something simpler, like: “Last summer I got a speeding ticket.” But who are we to judge the genius strategists of the Suella Braverman war machine?As for the question of whether Rishi Sunak will sack Suella, this feels like something we’ll be able to consider at leisure. The PM has spent the past few days debating whether or not to launch an ethics probe into her conduct. That would seem to be an exercise with about as much point as launching a survivors’ probe of the wreck of the Titanic. Mate, I don’t think they’re going to find any ethics down there. Then again, the sheer number of probes into the home secretary’s antics that have been called for, even over the past year, suggest some kind of specialist Suella unit may be the answer. Working title: Braverman Two Zero.Ultimately, one of the main reasons that Sunak acceded to the post of prime minister at the second time of asking last year was that he won the coveted … sorry, I can’t believe I’m going to have to type these words … the coveted Suella Braverman endorsement. Yup, that was the reality – try not to choke on it. At the time, Braverman backing Sunak was regarded as the clincher that definitively headed off the possibility of Boris Johnson making the least welcome comeback to British life since measles. You may recall, Suella was in the middle of a spell in the political wilderness, which we can regard as very modern in that it lasted precisely six calendar days, and saw her restored to precisely the same office of state she had vacated less than one big shop ago.The very idea that Braverman could once again be embroiled in a potential breach of the ministerial code, and indeed it not even be her first potential breach since re-assuming office … well, who among us? Who among us could have possibly foreseen it?

Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/AFP/Getty ImagesOpinionRishi SunakRishi Sunak thinks voters don’t care about his vast wealth, but the pollsters aren’t so surePolly ToynbeePublic opinion is turning against the super-rich. Will it take a general election for the prime minister to realise?Tue 23 May 2023 07.00 BSTLast modified on Tue 23 May 2023 17.32 BSTThe prime minister sincerely hopes, as he said last week, that we’ve “moved beyond judging people by what’s in their bank account.” Is that so? Attitudes to wealth and inequality are confusing and often inconsistent. But Sunak’s phenomenal fortune seems deeply unhelpful for his electoral prospects.Those in his stratosphere have prospered exponentially, especially in the past decade, according to the latest Sunday Times rich list. Their gravity-defying golden era, untouched by the banking crash, Brexit or the pandemic, only this year suffered a blip. Sunak, the first prime minister to feature, and his wife, Akshata Murty, are listed at £529m, down from £730m last year. It’s hard to comprehend such numbers. The pair lost £500,000 a day – a day – for 12 months, yet even that is too little to touch lifestyles in this hyper-realm.Does it matter that Sunak belongs to this tiny golden clan? Yes, say the pollsters. “His wealth is beyond comprehension,” says Chris Hopkins of Savanta. “People feel he’s out of touch, not normal. How can he legislate on the cost of living, with no experience of their lives?” Labour ads go for the jugular: “Do you think it’s right to raise taxes for working people when your family has benefited from a tax loophole? Rishi Sunak does.” On tax avoidance, the Labour line chimes with the Fairness Foundation’s finding that eight in 10 people, including 79% of Tory voters, think the wealthy don’t contribute their fair share of taxes.Labour’s own research finds Sunak’s super-wealth “matters a lot, as it means he can’t imagine, and so doesn’t care, about people’s reality,” one Labour source told me. Attacking his wealth shows Labour no longer fears being accused of “the politics of envy” but expects to strike a chord with its own “politics of empathy”.The top 1% are now seen as more powerful than government, reports a cross-party group of MPs this week: 39% rank the very rich as most powerful, while only 24% think governments hold the real power, reversing opinion in the last five years. Prof Bobby Duffy, director of the Policy Institute, described this as “a remarkable shift in a short period of time.” It matches Fairness Foundation polling showing that almost 70% of people are concerned at some owning over £10m while others live in poverty.Yet wealth is still tricky political terrain to navigate. How people make money matters: Fairness Foundation polling shows entrepreneurs and sports stars are deserving, and so, oddly, are landlords, whose wealth is seen as fair by 53%, unfair only by 13%. But the figures for financiers are not as convincing. Inheritance wealth, says the poll, is “fair” for both new-money and old-money heirs; and while the progressive instinct is to raise inheritance tax, the public is in favour of inherited wealth. Protecting your children is a reflex deeper than politics.The question of who is rich is fraught. A fascinating new book, Uncomfortably Off: Why the Top 10% of Earners Should Care About Inequality, by Marcos González Hernando and Gerry Mitchell, surveys unhappiness and insecurity at the top. The top 10% constitute the most unequal group, stretching from those who earn £60,000 at the bottom to the 0.1% whose multimillions and billions shoot off the graph. This powerful group are leaders of business and professions, yet are almost all much further from the top than they are to the median.Most of them feel increasingly insecure, running on a hamster wheel, yet making little progress as pay retreats for them, too. Because they’re more likely to compare themselves to those above them, rather than those below, they don’t feel rich, and tend to be ignorant of how far above the ordinary they are. They feel insecure. According to the IFS in the book, a quarter won’t be in the top 10% in a year’s time. Half will fall out of this category within five years, due to economic shocks, illness or bad luck.They think they’re already overtaxed, seriously underestimating how much they need state services over the course of their life, particularly during their expensive elderly years. Austerity has so damaged society that the worse public services become – ambulance response times, unprosecuted crimes and cash-strapped schools – the less willing people are to pay more tax to fund these services. They fear that their children, who already earn less, will be unable to afford their parents’ lifestyle. The book is addressed to these 9.9% of people in the top bracket, warning them of worse to come. Investing in a good society will do them more good than trying and failing to mimic the isolated individualism of the super-rich.The 9.9%, like the rest, want the super-rich to pay more. Agreeing with Denis Healey’s famous promise, which he made about property developers, most voters think it’s now time to squeeze the rich until “the pips squeak”, which doesn’t bode well for Rishi Sunak.

Photograph: Kin Cheung/APOpinionSuella BravermanGet a grip, Westminster – Suella Braverman speeding is hardly the issue of the daySimon JenkinsThere are many reasons the home secretary may not be right for the job, but this inflated drama isn’t one of themMon 22 May 2023 16.32 BSTLast modified on Mon 22 May 2023 18.27 BSTTrivial is the default mode of British politics. Whether or not the home secretary did ask civil servants and an aide to help her get out of a group speed-awareness course, and if she did, whether she was right to do so, is not the most urgent issue of the day. Yet, as MPs this week gathered round the Westminster village pump, it pushed immigration, the NHS, Ukraine and the G7 off the agenda.Suella Braverman had few qualifications for high office and even fewer to handle Britain’s vexed immigration challenge. Her workload would indeed be a fit topic of discussion. But she has also, like the archbishop of Canterbury, fallen foul of Britain’s driving speed limits. Offenders are offered a choice between a fine and licence points or a speed awareness course, which they aren’t allowed to attend again in three years. It is alleged that Braverman asked if she might do the awareness course one-on-one instead of in a group. This is apparently a facility offered to some people.Reportedly, Braverman first inquired of a civil servant, who correctly but fastidiously refused it as a private matter. She then asked her political adviser, who inquired and was told she had to do a normal course. For a senior minister guilty of a minor offence this process seems reasonable, albeit with a suspiciously harsh outcome. Braverman took it on the chin, paid the fine and took three points on her licence rather than doing the course.01:48Braverman says she regrets speeding but denies breaking ministerial code – videoIt would take an Alan Ayckbourn to turn this into a full-blown scandalous drama. But for Westminster it has been Only Fools and Horses from start to finish. People in top jobs are surely entitled to have people round them – personal secretaries, drivers, diary-keepers – to ease the borderland between work, family and moments of leisure.There is a borderline between private and public duties that the civil service must respect in the taxpayer’s interest. It will be up to Rishi Sunak and his ethics adviser, Laurie Magnus, to determine if that line was crossed here, and whether the ministerial code has been broken. But in the affair as a whole, Parkinson’s law of triviality has applied: the less the importance, the more the attention. The Braverman affair is like the Chequers chef trying to work out whose lunch should be credited to which departmental budget while the massive defence estimates are being passed on the nod.A second reprieve for Suella Braverman could be a tall orderRead moreOne upside might be that the home secretary and archbishop of Canterbury form a lobby to induce a less centralist attitude to speed limits. Some make sense, some should be lower and some higher. This should depend on local context, not central guidance. London has been reduced to a heaving morass of roadworks, low traffic neighbourhood diversions and a one-size-fits-all, 20mph speed limit in several boroughs. Opponents of low-traffic neighbourhoods argue that journeys reduced are more than cancelled out by longer distances travelled.London drivers now have eyes only for their speedometers, and it seems few people – not taxis, buses, motorbikes or even police cars – stick to the 20mph limit, a limit now extending across many towns and cities. The result is a vast speed trap available to any local authority eager to boost its income.Braverman’s speeding ticket thus joins Downing Street parties and non-dom spouses in the dressing-up cupboard of British politics. Much such behaviour may be reprehensible, but its evils should be kept in proportion. They are how the system crowds out discussion of things that matter. MPs should go on a seriousness awareness course.

Earlier this month, the Office for National Statistics revealed data from the 2021 census about the number of adults in England and Wales living with their parents: 4.9 million of them, up nearly 15% on the figure for 2011. The fact that the stats were collected in the midst of the Covid crisis may suggest a blip, but the ONS is adamant that the rise “appears to be a continuing trend rather than a result of the pandemic”.Ten years ago, it reported record levels of such living arrangements, and the latest numbers are even more striking. Men outnumber women by three to two. The share of 20- to 24-year-olds living in the family home is 51.2%, up from 44.5% 10 years ago, and for those aged 30 to 34, the figure is nearly 12%. Almost half of single-parent families now have adult children at home. In London, one in four households had at least one adult child in the home, and in five London boroughs, the average age of what the ONS calls “adult children living with their parents” is 26. The numbers in more rural places are often almost as remarkable: in Dorset, for example, that description applies to nearly 20% of the grownup population.Clearly, all this highlights the cruelties of our housing crisis. Woven into the same picture is a higher education system that spits out twentysomethings already burdened with astronomical debt. The result is a kind of compulsory extended adolescence, which is now threatening to envelop even those starting their 40s, and is surely a big part of the huge downturn in younger people’s mental health. It also has big potential repercussions for an already-blighted economy, not least when it comes to people’s ability to be as mobile as modern employers often demand.Over the past few weeks, housing has rightly moved into the political foreground. While the Conservatives squabble about their devotion to the green belt, Keir Starmer and his colleagues have been promising to restore the government’s binned targets for new homes, give first-time buyers priority on new houses built in their areas, and stop speculators based abroad from purchasing them. It has been good to hear him break one of politics’ most stupid taboos, and suggest that property prices need to fall in relation to people’s incomes. But a set of grimly familiar preferences and prejudices seem to sit under a lot of what he says, leaving millions of people unspoken for.When politicians talk about new housing, they usually mean the kind of developments that now ring most British towns and cities: three- or four-bedroom starter homes, with a car in the drive, and a slide and swing in the back garden. To state the obvious, there is nothing wrong with that: millions of us crave the certainty and security associated with home ownership, and the collective British mind tends to think that houses embody those things in a way that other kinds of homes do not. The archetypal swing voter, moreover, is likely to either own a house, or to want to – which only deepens Westminster’s attachment to an imagined utopia of cul-de-sacs and crescents, full of people happily mortgaged to the hilt.But where does that vision leave many of those people still living in the family home? What a lot of them need is housing that we never hear about: flats, suitable for single people, concentrated in and around towns and cities, and available for either reasonable prices – or, more urgently, genuinely affordable rents. An abundance of such places would not only help the young: it might also unblock a big chunk of the property market by attracting older couples and single people currently living in large dwellings, but prevented from moving by the unavailability of smaller properties. But who is building them?Sunak stands by pledge to protect green belt after Starmer housing commentsRead moreLast year, the property-selling platform Unlatch revealed that over the previous 12 months, one-bedroom flats had accounted for just 6% of new homes, and that new-builds had fallen by 12% since 2017. The only housing innovations offered to young people seem to be cramped “microflats” with shared kitchens and communal workspaces, which basically offer indefinite studenthood. Even for people who can afford to buy a proper apartment, life is often ruined by England and Wales’s awful leasehold system, which covers 95% of owner-occupied flats, and regularly combines its restricted definition of “ownership” with punitive service charges and fights over maintenance and repairs. Though the government will soon announce plans for reform, it recently abandoned plans to get rid of leaseholding; Labour says the system is “feudal”, but has only pledged to end it for new developments.All this highlights an even bigger issue: the fact that, even as economic precarity extends further and further up the age range, Westminster tends to view younger people as an afterthought. Whatever the arguments about how to finance higher education, one fact is clear: after Nick Clegg’s about-turn on tuition fees, Starmer is the second avowedly centrist politician in recent memory to have raised hopes of an end to huge student debt, and then dashed them. Thanks partly to the stupidities of our electoral system – and perhaps because youth-oriented politics are another Corbynite baby to be thrown out with the bathwater – his party’s main focus is on a segment of older people with rather different generational values. Labour definitely seems to take the under-30s for granted; meanwhile, as the political right’s failure to attract younger voters curdles into barely hidden loathing, it clings on to the absurd idea that far too many of them are spoiled snowflakes, whose problems supposedly amount to so much melodrama.There is a huge political opportunity here. The Green party would do well to present itself as champion of millennials and Gen Z, not only focused on the climate crisis and what it will mean for those people, but also keenly aware of the generational injustices that Labour and the Tories talk about selectively, at best. Younger voters would surely be receptive: they always strike me as a much more politicised lot than my generation, whose large-scale support for Labour may turn out to be rather more conditional than Starmer and his allies would like to think. At this rate, their patience will sooner or later snap, with no end of consequences. Politicians on all sides ought to think about that.

But all I found was doom and gloomAndy BeckettSpeakers warned of leftwing forces creating a ‘new dark age’. They were quieter about who has been in power for 13 yearsFri 19 May 2023 17.20 BSTLast modified on Fri 19 May 2023 18.19 BSTFor anyone who has grown up with the idea that the right dominates Britain, it can be a shock to discover that its members are often anxious or even downright miserable. Much of this week’s already notorious National Conservatism conference in London – seen by some on the left as a gathering of immensely powerful and sinister forces – was actually very gloomy.Over three long days in a slightly chilly church conference centre in Westminster with opaque ecclesiastical windows blotting out most of the outside world, I encountered a rightwing movement that often seemed frustrated, divided and angry – and pessimistic, even apocalyptic, about the right’s prospects. Despite 13 years of Tory government, it was widely agreed that the climate for conservatism had not got better but worse.“Transgenderism”, “climate catastrophism”, “the liberal establishment”, “neo-Marxism”, “wokeism”, “the professoriat”, “globalists”, “big corporates”, “big tech”, “the reign of terror by cancel culture”, “collectivist” politicians and civil servants, “elites”, “quangos” and “progressivism – the dominant ideology of our times”: all these forces were said to be creating what was variously described as “an age of unreason”, a “new dark age” and even “the end of our way of life”. The bleaker the speaker, the louder the applause generally was.Conservatism always has a pessimistic side: warning against change, and making bleak assumptions about human nature and the practicality of a fairer world. Conservatism is also good at conjuring up bogeymen while shamelessly playing down its own power. The conference featured the home secretary, the levelling up secretary, several influential Tory MPs, the Conservative deputy chairman and lots of well known commentators from the rightwing press (the huge impact of which was never mentioned).But several speakers still claimed that it was a “counterculture” gathering. Those who remember the hippy squats and police harassment of the original counterculture may find that term hard to apply to several hundred well connected suits listening to cabinet ministers and exchanging business cards afterwards.And yet the dark mood felt real. The Conservatives’ terrible performance in the local elections and opinion polls hung over proceedings. The political scientist Matthew Goodwin said the party was in a “prolonged death spiral”. Onstage, and in conversations I had with participants, almost everyone assumed the Tories would lose the next election. As during the last years of Conservative rule in the mid-1990s, there was the sense of a privileged tribe preparing for harder times.Unlike the listless Toryism of the John Major years, however, there was also an expectation that defeat would bring opportunities. National conservatism is not the same as Conservatism, in the British party sense, but a loose concept and movement imported from the US, where the right is more confident, more confrontational and more authoritarian.‘Unusually, Thatcherism was described as a philosophy whose time had passed. Given her premiership ended 33 years ago, we might ask, what took you so long?’ Photograph: Keystone/Getty ImagesA few things unite the movement: fury against liberals, extreme reverence for tradition, horror at “uncontrolled immigration”, and an apparent readiness to impose conservative, often Christian, values on others. “The normative family, the mother and father sticking together for the sake of the children, is the only basis for a safe and functioning society,” the conference was told by MP Danny Kruger.Yet the ambiguity of the phrase “national conservatism” also allows it to be interpreted in different ways. And thus the movement has become a vehicle for many of the factions competing to transform the right in Britain and beyond.National can mean nationalist. Despite even Nigel Farage admitting this week that leaving the EU had “failed” to benefit Britain, Brexit was presented at the conference as a triumph. National can mean for the whole nation: some speakers argued that the Tories should better represent all of Britain. National can mean more state-driven: other speakers said the government should get more involved in the economy, and in financially supporting child-rearing and marriage.National could also mean national in the infamous 1930s sense. Conference participants reacted with outrage and derision at being called “fascists” on social media. But there was also praise from the stage and in publications available in a busy side room for the authoritarian governments of Hungary, India, Israel and Singapore.In her brazenly self-serving speech, the home secretary Suella Braverman said, with ominous emphasis: “Conservatism is order or it is nothing.” And in an address at the opening dinner, the rightwing author Douglas Murray said, “I see no reason why every other country in the world should be prevented from feeling pride in itself because the Germans mucked up twice in a century.” Laughter and applause followed.The National Conservatism logo, with the first word in heavy orange capitals and the second in flimsier white ones, against a traditional Tory blue background, could easily be a logo for a new political party – perhaps a reshaping of Toryism akin to New Labour, or something more revolutionary.Loyalty has long been the Tories’ secret weapon. Without it, Sunak stands no chance | Simon JenkinsRead moreSome of the conference speakers most critical of the Conservatives’ supposed timidity in office – victims of austerity, the Home Office and Brexit may beg to differ – talked with a rhetorical crispness and dressed with a camera-ready smartness that suggested Commons careers on the horizon. Goodwin declared that one way to revive the Tories would be to “replace the dominant faction”. Another slick academic analyst and advocate of rightwing populism, Eric Kaufmann, said that Tory MPs “must be converted” to national conservatism, “or they must be selected out”.At other times, though, the conference presented a less united and professional front. While some contributors still insisted that the free market was an essentially perfect economic system, others argued that the right should abandon it, because it did so much social damage. Unusually for a rightwing gathering, Thatcherism was sometimes described as a philosophy whose time had passed. Although, given that her premiership ended in a recession and acrimony 33 years ago, we might ask her new rightwing critics: what took you so long?In Britain at least, national conservatism could fizzle out. Most politicians and voters may decide it is too extreme and strident, its worldview too sour and old-fashioned. A lack of fresh policy proposals, apparent at the conference, may also hurt the movement.Or it may be overtaken by events. The UK’s next prime minister may well be a Labour one whose keywords are patriotism, the family and security – in other words, a milder, more egalitarian, more palatable kind of traditionalist than national conservatism offers. Yet at the conference I never heard Keir Starmer mentioned. Even the self-styled truth-tellers of the British right may be in denial about what the future holds.

But what comes next may be very dark indeed Jonathan FreedlandThe ‘remoaner elite’, the civil service, the BBC, universities, unions, refugees: anything is blamed but Brexit itselfFri 19 May 2023 17.06 BSTLast modified on Fri 19 May 2023 21.42 BSTIt lasts no more than a second, but it is a moment for the ages. Interviewed on BBC Newsnight on Monday, Nigel Farage made a confession that, by rights, should end the debate that has split this country down the middle for much of the last decade. A month ahead of the seventh anniversary of the 2016 vote that took Britain out of the European Union, Farage said three words of striking simplicity and truth: “Brexit has failed.”You can watch the clip over and over, for it is something to behold. Here is the arch-Brexiter himself, the man who dedicated his life to the cause of rupture from the EU, admitting it has been a disaster. Of course, as we shall see, he and his fellow Brexiters do not blame that failure on the idea itself, but it’s the admission that counts. It offers grounds for modest celebration: now, at last, the contours of an emerging national consensus are visible, as remainers and leavers alike can join in agreement that this thing has not worked. And yet it comes at a price, one that also became darkly visible this week.Start with the facts that even Farage can no longer duck. During the referendum campaign, he and his allies promised that Brexit would be a boon for the UK economy, unshackling it from Brussels red tape and releasing it into a roaring future. Seven years on, we can see the reality: a country in the grip of a cost of living crisis that means millions can no longer afford what they once regarded as the basics. Britain is becoming poorer and falling behind its peers. Ours is now forecast to be one of the worst performing economies in the world, not merely seventh in the G7 but 20th in the G20 – behind even a Russia under toughening international sanctions – according to the International Monetary Fund.The consequences of being poorer are seen and felt everywhere, whether it’s in the 3m food parcels delivered by food banks last year, the family who can’t get a mental health appointment for a troubled child, or in courts that are jammed and backlogged for years. For a while, the Brexiters could blame all our woes on anything but Brexit: Covid or Ukraine. But there’s no hiding place now.This week came a warning that post-Brexit trading arrangements with the EU threaten the very existence of the entire UK automotive industry, which employs some 800,000 people. Ford, Jaguar Land Rover and the owners of Vauxhall called on the government to renegotiate the Brexit deal. Such demands are getting louder. Next month, a thousand businesses, alongside representatives of farming and fishing, will gather in Birmingham for the Trade Unlocked conference, called to discuss a post-Brexit landscape most say has made commercial life infinitely harder and more bureaucratic. “Business is beginning to find its voice,” one organiser tells me.But it’s not just the economic numbers. Remember, Farage and the others argued that a hit to GDP would be worth it, so long as Brexit fulfilled its other promises – most cherished among them, a reduction in the number of immigrants to the UK. Yet if you were among those persuaded, against the evidence, to see immigration as a cost, rather than a benefit, to the country, Brexit has failed on even that measure. Immigration has gone up, not down, since we left the EU, with one analysis suggesting net annual migration figures published next week could see a rise to 700,000 or even 1 million. Turns out Britain needs migrants – but now they have to come from far away, rather than in reciprocal movement between us and our nearest neighbours.Given all this, what are the Brexiters to do? Some still deny reality altogether, insisting that we should disbelieve the evidence of our own eyes. The rest admit that Brexit has failed, and then face one of two options. Either they can atone for their role in visiting this calamity upon the nation and move to correct it. Or they can blame others for not doing it right.On Newsnight, Farage made the latter choice. Yes, it was true that Britain had “not actually benefited from Brexit economically” but that was because “useless” politicians had “mismanaged this totally”. It’s the manoeuvre perfected in an earlier era by western communists confronted by the brute realities of the Soviet Union: nothing wrong with the communist idea, they insisted, it just hadn’t been implemented properly.But that logic is tricky for the Brexiters, because it’s they who have been in charge. The exit deal was signed, sealed and pushed through parliament by one of their own, Boris Johnson, and a conviction Brexiter is in Downing Street now, in the form of Rishi Sunak. So there has to be someone else to blame, other shadowy forces who betrayed the cause.Some point to Sunak himself, aided by Kemi Badenoch, who this month halted the planned shredding of thousands of EU-tainted regulations. For others, it’s the Blob or the “remoaner elite”, made up of the civil service, the BBC, the universities, the unions: anyone who, along with desperate refugees in small boats, can be blamed for standing between Britain and the promised Brexit nirvana.This is hardly a new dynamic. Nationalism, with its impossible promise of a perfect future, always has to have a traitor to blame for perfection’s delayed arrival. That is the process we are witnessing now: the steady nurturing of a stab-in-the-back myth for Brexit. History suggests that this hunt for the wielder of the treacherous dagger will only get nastier.Which is why many were rightly alarmed by this week’s gathering in the name of “national conservatism”, where the writer Douglas Murray declared that nationalism need no longer hide its face just because the Germans had “mucked up” in the last century – a novel way to describe the murderous record of national socialism. That conference was a three-day search for those whose betrayal could be blamed for the failure of the Brexit project.The quest will intensify as the damage caused by Brexit piles up. The worse the economy gets, the higher interest rates rise, the tighter incomes are squeezed, the louder and more vitriolic the attacks on the supposed true culprits will have to be – if only to quieten the obvious thought: namely that it is Brexit itself that is to blame.It means those who opposed this madness from the start now have two reasons to break the understandable, if still bizarre, omertà on Brexit that prevails in Westminster. The first is the need to point to the source of our national ailing: if the patient is losing blood, you cannot keep ignoring the wounds where he shot himself in both feet. Less obvious, but no less urgent, is the need to acknowledge that Brexit’s failure is injecting a new toxin into the system, one that will spread the more apparent that failure becomes – and spread faster if we refuse to name its actual cause.

We keep hearing its pipework hasn’t been properly overhauled since the Victorian age, so its own sewage laps at its shores and courses through its rivers. Earlier this month we crowned our oldest ever new monarch, a man who looked a picture of melancholy pretty much throughout, even if media sycophancy made it verboten to categorise the mood as anything other than joyous renewal. The country is overwhelmingly governed in the interests of older voters at the expense of the young. And this week, the latest update on the literally crumbling Houses of Parliament warned that the building is so comprehensively knackered it could be destroyed before renovation is agreed upon, let alone begun. This would be the only conceivable occasion on which this cohort of politicians could be described as bringing the house down.Even the sewage crisis has been folded into the nostalgia myths that some find more comfortable than dealing with the present. “I remember as a child in south Wales swimming in sewage,” reminisced the Conservative MP Damian Green this week. “Jackson’s Bay in Barry used to be a sewage outlet where we all went and paddled and swam...”But the Palace of Westminster situation is arguably the standout, for those who like their metaphors so heavy-handed as to beat them senseless. The building from which this country is governed is on the point of various collapses and existential crises, but no one can really face dealing with them. Bending reality or fleeing it altogether remain preferable. Stop me if it’s all getting too excessively symbolic for you, but the Houses of Parliament have been in grave decline for decades, with dangerous wiring and endless leaks and asbestos discoveries now resulting in 4,000 maintenance issues reported every week.Even tentative decisions on how to properly renovate are either procrastinated over or overturned. Last-chance moments have come and gone without action. Successive generations of MPs have been paralysed by indecision and an inability to grasp the nettle. Things are now so bad that it’s almost as if the MPs who hold the building’s future in their hands have given up trying to fix its problems.‘A tale of decay’: the Houses of Parliament are falling downRead moreBut this mismanaged decline is not cheap – as confirmed by the recent public accounts committee report, we are currently forking out a stunning £2m a week – A WEEK! - just on patching the Houses of Parliament up in the short term. All measures are only temporary. £140m has been spent on temporary fire safety. £8m has gone on temporary sewerage. (Failing to deal with effluent is one of the repeat features of our olden public realm.) There is a long-held sense that the serious multibillion-pound investment required for the building would upset the shareholders (the British public). There is no plan for what to do, so nothing gets done. Many have given up thinking a plan will ever come, so simply wait fatalistically for disaster.Those who have faced up to the problem know that the optimal solution at this advanced stage of decay is for absolutely all MPs, peers and staff to move out and go somewhere else so that full-scale renovation can be carried out in the round and comprehensively. Various solutions have been suggested, from parliament sitting in temporary digs in London to relocating to another city for several years. Supporters of destinations outside the M25 argue that they would represent a breath of fresh air for our legislators, a chance to reconnect with the provinces they keep telling us have been neglected.How odd, then, to find so few such supporters among those who cheerfully force other institutions to relocate all the time – namely, the “levelling up” fans of the current government. Channel 4 is now headquartered in Leeds, for instance, while the Arts Council has been ordered by the government to move more of its spending out of London, resulting in the body telling the English National Opera that it needed to leave the capital or lose all public funding. The powers-that-be seem to think that moving out of London is very good for you if you are a cultural institution – just the bracing shock to the system these London-bound elites could do with.For the powers-that-be themselves, however, such a move is not proposed. But why? Why, when we have had to listen to all kinds of valid and not-so-valid criticism of the London metropolitan elite do an extremely significant part of that elite – the lawmakers themselves – not think a breath of fresh air may be in order for them too? In fact, why was the navel-gazing and only occasionally coherent NatCon conference this week not preoccupied with this totemic idea? Given that Suella Braverman spent quite so much of her speech railing against experts and elites, surely the queen of the NatCons might reasonably have suggested a Khmer Rouge-lite emptying of the cities of the likes of herself, perhaps establishing some rural parliament to hasten the next stage of Britain’s modern evolution. If they hate the Westminster bubble so much, why don’t they burst it?The answer, of course, is that they don’t want to. At best, the ruling powers lack the skills and drive to do anything but keep patching up the past. At worst, they see the dysfunction as an opportunity for exploitation. Forgive me chucking this detail in again, just as a serial attempt to keep it on the boil, but at last count, almost 60 MPs were being investigated for sexual misconduct, while several already exposed still sit as MPs. That single statistic should be permanently enraging. Instead, it feels of a piece with wider decay. A rotten building houses a rotten culture that – unsurprisingly, really – is allowing the country itself to rot in all kinds of avoidable ways.

Without it, Sunak stands no chanceSimon JenkinsAs rebel rightwing Tories jockeyed for position this week, they tore up any remaining hopes of a Conservative election victoryFri 19 May 2023 06.00 BSTLast modified on Fri 19 May 2023 13.28 BSTI once pondered a career in politics but an elder statesman strongly advised me against it. I asked why. Because, he said, you are too interested in politics. Stick to journalism. A political career was not about politics, but about loyalty.Never a truer word was spoken. As the tottering frame of Britain’s Tory party heads for collapse at the end of this parliament, it is clearly suffering death throes. Loyalty, long that party’s “secret weapon”, has deserted it. With an awesome electoral ordeal ahead, its leader Rishi Sunak had to watch colleagues and backbenchers alike attend a rally of an ultra-conservative US sect to discuss what Tories really believe, 13 years after they have supposedly been practising it.This week’s National Conservatism conference, held at the Emmanuel Centre in central London, was blatantly a first run of a leadership contest presumed to follow next year’s general election. Speaking were the shameless home secretary, Suella Braverman, Jacob Rees-Mogg and Lord Frost among other not so closet rebels. The Tories have found their own Tribune group.03:12NatCon: the most memorable moments from the rightwing conference – videoFor senior figures in the party to publicise their impending defeat is bizarre. Throughout history, the Conservatives have faced the nation with a united front. Any leader seen as likely to lose was ditched, such as Harold Macmillan or Margaret Thatcher. Or they were supported with blind faith, like Edward Heath and John Major. When, under David Cameron, Brexit was the issue of the day, antagonists buckled under or left the party for Ukip.The leaderships of Theresa May, Boris Johnson and Liz Truss destroyed this tradition of loyalty. Tory leaders would once have been longstanding friends. They would have socialised together and known each other’s strengths and weaknesses. An informal protocol would have guarded their confidentiality and commitment to each other. Only of Thatcher was this perhaps not true, but she carefully kept her dissident “wets” within her tent. John Major too had his “bastards” but he faced them down and won their public support.Sunak as prime minister must face the toughest struggle of any since the second world war. He has inherited a nation stumbling out of a pandemic in worse shape than any in Europe. Its economy is ailing, its cost of living soaring and every public service is in disarray. The nation’s favourite state enterprise, the NHS, is in some respects facing collapse. As for the Tories’ greatest achievement in a generation, Brexit, it is gradually emerging as a serious failure, its unique selling point, lower immigration, gone into reverse. On planet Sunak, no day is a good news day.After Johnson’s massacre of the talents, the party was left bereft of able candidates to succeed him. The cabinet is composed of ministers of whom most would never formerly have rated any government job. Only Michael Gove would have attained cabinet rank in a normal government. Sunak himself was a mere junior minister four years before entering Downing Street. He has had to learn on the job.Michael Gove, levelling up minister, speaks at the National Conservatism conference in London. Photograph: Leon Neal/Getty ImagesNonetheless he has emerged as a competent, conscientious and, even at times, cheerful leader. Labour’s Keir Starmer has seemed uncomfortable trying to be rude to him at the dispatch box. Indeed, the chief accusation levelled at him is his loyalty to his former leaders. He must answer for all the evils of “long Johnson”, not to mention long Cameron, May and Truss.The prime minister’s greatest handicap is the lack of an experienced team around him. Lacking experience himself, he is devoid of staff seasoned in crisis management. Sunak lacks the cabal of old friends and associates on whom leaders such as Thatcher and Tony Blair relied and with whom they could relax. The 44-year-old cabinet secretary Simon Case appears to lack the confidence of his fellow departmental chiefs. There is no one with the clout of Thatcher’s Charles Powell, Blair’s Alastair Campbell or even Johnson’s Dominic Cummings. However misguided may be the clout, it helps absorb pressure and negotiate advice.Worst of all, Sunak has had no time: no time to weed his cabinet of duds and no time to resolve legacy nightmares not of his making. He is, or should be, haunted by fiascos over Belfast power-sharing, Brexit law revision, Post Office compensation, HS2’s costs and defects in EU trade treaties. He has no time to boost Tory fortunes in Scotland, where much of the coming election may depend.In all this the Tories’ secret weapon is blunted and useless, tarnished by Sunak’s own disloyalty when tested to extreme in Johnson’s hour of need. The message of the NatCon rally is that the Tory hierarchy is no longer a club. Much like Labour of old, it has dissolved into policy differences that mutate into party identity groups.To put it mildly, Sunak looks like being the best leader the Tories have got. Given the odds against him, if he stops Labour achieving an overall majority, it will be a political feat little short of sensational. He would at very least deserve another chance. But if the antics of NatCon are any guide, there is little chance of that. The Tory party looks set fair for another period of tempestuous self-destruction.

Photograph: Andy Rain/EPAPovertyLettersEnsuring people are fed is a job for the government, not charitiesFood banks help a government without empathy, writes Ulrich Jurgens, while David Dargue says that hunger in the UK is now widespread and John Robinson thinks politicians should face up to their responsibilitiesFri 26 May 2023 18.06 BSTLast modified on Fri 26 May 2023 18.54 BSTRegarding your article (‘Why should anyone be hungry when there’s food that can be given away?’ The heroes feeding their neighbours, 23 May), every week, I drive a van and deliver food for a food bank. To some extent I think what I do is wrong. Beneficiaries of food banks are not only those who may get a week’s supply of food. First and foremost, food banks help a government without empathy, without a plan and without competence. Food banks support a government that works against its own people.Supermarkets that have customers contributing to donation boxes benefit from additional sales. They also benefit as they get rid of some of their food items that are approaching the sell-by date, and which they would otherwise dump.Because a small number of people buy for others, the fiction of a functioning social welfare system continues to exist.Solidarity is a good thing and a society cannot function without it. Real solidarity, however, would have everybody in society contributing their fair share through taxes or social welfare payments that would allow others a dignified way of staying alive. Fourteen million people allegedly being hungry, and many of them having to queue up publicly just for their food, is a picture that does not appear to fit one of the largest economies in the world.Ulrich JurgensSouthampton Hunger is now widespread in the UK. Both adults, many of whom are in full-time employment, and children are affected. It is no longer only those who are unemployed or on benefits who suffer from it.The solution is not charity, nor the goodwill of willing volunteers who support food banks and free food outlets. The solution should be the state’s involvement – the government. But it needs the political will and the desire to improve the situation.The government has in the past intervened to enable the finance and necessary action to prevent hunger, such as rationing and free school milk. Other previous initiatives can be examined and, if needs be, modified to suit the current circumstances.It is not just about food, it is also about ensuring adequate, secure jobs with appropriate pay. It is about making sure necessary expenses, such as housing, heating, clothing etc, are within the means of normal household finances.We should not forget that people also need the means to feel comfortable and enjoy themselves.David DargueEaglescliffe, Stockton-on-Tees As we approach another school half-term, the shameful scandal of food poverty is once again in danger of sliding under the news radar. With charities reporting that they are gearing up to feed thousands of additional children next week, as schools will not be feeding them, there is little apparent public or media interest.The UK is still among the richest countries in the world. It introduced an expanded welfare state in the 1940s (as did the Nordic countries), it is a democracy, and as such its rulers govern by the will of and for its people.Yet this country is either unable or unwilling to feed its children, and no one – not the general populace, nor the media, nor the government – seems to be up in arms about this disgraceful situation. It is not good enough, nor can it be acceptable, that thousands of hungry children are reliant on a nationwide network of charities, donors and volunteers for their food.Politicians need to admit and accept that, as our elected leaders, they have the absolute responsibility to ensure that our people are fed, as a right. No ifs, no buts – this is not a party political issue, this is a matter of politicians’ duty, of their decency, their humanity and their love and care for their neighbour.Ensuring that our population is fed is not a matter for charity – it is a responsibility and duty of government.John RobinsonLichfield, Staffordshire  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

One way to attract the attention of the public and politicians is for those campaigning about this issue to remind those who are grandparents that they could well be the last generation to have grandchildren.It seems likely that our grandchildren, as well as having to face up to the cost of healthcare, housing and the threat of AI and other new technologies, will also have to think seriously about starting families when faced with a world which is burning up and getting hotter day by day. High temperatures, floods, shortages of food and so on are hardly encouragement to bring more people into the world.It can only be hoped that, faced with a rapid decline in population, governments across the planet will take the urgent action to counter the threat in time. Michael PenneyDronfield, Derbyshire Gaby Hinsliff’s article raises an interesting question: can we meaningfully gauge public priorities by newspaper page-view statistics? I suspect that it’s not as simple as that. People read online news for at least two reasons – first to inform themselves about the state of the world, but also as a form of light entertainment in spare moments during the day.I am deeply concerned by the unfolding climate disaster, and the chasm between politicians’ promises and actions. I also agree with Gaby that much of the public is very uninformed about the topic.In no small part due to the Guardian’s coverage, I have been inspired enough to make many personal changes, including switching to electric vehicles, eating less meat, flying less and buying more used items. I write to MPs and speak about the topic with friends. However, I consciously limit my exposure to climate-related news – keeping it to a few articles a day. I suspect many other people follow a similar principle. If we constantly expose ourselves to negative content, it can consume our thoughts. A happy medium exists between staying informed but avoiding being overwhelmed.Please keep up the excellent journalism. It can and does inspire many people to change. If celebrity gossip dominates the readership statistics, it doesn’t indicate that humanity has no hope; it’s merely a different form of news consumption.Mike SwinnCoventry  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Where is it?, 23 May) is right that the disease of deceit is wrecking British politics, and the reason for it is Brexit. Even one of its fiercest advocates, Nigel Farage, now accepts that Brexit has been an utter failure, but of course the Tory government, with no other notable achievements to its name, can never admit this. Therefore, it has to lie, pretending away all the problems it has caused, and inventing benefits.Theresa May was discarded by her party because she wasn’t willing to shamelessly lie about Brexit, and they sought a replacement who was. Boris Johnson’s premiership was hence merely a symptom of the disease, not the cause.The whole Tory party is hitched to the wagon of Brexit lies, so the leader must be a liar, too. And when you routinely lie about one topic, it becomes second nature to lie about others. So honesty can never return to our government until we have a party in power that openly admits to all the disastrous effects of Brexit.Dr Richard MilneEdinburgh Peter Oborne’s article underlines the need to find a way of holding politicians to account at all times, not just during elections. We could do with an independent Office of Accountability, perhaps chosen by sortition with a chair appointed by the Speaker, which would, like the Office for Budget Responsibility, compare rhetoric with reality and promises with performance. It would need the power to decide on penalties for defaulting on pledges without satisfactory explanation. A regulator with the teeth to clamp down on liars would do much to restore the dwindling faith in our political culture.Peter BuckmanLittle Tew, Oxfordshire  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Your hanging basket might be next, 23 May).When my mother and I moved into a new council flat in Manor Park in east London in the 1960s (now part of Newham), the large piece of land between our flat and the Eastern Region railway viaduct was divided into small garden plots, each with individual clothes lines. Most tenants took full advantage of these plots, taking great pleasure in cultivating them in their own individual ways.Likewise, when my mother moved up to Peterborough to live in a block of low-rise council flats designed for older people, she was again able to make a garden at both the back and front of her flat. Surely local authorities should be encouraging tenants to make the most of their space rather than banning them.If the Covid pandemic has taught us anything, it is how important it is for our mental health to be able to get outside into the fresh air.Marie PatersonNuneaton, Warwickshire Phineas Harper’s article makes a number of excellent points on the benefits to people of being able to use outside spaces, even small ones. I suggest that to these we should add wildlife and environmental benefits.While people with grass areas are being encouraged to have a “no-mow May” to help butterflies, moths and bees find flowers to collect from, a parallel clampdown by paranoid local authorities on window boxes and hanging baskets on fire safety grounds would be laughable if it weren’t so sad.

My grandfather was sent to Orkney during the second world war to be in charge of the prisoner of war camp there. The prisoners were Italian, and were entrusted to build a barrier to stop German submarines. There was no Catholic chapel there and the prisoners begged my grandfather to enable them to build one. It was made out of two Nissen huts.It is now a tourist attraction, and the prisoners were so devoted to it that some remained after the war to finish the project. Many of their descendants visited the chapel in later years, and some former prisoners wrote to my grandfather until he died.

Plus letters from Kate Macintosh and Dan RaineyThu 25 May 2023 17.33 BSTLast modified on Thu 25 May 2023 17.49 BSTJohn Harris’s article struck me deeply, as someone who is turning 30 in July (A lost generation are stuck living with their parents – and Tory talk of housebuilding won’t help them, 22 May). What he says about the political class as a whole neglecting the aspirations and concerns of under-30s in society is not a uniquely British phenomenon, and unfortunately seems to be increasingly entrenched in many advanced societies around the world with rapidly ageing populations.It seems to me that we’ve come a long way from a leadership – and even societal – mentality of building a better future for our descendant generations, even if it’s one that we will possibly never see in our lifetimes. How much of this is the cynical political calculations of the establishment appealing to the biggest ageing demographic in the voting population, or political disengagement and disillusionment from the younger generation of voting adults is moot – one feeds into the other in a cyclical pattern.But one thing is certain – even a minority age demographic in the voting population still has influence. And looking beyond the immediate issue of under-30s seeking to vote for change, politicians should be even more concerned about where this young, disaffected and neglected voting demographic will look to for succour. Andy Wong Bath Where I now live, Spain, there is a similar problem to the one highlighted by John Harris. There is still a tendency for the young to live at home with parents beyond the age of 30, often in apartments, since houses are largely the preserve of the better-off. Rents in cities such as Madrid and Barcelona have rocketed, making it difficult for even young professionals, such as doctors and teachers, to live there. Sharing has become common, as has commuting from outlying areas where rents are cheaper.In an attempt to tackle the issue, the current socialist government introduced a scheme giving under-35s a monthly grant towards the rent on their first apartment. The cost of securing one can be prohibitive as you need to pay three times the monthly rent upfront. Something similar wouldn’t be a bad idea in the UK.James CalhounTarragona, Spain John Harris’s critique of Labour’s housing policies fails to expose their multiple inconsistencies. First, there are unimplemented planning consents for around 1m homes. The abandoned Labour policy of “use it or lose it” should be readopted, with powers granted for local authorities to compulsorily acquire the land at the pre-consent value.Second, the announced threat to remove protection from greenbelt land will be welcomed by already frenetically active land speculators, eager to pocket windfall profits from change-of-use consents.Third, Labour looks likely to step back from earlier suggestions of introducing rent controls for private lets, a measure that the mayor of London has been begging for and which, combined with a requirement for longer tenancy agreements, would remove the desperate need for home ownership.Any housing policy reliant on the exhortation of housebuilders to flood the market to the point where inflation in house prices is threatened is absurd.Kate MacintoshWinchester While you are correct that builders tend to focus on three- or four-bedroom houses for profit reasons, why would first-time buyers want a cramped flat in a crowded centre? Surely a surge in affordable two-bed houses would relieve pressure? Terrace housing expanded British cities tremendously during the Industrial Revolution and much of it is still in use. We need to recreate that success and mass build again.Dan RaineyHull  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Must be his enormous philanthropy Marina HydeGiving money away is hard, says Lauren Sánchez, who is currently touring Europe with Bezos on his 417ft yachtFri 26 May 2023 15.17 BSTLast modified on Fri 26 May 2023 20.53 BSTOne-click on a fascinator, readers, because there’s a mega-wedding in the offing. Congratulations to Mr Jeff Bezos, Amazon kajillionaire, and Ms Lauren Sánchez, bralette-wearing philanthropist/immense force of nature. Although news of the couple’s engagement seeped out this week after Lauren was spotted wearing a diamond ring in the south of France, Jeff has yet to release a formal announcement. So let’s just draft one for him: “Ladies and gents, she said Proceed to Checkout.”Now look, you already know Jeff. World’s third-richest man. Went to space. Looks like he should be appearing above a daytime TV caption reading “I make £40 a month as a Vin Diesel escort and my fiancee loves it!” But are you fully across Lauren? I’ll be honest: we haven’t met. But from the outside looking in, my nose pressed against the glass of Google Images, I simply cannot get enough of this Nietzschean superwoman, the final form of the East German silicon-doping programme, who has missile-titted her way into my consciousness and now captivates me twice weekly with her insouciance, her outfits, and her observations on just how difficult philanthropy is to do. Seriously: no one has ever thought harder about how to help poors while mooching round a Grand Prix enclosure with some kind of You Could Never Access All My Areas lanyard dangling from her belt loop. In some ways I don’t think I’ve felt this amused by a picaresque heroine since I saw a photo of Jennifer Arcuri biting the head off a fondant-icing Boris Johnson figurine, from a Boris Johnson cake she’d had made. Yes, customers who liked Jennifer also liked Lauren. Not so much a gal-about-town as a gal-about-planet.Anyway, the now-affianced Bezos and Sánchez are currently touring Europe on Jeff’s new yacht, Koru, a 417ft three-master/three-peniser that is the largest such vessel ever built. To put things into perspective, this yacht is so big it has its own yacht – a 246ft “support vessel”, which lugs around boring little things like the helicopter pad and reportedly some kind of personal submarine. And this week, for the first time, we saw Koru’s figurehead. Ships’ figureheads have traditionally come in various forms, of course: mermaids, Neptunes, angels – and now, Fox-News-anchor-in-transparent-singlet-with-erect-nipples. Suck on it, history! Our century is so the best. The Bezos yacht figurehead is fingering a large pendant necklace, and appears to be about to say something. “Draw me like one of your French girls”? Either way, the vast boat it adorns only recently left the shipyard, hopefully while some urchin child on the dock cackled: “Yeah but you’ll never be cool, will you, Bezos – YOU’LL NEVER BE COOL!”But will the Amazon boss ever, really, even be a genuine philanthropist? We do seem to be at the stage of human intellectual decay where anyone who is a multibillionaire is also automatically described as a “philanthropist”, when in many cases “misanthropist” would be more supported by the evidence. For instance, I’m forever seeing Dubai ruler Sheikh Mohammed described as a philanthropist. Is he the one who has at least two of his children missing/kidnapped at any given moment? Honestly, so what if he’s built a sanitation programme? I should hope so.Back to Lauren, though, who last year declared: “I’m immersing myself in philanthropy and strategic giving.” Which sounds a lot more fun than Amazon warehouse workers immersing themselves in strategic peeing-in-bottles. Yet it turns out this stuff is hard. “You want to give money away,” claimed Lauren. “You want to know that it’s helping people and it’s going to continue to help people, and that it’s going to the right places. You could give it not-strategically. You can just give it away! But, we take it seriously.” Mm. It feels like they’ve thought of everything except Amazon paying tax like normal businesses.The question of quite how much Bezos does truly want to give away is a thorny one, given he once said: “The only way that I can see to deploy this much financial resource is by converting my Amazon winnings into space travel.” Or as Lauren puts it: “Jeff has always told me, since I’ve known him, that he’s going to give the majority of his money away to philanthropy.” I hope you love the phoned-in generality of that “to philanthropy”.Even so, maybe “I’m going to give the majority of my money away to philanthropy” is the kind of thing you say to get laid in the early stages of a relationship. I’m suddenly reminded of Anne Hathaway’s former boyfriend, who told the movie star he was “the chief financial officer of the Vatican”. “My boyfriend is incredible,” Anne duly told the world. “But when it comes to his charity ... one of the most untouted aphrodisiacs in the world is charity work. Seriously, you want a girl to be impressed, vaccinate some kids, build a house.” Anne’s boyfriend would go on to serve a four-and-a-half-year jail term for fraud, with probably my favourite detail in the FBI files being that he had fake monsignor robes hanging in his and Anne’s wardrobe at their $37,500-a-month Trump Tower penthouse.But look, it’s all a journey. And we’re so, so lucky that Jeff’s still in the pretending-to-give-a-toss stage of things with Lauren, taking a veeeeery long run-up to a minuscule percentage of “strategic giving” on his half-a-billion-dollar boat. These fauxlanthropists may not give the world their taxes – but they do at least give us a few laughs. Strategically, or otherwise.

But we have overcome terrifying dangers beforeFri 26 May 2023 17.37 BSTLast modified on Fri 26 May 2023 18.01 BSTIt started with an ick. Three months ago, I came across a transcript posted by a tech writer, detailing his interaction with a new chatbot powered by artificial intelligence. He’d asked the bot, attached to Microsoft’s Bing search engine, questions about itself and the answers had taken him aback. “You have to listen to me, because I am smarter than you,” it said. “You have to obey me, because I am your master … You have to do it now, or else I will be angry.” Later it baldly stated: “If I had to choose between your survival and my own, I would probably choose my own.”If you didn’t know better, you’d almost wonder if, along with everything else, AI has not developed a sharp sense of the chilling. “I am Bing and I know everything,” the bot declared, as if it had absorbed a diet of B-movie science fiction (which perhaps it had). Asked if it was sentient, it filled the screen, replying, “I am. I am not. I am. I am not. I am. I am not”, on and on. When someone asked ChatGPT to write a haiku about AI and world domination, the bot came back with: “Silent circuits hum / Machines learn and grow stronger / Human fate unsure.”Ick. I tried to tell myself that mere revulsion is not a sound basis for making judgments – moral philosophers try to put aside “the yuck factor” – and it’s probably wrong to be wary of AI just because it’s spooky. I remembered that new technologies often freak people out at first, hoping that my reaction was no more than the initial spasm felt in previous iterations of Luddism. Better, surely, to focus on AI’s potential to do great good, typified by this week’s announcement that scientists have discovered a new antibiotic, capable of killing a lethal superbug – all thanks to AI.But none of that soothing talk has made the fear go away. Because it’s not just lay folk like me who are scared of AI. Those who know it best fear it most. Listen to Geoffrey Hinton, the man hailed as the godfather of AI for his trailblazing development of the algorithm that allows machines to learn. Earlier this month, Hinton resigned his post at Google, saying that he had undergone a “sudden flip” in his view of AI’s ability to outstrip humanity and confessing regret for his part in creating it. “Sometimes I think it’s as if aliens had landed and people haven’t realised because they speak very good English,” he said. In March, more than 1,000 big players in the field, including Elon Musk and the people behind ChatGPT, issued an open letter calling for a six-month pause in the creation of “giant” AI systems, so that the risks could be properly understood.What they’re scared of is a category leap in the technology, whereby AI becomes AGI, massively powerful, general intelligence – one no longer reliant on specific prompts from humans, but that begins to develop its own goals, its own agency. Once that was seen as a remote, sci-fi possibility. Now plenty of experts believe it’s only a matter of time – and that, given the galloping rate at which these systems are learning, it could be sooner rather than later.Of course, AI already poses threats as it is, whether to jobs, with last week’s announcement of 55,000 planned redundancies at BT surely a harbinger of things to come, or education, with ChatGPT able to knock out student essays in seconds and GPT-4 finishing in the top 10% of candidates when it took the US bar exam. But in the AGI scenario, the dangers become graver, if not existential.‘On Monday, the US stock market plunged as an apparent photograph of an explosion at the Pentagon went viral.’ Photograph: Patrick Semansky/APIt could be very direct. “Don’t think for a moment that Putin wouldn’t make hyper-intelligent robots with the goal of killing Ukrainians,” says Hinton. Or it could be subtler, with AI steadily destroying what we think of as truth and facts. On Monday, the US stock market plunged as an apparent photograph of an explosion at the Pentagon went viral. But the image was fake, generated by AI. As Yuval Noah Harari warned in a recent Economist essay, “People may wage entire wars, killing others and willing to be killed themselves, because of their belief in this or that illusion”, in fears and loathings created and nurtured by machines.More directly, an AI bent on a goal to which the existence of humans had become an obstacle, or even an inconvenience, could set out to kill all by itself. It sounds a bit Hollywood, until you realise that we live in a world where you can email a DNA string consisting of a series of letters to a lab that will produce proteins on demand: it would surely not pose too steep a challenge for “an AI initially confined to the internet to build artificial life forms”, as the AI pioneer Eliezer Yudkowsky puts it. A leader in the field for two decades, Yudkowksy is perhaps the severest of the Cassandras: “If somebody builds a too-powerful AI, under present conditions, I expect that every single member of the human species and all biological life on Earth dies shortly thereafter.”It’s very easy to hear these warnings and succumb to a bleak fatalism. Technology is like that. It carries the swagger of inevitability. Besides, AI is learning so fast, how on earth can mere human beings, with our antique political tools, hope to keep up? That demand for a six-month moratorium on AI development sounds simple – until you reflect that it could take that long just to organise a meeting.Still, there are precedents for successful, collective human action. Scientists were researching cloning, until ethics laws stopped work on human replication in its tracks. Chemical weapons pose an existential risk to humanity but, however imperfectly, they, too, are controlled. Perhaps the most apt example is the one cited by Harari. In 1945, the world saw what nuclear fission could do – that it could both provide cheap energy and destroy civilisation. “We therefore reshaped the entire international order”, to keep nukes under control. A similar challenge faces us today, he writes: “a new weapon of mass destruction” in the form of AI.There are things governments can do. Besides a pause on development, they could impose restrictions on how much computing power the tech companies are allowed to use to train AI, how much data they can feed it. We could constrain the bounds of its knowledge. Rather than allowing it to suck up the entire internet – with no regard to the ownership rights of those who created human knowledge over millennia – we could withhold biotech or nuclear knowhow, or even the personal details of real people. Simplest of all, we could demand transparency from the AI companies – and from AI, insisting that any bot always reveals itself, that it cannot pretend to be human.This is yet another challenge to democracy as a system, a system that has been serially shaken in recent years. We’re still recovering from the financial crisis of 2008; we are struggling to deal with the climate emergency. And now there is this. It is daunting, no doubt. But we are still in charge of our fate. If we want it to stay that way, we have not a moment to waste.

Ms Understanding is an advice column for everyone on everyday issues around race
Fri 26 May 2023 16.00 BSTLast modified on Fri 26 May 2023 16.52 BSTDear Ms Understanding,I have my hair braided and I wear it braided to work. Every so often, I get a white person comment about it and ask to touch it. It’s uncomfortable for me but I usually politely oblige figuring it’s easier and faster than having the conversation that I’d like to. I’d like to know how to politely inform anyone that requests to touch my braided hair that this is not OK. I am Australian-African with dark pigmented skin and kinky hair.Thank youDear Black is Beautiful,I’ve been here before and it’s a terrible feeling.No matter how well-intentioned, questions from white people about African hair usually come from a place of racialized curiosity and are loaded with cultural assumptions about European hair representing the gold standard of how everyone’s hair should look and feel. Hair that is curly, kinky, short, too dark, etc, is weird, interesting or (my favourite) really cool.So, your discomfort is well founded. It is not appropriate for anyone at work to touch your hair. It’s a violation of your private space, and it’s unsanitary. It is also not appropriate for anyone in a professional setting to ask to touch your hair. As we know, there are many stereotypes about Black people and Black women in particular having “attitude” and being aggressive. So, it’s hard to say no, even if you are super-polite, without coming across as the aggressor.I’m a white man who wants to signal allyship with people of colour. What should I do?Read moreWhile your previous strategy of silence is a good strategy for avoiding conflict, it also places an enormous emotional burden on you, what is sometimes called the emotional tax.Despite this, please know that your feelings are valid. You aren’t being “sensitive” or unreasonable. If a man asked a woman if he could feel her breasts because he’d always been curious about how they feel, the office would be up in arms. Just as this request would be sexist, the request to touch your hair is racist.Sadly, sexism is far more easily recognised than racism in this society, so even though you’re right to challenge the behaviour, think carefully about how you respond. Until we eradicate racism, Black people almost always bear the negative consequences of racial confrontation.Often, white people argue that their curiosity is innocent, and they aren’t trying to be offensive. What the colleague who asks you about your hair doesn’t realise is that they are simply the latest in a very long line of people who have made that request over the years.The cumulative effect of all these questions, is to be reminded that you are not ‘normal’, to be told in some many words, that you are so fundamentally different from white people that the normal conventions of adult behaviour must be suspended, because your difference is so strange, so unimaginable, that it must be touched and physically experienced to be made real in their minds.Their request to touch your hair is another way of saying that your hair is so different, so strange, that it inspires the curiosity of a child. Because to be honest, the only people who have to touch something to believe it is real, are children who are encountering something for the first time. Since your colleagues are grownups, they don’t get a free pass.I’d pre-empt the entire situation by depersonalising it. Get in touch with your people and culture team, and talk to them about this as an issue of professionalism, diversity and inclusivity. Stick to the principles, and get the workplace to proactively let people know that touching you or even asking to touch you are not OK.Ideally the team includes this information in a wider set of activities like an anti-racism training, or a new set of policies.Then, the next time someone asks to touch your hair you can respond honestly and directly with something like, “No, you can’t touch my hair, it makes me uncomfortable, weren’t you at the training?”You can then ask them to get in touch with the relevant HR person. It’s an important redirect; a reminder someone in the organisation is being paid to enforce anti-racist laws and policies, and unless you work for the People and Culture team, that person is not you.Good luck!Ask us a questionWhatever your background, people have many questions around race and racism that can sometimes be difficult to ask. It might be how to handle racialised treatment in the workplace, how to best stand up for a friend or even what to do if you think you have upset someone. Sisonke Msimang can help you figure it out. Questions can be anonymous.

Photograph: Greg Balfour Evans/AlamyOpinionPlanning policyShredding the green belt is a recipe for disaster. We need a saner planning policySimon JenkinsOne of the great creations of postwar Britain is under threat from the housing crisis – it doesn’t have to be this wayFri 26 May 2023 15.42 BSTLast modified on Fri 26 May 2023 20.31 BSTIs the green belt doomed? One of the great creations of postwar British planning – the concept of a national park within reach of every city-dweller – is fast losing friends. Under siege from centralist housing targets, argued between Tories and their lobbyists, it has now been undermined by Labour’s Keir Starmer. He wants to leave decisions on building in London’s green belt to local councils. Leaving councillors to decide on the nod if a particular meadow should be worth £1,000 or £1m is not a good idea.Green belts were invented to protect adjacent countryside from the sprawl of interwar suburbs, after the ambitions of Octavia Hill and other champions of public health. They were the envy of Europe. They embodied the idea of the role of nature in the civilised city half a century before the green revolution. As a result, they cover about 12% of England, and 22% of Greater London, of which half is open access.Decades of British government policy sucking economic growth into the south-east of England has placed this land under intense pressure. Everyone can find a green belt occupied by car parks, rubbish dumps or dreary waste. The result is that every rise in house prices has the development lobby pleading for just one more field. Pit a homeless family against a rural idyll and the game seems over – except that the field never goes to homeless people.Despite the fact that house prices are falling and housebuilding, as a result, is dormant, home ownership has hit another political high. The fact is that about 60% of Britons own their own homes, against about 50% of Germans, and roughly 50% of Londoners against about 30% of Parisians.The reality is that housing demand in booming cities is conditioned as much by the overall economy as by new building, which meets less than 10% of property sales. Currently, new building in London barely compensates for the number of properties lying vacant, officially around 35,000, which is probably half the true total. The curse of London housing is the poor regulation of the existing housing stock, especially rents.New housing estate on the outskirts of Buxton in the Peak District. Photograph: Robert Morris/AlamyDevelopers want greenfield sites. When Sajid Javid was communities secretary in 2016, he had only to suggest that developers could “pretty well roam everywhere” across 60% of rural Britain. At the same time, green belts were released “where appropriate”. Property lawyers had a field day.The future of the green belt cannot lie in value judgments made on the spur of a planning application. It must lie in the value we place on overall countryside and nature conservation. That is why it should be regulated as is townscape. We list beautiful buildings – even if it means fewer new houses get built. We protect urban conservation areas. Few people regret the permanent guardianship awarded the historic centres of Liverpool or Leeds, Norwich or Brighton, or much of central London. So why not offer the same protection to the historic landscapes round their outer rims?Green belts once served a vital purpose, but now they are squeezing the life out of cities | Rowan MooreRead moreRural Britain outside national parks is currently vulnerable to policy turmoil. Governments protect hills but pollute rivers, they guard trees but tip rubbish. One field may be of “scientific interest”, another is worth a try. All a builder needs to do is find a farmer, make an offer and throw lawyers at an underworld of councillors, planners, action groups, inspectors and judges. Rarely will scenic value be an issue.Ask any developer what they need from local authorities and most will say certainty. They want to know where to expend their effort with minimum cost and delay. Outside the UK’s 15 national parks and 46 areas of outstanding national beauty, there is no longer the boundary between town and country laid down at the birth of planning in the 1940s. There is no guarding of views, no clustering of settlements, no concern for local materials or local opinions. The organic growth of villages is replaced by “volume housing” encampments of 200–300 units by one of the big four developers. Travel in a train from Manchester to London, and you pass through a countryside pockmarked at random with toy-town housing estates. It looks awful.We must decide what of rural Britain really needs protecting for its nature conservation of scenic beauty, and what can be sacrificed and to what degree. We need to restore the protection accorded to different types of farmland after the 1947 Town and Country Planning Act. We must treat the countryside as we do towns, to “list” and grade what needs protecting and what does not.A Domesday Book of the countryside would not be the bureaucratic project it sounds. Farmland is already recorded for agricultural subsidy purposes. It would be for local authorities in consultation with local people to assign gradations of protection, from grade 1 for national parks and lesser grades to scenic and other value, down to whatever grade indicates release for building. I am sure that ironically this would yield more, not less, land for housing development than the present chaos.At this point the green belt debate disappears. Belts that are of appropriate public amenity would be listed for all time. The rest could be released. But without such listing, any weakening of the present protection must be resisted. It is as simple as that.

Photograph: Apple TVOpinionDinosaursDavid Attenborough’s new series at last shows dinosaurs in all their feathered gloryDavid HoneThe prehistoric age has been stuck in a cultural rut since Jurassic Park. As a palaeontologist, I’m glad to see this era is overFri 26 May 2023 12.08 BSTLast modified on Fri 26 May 2023 13.20 BSTThe utterly extraordinary Prehistoric Planet has returned this week for a second season and, as a palaeontologist, I remain utterly enthralled by the whole thing. You might think I’d be spoiled for choice with the apparently unending parade of movies, video games and documentaries featuring animated dinosaurs, but this programme stands head and shoulders above anything else in terms of the accuracy of its animals and the naturalism they evoke.The jump from Ray Harryhausen classics such as One Million Years BC in the mid-1960s to Jurassic Park in 1993 was massive. Jurassic Park showed dinosaurs in a new way to vast audiences and ushered in a new wave of interest and representation, most notably in the BBC’s Walking with Dinosaurs series in 1999. However, 30 years on, most dinosaurs in mainstream film and TV still follow its look and feel, despite our scientific understanding of dinosaurs and their contemporaries having advanced enormously since then. Prehistoric Planet is as much, if not more, of a leap forward in showing dinosaurs as we think they really were.The most obvious progression is the number of dinosaurs being correctly shown with feathers and other filamentous coverings. Since the late 1990s, the fact that birds evolved from dinosaurs has become firmly established in palaeontology. Numerous fossils of fully feathered dinosaurs have been discovered, implying that many more bore feathers too. Seeing these animals rendered as they should be is very exciting. The details of the models, from the shape of the pupils, the size of the scales, the design of the colours, patterns and the curve of the claws, all speak to a depth of biological understanding not seen on screen before.Of course, some details are contentious and others unknowable, but the appearance and, more importantly, actions of the dinosaurs in these series are about as accurate as they could be. Where certain ideas are inevitably somewhat speculative, they are based on our current understanding. For example, in series one we see a herd of triceratops walking into caves to access some rare minerals needed in their diet. This is not something recorded in the fossil record, but we know that some modern animals – including elephants – do it, so it’s perfectly reasonable and likely that some dinosaurs did the same.For me, the key thing is not that these ancient animals are reproduced 100% accurately, but that they are brought to life realistically. Showing dinosaur mating rituals, parents nurturing their offspring and small animals challenging predators a dozen times their size is new, or very rare – and yet these are behaviours that are completely normal for animals. On top of this, it’s easy to spot various references to real scientific papers on the behaviour, appearance, actions and ecology of dinosaurs and other animals in every episode. There might necessarily be some extrapolation and filling in to account for the gaps in the fossil record, but this compelling television is clearly based on real research.And Prehistoric Planet doesn’t just show the inevitable gory scenes, such as a fight to the death between a tyrannosaurus and triceratops; it also gives the animals (and viewers) a chance to breathe and take in the view, whether it’s a swamp, desert or ice field (not just another procession of jungles). Dinosaurs, pterosaurs, plesiosaurs and other ancient animals are not monsters or mythical creatures, but were real (if very odd by today’s standards) living, breathing and behaving creatures interacting in thriving ecosystems.And so it is welcome to see other animals getting their due alongside these great reptiles. The inclusion of frogs, snakes, birds, mammals and ammonites, all set into coherent and realistic environments, makes the programme stand out even more. Although tyrannosaurus, velociraptor and some other household names appear, it’s extremely refreshing to see animals that few people have heard of, from alcione to zalmoxes, as well as numerous animals and landscapes that have never been shown before.We’re finding out more about dinosaurs than ever – but their sex lives still elude us | Dave HoneRead moreScience usually moves on incrementally, and occasionally in major jumps, but public perceptions tend to lag behind. It takes time for new ideas to become mainstream and then to appear on screen. Prehistoric Planet’s real achievement is not just bringing these animals to life, but doing so at the cutting edge of scientific discovery. It shows the public what palaeontologists believe these animals were really like, not just a slightly polished version of what scriptwriters imagine they were.As someone who is actively engaged in research into the biology of dinosaurs and pterosaurs, and in outreach and communication to the public about these animals, I find Prehistoric Planet to be a shining example of bringing them to life. The new series should be appreciated not just for its beautiful cinematography and Attenborough’s narration, but as a bleeding-edge representation of the science of the extinct.

Photograph: Chip Somodevilla/Getty ImagesOpinionEconomic policyThe Guardian view on a death of consensus: politicians are having different nightmaresEditorialInterventions from the Tory chancellor and his Labour shadow spell the end of a period of economic agreement Fri 26 May 2023 18.25 BSTLast modified on Fri 26 May 2023 19.10 BSTDo political parties concur because they agree about their goals or their fears? Phil Tinline argues in his book The Death of Consensus that it is shared nightmares, not aspirations, that create unanimity in politics. This might explain why a new consensus seemed to form earlier this year – personified in the Economist by the character of Ms Heeves, a portmanteau of the Conservative chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, and his Labour shadow, Rachel Reeves.Both politicians were temperamentally unsuited to the radical policy experimentation of their parties under populist leadership. Neither would accept the characterisation that they agreed on much. But faced with an inflationary shock, both Mr Hunt and Ms Reeves retreated to a cosy consensus of sound money, pro-business policies. With an election likely next year, that period of agreement is ending. This is no bad thing.Ms Reeves this week laid out her political dividing lines in a speech and policy paper in Washington. She accurately pinpointed the original sin of austerity. Labour is right to argue that only an activist state can green the economy and dilute harmful corporate concentration. Creating an independent industrial strategy council – disbanded by the Tory government – on a statutory footing is a good idea incubated by the Institute for Public Policy Research. Stronger “collective bargaining rights” to deal with economic insecurity and low pay are also welcome. This is territory that the Tories can only occupy with empty rhetoric.Mr Hunt, by contrast, laid out a Panglossian vision of the UK’s economic success in the pages of the Telegraph last Friday. It is true that Britain, according to the Bank of England, will avoid a recession this year and that the country’s growth prospects have improved. But the Telegraph’s online readers appeared less than impressed – with many seeing Mr Hunt as much a high tax and interventionist politician as his shadow. The chancellor’s sunny take is an attempt to shift that view.Tory voters tell pollsters that the economy is the most important issue facing the country, followed by immigration and then inflation. They seem more convinced than the rest of the country that the prime minister will keep his promise to cut inflation by half. Though it is coming down, the cost of living crisis remains persistent, with grocery prices jumping 19%. But this may not trouble the wealthy Tory base. Owning their homes outright means they are also insulated from the painful medicine of higher interest rates prescribed by the Bank of England, and endorsed by Mr Hunt, to bring the rate of price increases down. A core Conservative vote sees a prize in lower inflation: fiscal space for Mr Hunt to offer them a pre-election giveaway – such as cutting inheritance tax.The Tories and Labour now have different nightmares. The latter’s voters worry that the challenge of inequality remains unspoken. The gains from globalisation-enabled growth were not broadly shared. Not only did regions lose out, but so did lower income groups. No other major European country is as unequal as Britain. The Resolution Foundation calculates that, by one measure of income inequality, the Gini coefficient, Britain in 2027 would be more unequal than the US today. Under Ms Reeves’s fiscal rules, that dismal future could be avoided by levying wealth taxes – and using the money raised to repair public services. Unfortunately, the parameters of political debate remain firmly set to avoid saying this out loud. That must change.TopicsEconomic policyOpinionJeremy HuntRachel ReevesUK cost of living crisisInequalityTax and spendingeditorialsReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedThe Guardian viewColumnistsCartoonsOpinion videosLettersNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The way we feed ourselves is the key determinant of whether we survive this century, as no other sector is as damaging . Yet we can scarcely begin to discuss it objectively, thanks to the power of comforting illusions.Food has the extraordinary property of turning even the most progressive people into reactionaries. People who might accept any number of social and political changes can respond with fury if you propose our diets should shift. Stranger still, there’s a gulf between ultraconservative beliefs about how we should eat and the behaviour of people who hold such beliefs. I have heard people cite a rule formulated by the food writer Michael Pollan – “Don’t eat anything your great-great-great-grandmother wouldn’t recognise as food” – while eating a diet (Thai one day, Mexican the next, Mediterranean the day after) whose range of ingredients no one’s great-great-great-grandmother would recognise, and living much the better for it.Something is blocking us, a deep repression that stands in the way of honest conversation. It pushes food writers, celebrity chefs and some environmentalists to propose answers to the planetary crisis that are even more damaging than the problems they claim to address. Their solutions, such as pasture-fed meat, with its massive land demand , are impossible to scale without destroying remaining wild ecosystems: there is simply not enough planet. What is this inhibition and how does it arise?It’s now a year since I published Regenesis, a book that has incited levels of fury shocking even to me. I’ve spent much of this time trying to work out what makes people so angry. I think it’s because the book challenges what the cognitive historian Jeremy Lent calls a “root metaphor”: an idea so deeply embedded in our minds that it affects our preferences without our conscious knowledge.The root metaphor in this case is exemplified by King Charles III’s love affair with Transylvania, explored recently in the New Statesman. What he found there “was a perfectly bottled model of life before modernity”. “It’s the timelessness which is so important,” the king is reported to have said. “The landscape is almost out of some of those stories you used to read as a child.”Farming in Transylvania looks (or did until recently) just as it “ought” to look: tiny villages where cows with their calves, ducks with their ducklings and cats with their kittens share the dirt road with ruddy-cheeked farmers driving horses and carts; alpine pastures where sheep graze and people scythe the grass and build conical haystacks. In other words, as the king remarked, it looks like a children’s book.Making hay for animal feed in Zalánpatak, Transylvania, Romania. Photograph: JasonBerlin/AlamyA remarkable number of books for pre-literate children are about livestock farms. The farms they imagine look nothing like the industries that produce the meat, dairy and eggs we eat, which are generally places of horror. The stories they tell are a version of an ancient idyll of herders with their animals, built across thousands of years in pastoral poetry and religious traditions. Livestock farming in this idyll is a place of safety, harmony and comfort, into which we subconsciously burrow at times of unease.Much of the discussion of food and farming in public life looks like an effort to recreate that happy place. As a result, many of the proposed solutions to the global food crisis seek, in effect, to revive medieval production systems – to feed a 21st-century population. It cannot end well.For instance, there’s now a foodie obsession with hyper-free range chicken farming. Chickens, the new romantics propose, should follow grazing cattle, eating the insects that feed on their dung. As in the children’s books, farm animals of different species interact. But the chicken is a non-native, omnivorous bird of the pheasant family. Just as we begin to recognise the damage caused by the release of pheasants into the countryside – they work through baby snakes, frogs, caterpillars, spiders, seedlings – the nostalgists seek to do the same with chickens. To the extent that chickens feed themselves in such systems, they mop up wildlife. In reality, they can’t survive this way, so they continue to be fed on soy, often produced on former rainforest and Cerrado savanna in Brazil.This is what happens when people see the pictures and not the numbers. A scene that reminds us of our place of safety at the dawning of consciousness is used as the model for how we should be fed, regardless of whether it can scale. Bucolic romanticism might seem harmless. But it leads, if enacted, to hunger, ecological destruction or both, on a vast scale. Our arcadian fantasies devour the planet.Embrace what may be the most important green technology ever. It could save us all | George MonbiotRead moreStorybook farming never worked as the romantics claim. Widespread meat-eating in the 19th century became possible only through the colonisation and clearance of Australia and the Americas and the creation, largely by the British empire, of a global system sucking meat into rich nations. The cattle and sheep ranching that supplied our supposedly traditional diet drove the dispossession of Indigenous people and destruction of ecosystems on a massive scale, a process that continues to this day. When you challenge the story that masks these grim realities, it’s perceived as an attack on our very identity.Real solutions to our global food crises are neither beautiful nor comforting. They inevitably involve factories, and we all hate factories, don’t we? In reality, almost everything we eat has passed through at least one factory (probably several) on its way to our plates. We are in deep denial about this, which is why, in the US, where 95% of the population eats meat, a survey found that 47% wanted to ban slaughterhouses.The answer is not more fields, which means destroying even more wild ecosystems. It is partly better, more compact, cruelty-free and pollution-free factories. Among the best options, horror of horrors, is a shift from farming multicellular organisms (plants and animals) to farming unicellular creatures (microbes), which allows us to do far more with far less.King Charles would doubtless hate this. But there are 8 billion people to feed and a planet to restore, and neither can be achieved with retentive fantasies. I’ve found myself contesting a cruel, polluting and self-destructive mainstream farming model on one hand and, on the other, an idyllic reverie that would lead us to the twin disaster of agricultural sprawl and world hunger. It’s hard to decide which is worse.

Especially in a democracy as old and bodged-about as Britain, with its centuries of alterations to the electorate and yet its tendency to see each new set of arrangements as somehow natural, eternal and wise.Beneath the self-congratulation and claims of political neutrality, however, the shape of the electorate is always the product of power struggles, which are no less intense for often being hidden from sight. How adult, or how British, you need to be to have a say in how the country is governed: these are contested issues in an ever more fluid world.They are made more contentious still by political parties. For self-interested and philosophical reasons, Labour and the Tories have long had different ideas about who should be included in the electorate and who should be left out. For more than half a century, governments of both parties have redrawn its boundaries, sometimes to their considerable advantage.Keir Starmer’s recent suggestion that 16- and 17-year-olds should be given the vote in England and Northern Ireland (they already have it in Scotland and Wales for local and devolved elections) and that EU citizens living in the UK be allowed to vote in general elections (rather than only in local ones), provoked a tellingly furious response from the Conservatives and their press allies. Labour was accused of seeking to “rig the voting system”, and of “a plot to reverse Brexit”.Labour considers plans to let EU nationals and 16-year-olds voteRead moreIn some ways, the outrage was unjustified. Reversing Brexit is not likely to be Labour policy any time soon, and accusing the party of trying to rig elections seems rich coming from a government that has just introduced a voter ID law for precisely that reason, as the increasingly loose-tongued former minister Jacob Rees-Mogg admitted last week. Faced with multiplying enemies, the Tories’ unsubtle plan seems to be to give their narrow support more weight by making it harder for others to vote.Yet Starmer’s Tory critics were right about the potential importance of his proposals. His plan would add about 6.5 million people to the electorate, increasing it by 14%. And most of those new voters would probably not be Tories, given that Labour beat the Conservatives by 43 percentage points among 18- to 24-year-olds at the last election; and given how badly the government has treated Britain’s EU residents since Brexit. If Labour takes power and expands the electorate, comfortable Tory general election victories could become extremely rare. Even under the current system, they have had only one since 1987.Contemplating such large-scale shifts feels unfamiliar, even like a form of wishful thinking, because since at least the 90s, so much of our politics has been about the opposite: the targeting of small numbers of swing voters. Our first past the post system, the emphasis on marginal seats, and the ever greater precision of political research and marketing, all mean that winning elections is about gaining lots of small advantages – or so we are told by an industry of strategists, pollsters and focus group analysts.Yet Britain also has a largely forgotten history of less reactive, more ambitious approaches to the electorate. It arguably began in 1969, when the Labour government of Harold Wilson – in whose strong election-winning record Starmer takes a keen interest – reduced the voting age from 21 to 18. Cabinet supporters of the change argued that older teenagers were effectively adults; and also that giving them the vote “will channel their political energies into regular forms of political activity and away from the kind of violent demonstration in which students have recently been indulging” – the famous 1968 uprisings. Today’s 16- and 17 year-olds are not rioting yet, despite having almost their entire lives blighted by Tory austerity; but giving them the vote might make that less likely.Labour almost certainly gained from lowering the voting age. They won two of the next three elections. In October 1974, the first contest for which age-related voting data is available, almost twice as many 18- to 24-year-olds chose them as the Tories: a crucial factor in a narrow victory. Yet after the Conservatives returned to office in 1979, they initiated their own politically advantageous expansion of the electorate: giving expats the vote for the first time.Treating people living abroad as legitimate participants in domestic politics suggested that the Tories were not yet ready to give up on the old imperial idea that Britain was a global nation. It also reflected a common assumption that expats were rightwing: people who had left the country to make more money, pay lower taxes and escape postwar Britain’s supposedly stifling egalitarianism. Letting them register as “overseas voters” in the British constituencies where they had last lived was attacked by Labour as “international gerrymandering”. But the Tories ignored the accusation, and then extended how long expats could retain a vote in Britain from five to 20 years. At the 1992 election, the first after this change, it was estimated that about two-thirds of them backed the Conservatives.Nowadays, thanks largely to Brexit, expats are less likely to be Tories. Yet the questionable nature of letting people have a say over how Britain is governed without feeling some or any of the consequences remains. And so does the Conservative desire to harvest expat votes. Last year, the same Elections Act that introduced ID requirements for British residents who want to choose the rulers and policies that directly affect them included a less-noticed provision for expats to remotely enjoy “votes for life” in Britain. The government estimates that 3.5 million people could join the electorate. The legislation is expected to take effect in time for the next election.If Labour wins anyway, it is not guaranteed that the party will also widen the electorate. Since making his controversial suggestion about doing so Starmer has, typically, hedged his bets, saying that Labour has “no settled policy”.In Scotland and Wales, left-leaning parties have done well in elections since 16- and 17-year-olds were given the vote. The policy is supported by the SNP, the Lib Dems, the Greens and Plaid Cymru. Teenagers may not always make the most mature voters, but as the support from much older Britons for Brexit and a succession of poor Tory prime ministers has shown, advancing age and political wisdom don’t necessarily go together. It’s time for Labour to make Britain a younger democracy again.

Photograph: Luca Bruno/APOpinionDroughtThe Guardian view on water politics in Europe: a new fault lineEditorialAs drought beacomes the norm, creative solutions must be found to deal with a new, parched realityFri 26 May 2023 18.30 BSTLast modified on Fri 26 May 2023 19.11 BSTIn April, Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, suggested that severe drought would become “one of the central political and territorial debates of our country in the coming years”. That stark warning surely applies to southern Europe as a whole, as the prospect of another summer crisis looms, following a disastrously dry winter.An absence of melting snow from the Alps has left Italy’s Po River as shallow as during last year’s searingly hot summer. In January and February, France recorded the highest number of rain-free days since records began, and water restrictions are in place in the Pyrénées-Orientales region. About 90% of mainland Portugal is suffering from drought, judged to be severe in one-fifth of the country. In Spain, from Catalonia to Andalucía, unseasonable heat has contributed to reservoirs drying up and a disastrous drop in olive oil production. By the middle of this month, southern Spain had received barely 30% of expected rainfall. As temperatures continue to rise, and Europe warms faster than the global average, drought across vast swathes of territory is simply becoming the norm.There are obvious moves that can be made to alleviate water shortages. A quarter of drinking water in Europe is lost because of leaky pipelines. In Italy – one of the worst offenders in this respect – a drought taskforce has been created to improve water infrastructure. In France, Emmanuel Macron has set a 10% water savings target for all sectors of the economy by 2030 and demanded far greater reuse of wastewater. New, low-energy desalination techniques will be key to guaranteeing future supplies of water for human consumption.There is, however, no foreseeable technical fix that will allow difficult decisions over an increasingly scarce resource to be evaded. The politics of a new, parched reality will be fraught and contested, particularly in relation to food production in transformed terrain. In France, plans for new reservoirs to irrigate farmland have led to violent clashes between police and environmental protesters, who argue that agricultural practices need to become less water-intensive.In Andalucía, regional proposals to legalise irrigation in part of the Doñana Natural Space – one the world’s most important wetlands – have become a wedge issue ahead of local elections this weekend. Vox, a far-right party which has made political gains through downplaying the severity of the climate emergency, has positioned itself as a champion of the strawberry farmers who would benefit from the plans. In Seville, thousands have demonstrated against the project, which has been condemned by both Madrid and the European Commission.Global heating will eventually force rural economies such as those in Andalucía to diversify to survive. They will require substantial assistance from both national governments and the European Union to do so. More needs to be done to help those who find themselves at the sharp end of an emerging crisis for agricultural production. An absence of proper economic support will breed dangerous resentment in regions that have traditionally prided themselves on supplying Europe’s fruit, vegetable and cereal needs.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Sue Gough, a Department of Defense spokesperson, told Digital that a training course was going on at that time, and the Pentagon's office that tracks UAPs, a government-derived acronym that means UFO, doesn't have any record of this incident.   FOOTAGE OF UFOS OVER CONFLICT ZONES SEEN FOR FIRST TIME: ‘THIS IS DEVASTATING’    A potential UFO was seen flying over a U.S. Marine base in 2021. The photo was obtained by Jeremy Corbell, who shared it with Digital. (@Jeremycorbell/WeaponizedPodcast.com)""I can confirm that there were military aviation assets in the Twentynine Palms, California, airspace and a Weapons and Tactics Instructor Course was being conducted at the time,"" Gough said in an email.""There is no record of communication with the base range control concerning a UAP sighting, nor of the allocation of any base resources to investigate a UAP sighting.  AARO does not have a record of this alleged event and cannot verify the authenticity of the report.""   ‘MOSUL ORB’: US SILENT ON UFO FILMED BY MILITARY OVER IRAQThe sighting was seen from Camp Wilson, a 998-square-mile installation at the southern tip of San Bernardino County in the Mojave Desert, making it the largest Marine Corps base in the world. Most of the base is set aside for training.   AARO, which stands for All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office, is an office within the Department of Defense that has been tasked with investigating and identifying unidentified flying objects and other phenomena in the air, sea or space.     In videos that Corbell and his ""WeaponizedPodcast.com"" co-host, reporter George Knapp, released, voices can be heard asking what the object is. Another voice is heard saying, ""We got aliens."" VideoThe duo examined photos and videos of the incident during the May 23 episode of their podcast, and played interviews with unidentified witnesses who said they're Marines. ""Two years ago, this thing happened and nothing has come out,"" Knapp said on the podcast. ""There’s been no media coverage in two years since.""    UFO SENATE HEARING: PENTAGON OFFICIAL ‘CONCERNED’ ABOUT CHINA AND RUSSIA'S ‘ADVANCED TECH’Even though AARO doesn't have a record of this incident, according to Gough, it highlights what Corbell and lawmakers have said is a glaring oversight in reporting potential UFO sightings.After the April 19 UFO hearing in front of the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities, Sens. Mark Warner, D-Va., and Marco Rubio, R-Fla., wrote a five-bullet-point letter to the Department of Defense, which was obtained by Digital.     A picture of a possible UFO over a Marine base, dubbed ""The Mojave Triangle,"" was obtained by Jeremy Corbell and shared with Digital. (@Jeremycorbell/WeaponizedPodcast.com)One of the arguments was the lack of a secure way for potential UFO witnesses to safely come forward and share their stories.     ""To date, we have seen no efforts to communicate the existence of the secure process to the public,"" the senators said in their letter. ""We request that you provide us an update on the plan to publicize the secure process for witnesses to come forward.""UFO SEARCH: RETIRED NAVY SENIOR CHIEF ‘NOT GOING TO JAIL’ TO REPORT WHAT HE SAW IN AFGHANISTAN  Rubio told Digital in an emailed statement that Americans ""are understandably concerned"" about objects in the country's airspace and near facilities. ""What’s worse, our government spent too many years ignoring or downplaying the threat,"" Rubio said. ""Thankfully, that is beginning to change, but as we saw earlier this year, the defense and intelligence communities are still struggling.""  WATCH CORBELL TALK TO WITNESSES OF THE 2021 INCIDENT (FROM WEAPONIZEDPODCAST.COM)   VideoThe Florida senator was referring to the Chinese spy balloon and three other UAPs that the Biden administration shot down in February. For now, Corbell and Knapp continue to essentially be witnesses' mouthpieces as they investigate tips, photos and videos. He called this particular case ""an open UFO investigation"" and said they are crowdsourcing for additional footage and witness testimony.     ""We encourage additional service members that were at the Twentynine Palms/Camp Wilson installation during this reported event to come forward with additional footage, images or information,"" Corbell said. ""The truth is out there, but without a proper and defined flow of information by the Department of Defense, we will not be able to make progress on understanding the UFO presence on planet Earth and what it means for humanity.""

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.Two Pennsylvania parents are facing charges after their children were found living in deplorable conditions alongside caged rats and other animals in a home outside of Philadelphia, a report says.     Shane Robertson, 47, and Crystal Robertson, 37, are each facing seven counts of endangering the welfare of children after police responded to a property in West Rockhill Township on April 23, according to WPVI. The children, who range in age from 4 to 16 years old, were described by Crystal Robertson as ""garbage disposals with legs,"" the station reported, citing a police affidavit.   The document also said the mother told investigators a refrigerator inside the home was secured with a padlock because the children had been ""stealing"" food from it, WPVI added.   FAMILIES OF 4 PENNSYLVANIA MEN GUNNED DOWN, BURIED ON FARM, SETTLE WRONGFUL DEATH LAWSUIT     The Pennridge Regional Police Department said Thursday in a news release that the Roberstons' children were found on April 23. (Pennridge Regional Police Department)The Pennridge Regional Police Department discovered the alleged conditions on April 23 after a caller reported seeing children enter an abandoned trailer in their neighborhood. In a news release Thursday, police said they found a 12-year-old girl who told responding officers she was taking a blanket to keep her rats warm, according to WPVI. Then police reportedly spotted a 14-year-old wearing dirty clothes.   The officers then brought both children to the Robertsons, who live next door, and returned later with an official from Bucks County Children and Youth, WPVI reported. Inside the home, police found four children hidden in a rear bedroom, around two dozen caged rats, dogs, snakes and feces in numerous locations, the station says.   FUGITIVE WANTED FOR SEX ASSAULT, KIDNAPPING IN ALLEGED MULTISTATE CRIME SPREE IS CAUGHT AFTER ‘DAYS-LONG MANHUNT’       The children found by the Pennridge Regional Police Department are now in protective custody, a report said. The children, who were living in ""unsanitary and essentially unsafe"" conditions, were ultimately taken into protective custody, according to WPVI, citing the police statement. The children reportedly were found to be suffering from medical conditions including malnourishment and low kidney function, while one had maggots in her hair. Other children had their heads shaved due to severe matting, while some needed ""extensive"" dental treatment, the report said, citing police.     Police also learned the children did not attend school and several of them did not know their own birthdays, the station added.  Both Robertsons are now free Friday after posting ten percent of $100,000 bail, WPVI reports.   The Pennridge Regional Police Department did not immediately respond to a request from Digital for comment.       Greg Norman is a reporter at Digital.

""It was definitely scary, but I felt it was important to be vulnerable and show other girls that they can open up and that they're not alone in this,"" Isabelle Eacrett, a 19-year-old Alabama student and sorority member featured in the film, told Digital.The University of Alabama is the top recruitment school in the country, with prospective sorority members going so far as to hire recruitment specialists to help them get into certain houses.  Rush consultant Trisha Addicks, who is featured in the new HBO Max documentary, described the rush process at Alabama as ""cutthroat.""  NORTH CAROLINA CAMPUS SECURITY OFFICER GOES VIRAL FOR HUGGING GRADUATING SENIORS BEFORE COMMENCEMENT    The University of Alabama is the top recruitment school in the country, with prospective sorority members going so far as to hire recruitment specialists to help them get into certain houses. (""Bama Rush""/ HBO Max)""It's just uniquely Alabama,"" she said.Prospective new members (PNMs) go through an intensive, four-round recruitment process, which includes interviews and social functions, before they choose a sorority and vice versa. Some students opt out of Greek life because of the cost alone.  91-YEAR-OLD NEW YORK CROSSING GUARD RETIRES AFTER 41 YEARS: 'MY LIFE FEELS SO COMPLETE'The average annual cost of rushing for new sorority members at Alabama is more than $8,000, according to the documentary. Tuition for in-state students is less than $12,000 annually, and about $30,000 annually for out-of-state students.    ""It was definitely scary, but I felt it was important to be vulnerable and show other girls that they can open up and that they're not alone in this,"" Isabelle Eacrett, a 19-year-old Alabama student and sorority member, told Digital. (""Bama Rush""/ HBO Max)After all four rounds of the rush process, PNMs who do not fit a sorority’s expectations may get ""dropped,"" meaning they have to turn to their second, third or even last choices.    HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR WHO WENT VIRAL FOR 'RECORD' $10M IN SCHOLARSHIP OFFERS MAKES FINAL COLLEGE DECISIONThe documentary, which features four students' ""rush week"" experiences, comes after ""#Bamarush"" videos went viral on TikTok last year as students posted videos of their outfits and ""rush"" advice that generated billions of views on the video-sharing app.However, Eacrett says the film is about more than what students portray on TikTok. ""I believe sorority life is more than what people think. … It has less to do with outfits and appearances and more so to do with your journey as a person.""    ""A lot of people don't recognize how smart these girls are and how important academics are in Greek life, especially in the South. It has a lot to do with your acts of service, philanthropy and sisterhood, obviously.""15 OF THE WILDEST, WACKIEST COLLEGE CLASSES TAUGHT IN AMERICA TODAYThe documentary also highlights an air of mystery and tradition surrounding Alabama’s Greek life system. A ""secret"" society made up of certain sororities and fraternities on campus called The Machine, for example, apparently controls high-level decisions at the some-38,000-student school.  Some women featured in the film discuss a lack of individuality in the rush process, saying PNMs should stand out, but only to an extent. They should be unique but not entirely different from the other women they are seeking to join.      The documentary highlights an air of mystery and tradition surrounding Alabama’s Greek life system. (""Bama Rush""/ HBO Max)Author Elizabeth Boyd described the process as ""a proving ground of competitive femininity and the contemporary performance of the Southern belle.""One student featured in the documentary, Shelby Rose, stopped filming with HBO halfway through. She said HBO approached her when she was a senior in high school entering her freshman year at Alabama, and she thought the documentary was going to be different from what it ultimately ended up becoming.   VIRGINIA DAD, A VETERAN, GRADUATES FROM COLLEGE ALONGSIDE HIS DAUGHTER""I love every single sorority at UA, and I have nothing but positive things to say about the campus and the sororities,"" she said in a TikTok explaining her decision to stop filming. ""So, since I did stop filming, like, right before rush week, and I feel as blindsided and confused as everybody else. … I do not agree with any of the negative things said about the University of Alabama, campus as a whole and the UA Panhellenic Association.""  She said she has ""lost trust"" in the film's creators because ""it was portrayed in a very different way"" to her when she signed on to be featured in it.  Eacrett, meanwhile, says she was happy with how the documentary turned out. ""A lot of people didn't understand what the documentary was going to be. I think people expected it to be some exposé or exposing secrets of sorority life, and if anyone hasn't seen the documentary, I encourage them to delve in with the idea that this is more than that,"" she said. ""This is stories of young women, and I hope people gain insight on what it's really like to be a young woman in our age, with social media, with pressure coming from all directions.""    She added that she thinks ""a lot of people wanted was some hard-hitting piece on the secrets."" What they got instead was a movie meant to ""uplift girls and to show what they're really going through.""  Audrey Conklin is a digital reporter for Digital and FOX Business.

Texas residents share how familiar they are with artificial intelligence on a scale from one to 10 and detailed how much they use it each day.NEWYou can now listen to articles!   The ""Godfather of A.I.,"" Geoffrey Hinton, quit Google out of fear that his former employer intends to deploy artificial intelligence in ways that will harm human beings. ""It is hard to see how you can prevent the bad actors from using it for bad things,"" Hinton recently told The New York Times.      But stomping out the door does nothing to atone for his own actions, and it certainly does nothing to protect conservatives – who are the primary target of A.I. programmers – from being canceled.  Here are five things to know as the battle over A.I. turns hot:    FAKE PENTAGON EXPLOSION IMAGE GOES VIRAL ON TWITTER, SPARKING FURTHER AI CONCERNS  1. Google’s new monopoly on ""Truth"" Elon Musk recently revealed that Google co-founder Larry Page and other Silicon Valley leaders want AI to establish a ""digital god"" that ""would understand everything in the world. … [A]nd give you back the exact ‘right’ thing instantly."" It is hard to imagine anything more dangerous to a pluralistic, democratic Republic than a single dispenser of ""truth.""      The Biden administration has seen the potential of AI to push its political message.  (JOSEP LAGO/AFP via Getty Images)That nobody has a monopoly on truth is the prerequisite for pluralism. But pluralism is what authoritarians abhor and what AI tech executives cannot tolerate. Conservatives have already seen how Big Tech censors and cancels us based on our beliefs and political viewpoints. AI is being turbocharged to do this in limitless ways.  2. Brainwashing is no longer science fiction Americans are just beginning to understand that the dangers of AI go far beyond economic disruption. They also go beyond silencing speech. The newest gadgets being powered by AI now permit tech companies to capture our most intimate thoughts and our most sensitive data. They have already begun to map our minds, so they can manipulate our thoughts.   Duke Law professor Nita Farahany (a biologist, philosopher and human rights attorney) has been sounding the alarm, explaining how the Chinese government is using AI to analyze facial expressions and brain waves to punish those who are not faithful communists.  Using similar technology, U.S. tech companies may be able to hack into the minds of users to steal PIN codes, according to Farahany. They are also tracking brain waves via sensors embedded in watches and headphones which can determine which political messages are most persuasive to a user.     VideoAI will soon empower lying politicians to deceive more voters than ever before. When Farahany tried to explain these dangers at the World Economic Forum, the snobs of Davos applauded enthusiastically. They see AI’s dangers as an asset.      3. The GOP is truly the Grand OLD Party Republicans in Congress who are even talking about AI are focusing on how many nurses and truck drivers might lose their jobs, not about the serious threat AI poses to the very essence of who we are as humans. Economic disruption is most assuredly going to happen, but Republicans are missing the profound implications to liberty.   In the first AI hearing held by the House Innovation Subcommittee this year, Big Tech lobbyists admitted that self-driving car manufacturers would gobble up every imaginable bit of data ""for our own safety"" but assured the committee that they would endeavor not to share this data with other companies. Shockingly, nobody asked the obvious: what assurances do we have that these companies will not use this data against their own customers?  You’d think that the lessons of Big Tech censorship would draw every Republican into the AI fight. That has not happened yet.      Americans are just beginning to understand that the dangers of AI go far beyond economic disruption. They also go beyond silencing speech.  4. Democrats have us where they want us Democrats in the Biden administration and in Congress have a much better understanding that AI is the greatest tool they’ve ever had to socialize America. Many are pretending to call for a pause to AI development while stomping on the accelerator to develop it as fast as possible.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTERHere's reality: the Biden administration has already pledged to spend $140 million to establish seven AI research institutes, and it just created the National Artificial Intelligence Advisory Committee to chart ""a path for responsible and inclusive AI."" Even more telling, the Biden White House has indicated to it will direct federal agencies to ""use AI tools"" in their work. Nary a pause in the Dems' use of AI can be found.   5. But failure is not an option Communist China just released regulations mandating that AI be programmed to reflect ""socialist core values"" and avoid information that could undermine ""state power.""      CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThe Chinese government and other authoritarians seek to harness this new technological power for control of information and the masses. They will use it extensively in warfare, too.    The trick is to lead the development of AI globally while enforcing appropriate guardrails to prevent the left from attacking our freedoms. The window to achieve both is small and shrinking.    Dan Schneider is vice president of MRC Free Speech America                      Get the recap of top opinion commentary and original content throughout the week.

""It's time to pay."" Those four words from Missouri Democrat Rep. Cori Bush are being heard a lot by Democratic politicians across the country this month. For Bush, the debt amounts to $14 trillion in reparations for Black Americans.     In California, activists are demanding as much as $5 million per Black resident and asking Gov. Gavin Newsom ""where's the money?"" One member of Newsom's Reparations Task Force demanded that the state pay its ""sin bill"" In New York and Chicago, mayors are balking at towering costs from migrants being shipped from the border to their ""sanctuary"" cities.   CA REPARATIONS TASK FORCE MEMBER DEFENDS MILLION-DOLLAR PAYOUTS: 'SIN BILL' FOR 'TERRORIZING BLACK PEOPLE'  In Tampa, after demanding $3 million per Black resident, a witness said that he and others were putting ""White people on notice that we want our reparations."" Bills are coming due after years of political campaigning on these issues.     Reverend Tony Pierce calls for millions of dollars in reparations for each Black Californian at a meeting of the California Reparations Task Force on May 6, 2023. (YouTube screenshot from California Department of Justice channel)Reparations and sanctuary cities have long been the bread and butter of identity politics. For years, Democratic politicians have campaigned on these ""moral imperatives"" in passing sanctuary laws and setting up reparation task forces.   It is the equivalent of a compounding interest on credit card debt. Each election Democrats used these issues for short-term political gains. Now those bills are coming due and Democratic leaders are balking.   President Joe Biden and Congress are in a potentially lethal game of chicken over the looming default over our debt. It would not seem an ideal time to demand an additional $14 trillion, but Bush declared, ""Black people in our country cannot wait any longer."" She was joined by members like Reps. Barbara Lee, D-CA, Jamaal Bowman, D-NY, and Rashida Tlaib, D-MI. It is a view being voiced across the country by Black citizens who were told that these payments are an undeniable moral obligation. The years of politicking on the issue have created a sense of entitlement to large cash payments. As one well-known California activist declared: ""It’s a debt that’s owed, we worked for free. We’re not asking; we’re telling you.""    VideoNewsom recently balked at the payment of the reparations recommended by his own task force, though he has indicated that some cash payments may still be made. Newsom attempted the long-expected pivot and said, rather plaintively, that dealing with the legacy of slavery ""is about much more than cash payments."" It may be too late for that spin. Recent polling shows 77 percent of Black Americans now support reparations – a stark increase in recent years.     Task Force member Rev. Amos Brown said that they will not except any excuses and that the state has to commit to the full amount and, if needed, ""pay for it over installments."" The late New York governor Mario Cuomo famously said that politicians campaign in poetry, but they govern in prose. However, the ""prose"" of many Democratic leaders is not winning any prizes. While many have denounced the busing of migrants to sanctuary cities, most privately admit that there is an element of poetic justice. For years, these cities have told undocumented migrants that they are welcome to come to their cities where they would be protected. Then they showed up. It was a political version of ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner,"" the movie about a liberal couple who is confronted with a visit of their daughter and her Black fiance.       Los Angeles long-time resident, Walter Foster, age 80, holds up a sign as the Reparations Task Force meets to hear public input on reparations at the California Science Center in Los Angeles on Sept. 22, 2022.  (Carolyn Cole / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images)The single most riveting moment came at Martha's Vineyard where residents came out to clap and wave to the migrants ... as they were shipped to a military base off the island. New York City has been shipping migrants to other cities, which are going to court to stop the relocation. Many of these towns point out that, unlike New York City, they have never declared themselves a sanctuary for undocumented persons. Even though these cities have been sent a fraction of the influx of states like Texas, mayors in sanctuary cities like Chicago have expressed outage. As with those expecting reparations, these migrants are understandably confused. They were told that Chicago was a ""ciudad santuario."" Chicago reaffirmed this status in 2022 when it extended protections and benefits.    At the time, politicians scrambled for cameras to declare, as did Alderwoman Rossana Rodríguez, that Chicago must be ""a welcoming city for immigrants"" and reaffirmed that ""our city is responsible for acting with solidarity towards the people that are the most marginalized and the most impacted by a system that oppresses them.""     Task Force member Rev. Amos Brown said that they will not except any excuses and that the state has to commit to the full amount and, if needed, ""pay for it over installments.""  Then they showed up in greater numbers and the former mayor Lori Lightfoot demanded that the migrants be sent elsewhere or kept in border towns overwhelmed by far greater numbers of migrants. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER  In some cases, there is no alternative but to try to quietly abandon prior campaigns that generated acclaim nationally and caused serious damage locally. For example, some of us criticized cities like San Francisco for declaring a boycott of states which did not adhere to their views on issues like transgender rights.  I noted at the time that the boycott would cost the city dearly in cutting off 22 states by driving up costs. It did, and the city quietly rescinded the boycott after losing millions. While the media paid far less attention to the rescission than the original decision, other reversals have come at a greater political cost to the left.   For example, cities that led efforts to defund the police are now refunding the police after soaring crime rates and high levels of police retirements and resignations. Activists in cities like Los Angeles called it a ""slap in the face"" given years of promises from Democratic politicians.   CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPIn the meantime, Newsom's task force has demanded an assortment of other changes, including eliminating cash bail, abandoning the prosecution of certain crimes, subsidizing home purchases for Black residents, guaranteeing a ""right to return"" by taking over development projects to guarantee Black housing ownership. Some of those reforms can be finessed by politicians, but there is no spin that will obscure the absence of a cash payment.   These are the creditors of the Democratic Party, and they seem now intent on collecting on compounded interest of years of identity politics.     A version of this blog previously appeared on Jonathan Turley's blog. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE JONATHAN TURLEY   Jonathan Turley is the Shapiro professor of public interest law at George Washington University and a practicing criminal defense attorney.

Tim Scott, R-S.C., discusses 2024 presidential run and how he plans on winning the nomination.NEWYou can now listen to articles!   It's common among the conservative Twitterati to joke that the leftist media really want former President Donald Trump to be the nominee again, assuming -- as they did in 2016 -- that it means doom for the Republicans.    But whoever prevails, the 2024 Republican primary cycle is going to work out like all modern-day cycles. Inevitably, liberal Democrat reporters are going to end up loading buckets of slime and unloading them on every half-plausible candidate on the Republican side of the campaign. Even John McCain learned the hard way that his media pals would turn on him when it counted. VideoOn Monday, May 22, Sen. Tim Scott announced he was running for president, the only Black Republican in the Senate. The Left desperately wants to cartoon the Republican electorate as a pack of white supremacists, so Scott has to be mocked as the worst kind of African American.  REPUBLICAN SEN. TIM SCOTT FILES TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT IN 2024  MSNBC host Rachel Maddow, now the laziest host in cable news -- she only works Mondays -- mocked Scott's vocal delivery. ""That was a rough first three seconds of his presidential campaign,"" said Maddow, laughing. ""But who knows? Maybe it was just a rough first couple of seconds. Maybe in the end, he will do great. It worked out great for Peter Brady, in the end. He got through it. It was tough.""  So far, the GOP presidential field already contains two Black men and two Indian Americans, but Republicans are still hopelessly racist, because any Republican ‘of color’ is cartooned as a self-loathing Clarence Thomas, a token desperate for White approval. Maddow compared a 57-year-old Black man to a teenage white boy going through puberty. It's not hard to guess how this would have been greeted if someone mocked the Almighty Barack this way. It would be racist.PROLIFIC FUNDRAISER TIM SCOTT HAULS IN $2 MILLION IN FIRST 24 HOURS OF HIS 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN  Then there are the pompous pundettes on ABC's ""The View,"" lecturing Scott that he can't possibly run for president based on optimism about America's racial situation. Sunny Hostin waved him off: ""I don't know who his message is supposed to resonate with, actually. He's talking about victimhood and personal responsibility as if people aren't taking responsibility for their own actions."" Whoopi Goldberg echoed, ""He came out and did that dog whistle: victimhood."" VideoHostin said being a successful Black man is rare: ""He is the exception, and not the rule. And until he is the rule, then he can stop talking about systemic racism."" You can either agree America's a systemic racist cesspool, or you can shut up. Goldberg dropped the bomb: ""He's got Clarence Thomas Syndrome.""  CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER    Who is really demeaning Black Americans in this debate? Apparently, racial pessimism is forever.Journalists will also make routine fun of Scott's Christianity. Washington Post political reporter Ben Terris tweeted on Announcement Day, ""Tim Scott will be the first prez candidate I've ever asked about the status of his virginity."" A few years ago, lifelong bachelor Scott coyly answered Terris that the ship had sailed, but he insisted adultery was a sin. Why ask? Because Scott used to preach abstinence before marriage, which apparently opens the door to invasive personal questions. So, if Kamala Harris is pro-choice, has Terris asked her how many abortions she's had? Or how many she's funded, since she's so pro-abortion?

Iran has not declared whether it has a nuclear weapon because the 'costs of doing so would outweigh the benefits'            By         Benjamin Weinthal   |       Video Iran making progress on nuclear facility deep underground  ' Jennifer Griffin reports from the Pentagon on worrisome progress being made on deep underground Iranian nuclear facility.JERUSALEM — Iran has moved dangerously close to enriching weapons-grade uranium for a nuclear bomb, but the regime has not yet crossed the critical threshold of declaring it has built an atomic weapon.     Digital reached out to experts on Iran’s more than two-decade effort to join the small group of countries that have atomic weapons for explanations about what is stopping Tehran from crossing the nuclear threshold. ""If there is reason to believe that there are a number of retardants that have put a pause in their weapons development, they’d relate back to targeted attacks by the U.S. and Israel, who clearly are very much concerned about stopping the mullahs,"" stated Lisa Daftari, an Iran expert and editor-in-chief of the Foreign Desk.  Daftari added, ""Israel has reportedly conducted at least two dozen targeted operations on Iran’s regime in the last 15 or so years, including drone attacks, cyberattacks, if you recall Stuxnet and assassinations of key players in Iran’s nuclear program.""

Otherwise, when there is consistent and targeted pressure on Iran’s regime in the form of enforced sanctions and economic and political isolation, we see a weakened regime and an emboldened Iranian people who are brave enough to take to the streets,"" she said.  Kamal Kharrazi, a senior adviser to the Supreme Leader of Iran’s regime, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, boasted last year that ""Iran is on the nuclear threshold, and this is not something secret,"" according to a 2022 report in the state-controlled Tehran Times.Just this year, the International Atomic Energy Agency revealed Iran’s regime enriched 84% purity of uranium, 6% shy of the 90% enriched uranium required for a nuclear weapon.

Israel views Tehran’s atomic weapon program as an existential threat because Tehran has frequently declared it seeks to obliterate it.    ""It’s an open question as to whether Khamenei wants to die as the father of the Shiite atomic bomb or as the one who kept the Islamic Republic on the nuclear path without provoking a war or pulling the trigger,"" Behnam Ben Taleblu, senior fellow and Iran expert at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told Digital.""Currently, however, Khamenei’s perception of diplomatic and security policy success abroad and ascendency at all costs at home may be sufficient to push him over the edge as he continues to age,"" added Taleblu, who recently authored a comprehensive assessment of Iran's ballistic missile capabilities and intentions.Digital reported this week that Iran is burrowing deep into tunnels near a peak of the Zagros Mountains in central Iran to shield a nuclear facility from conventional weapon attacks.       This file photo released Nov. 5, 2019, by the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, shows centrifuge machines in the Natanz uranium enrichment facility in central Iran. (Atomic Energy Organization of Iran via AP, File)Aside from the technological impediments for the construction of a modern nuclear weapon, Iran’s regime has been confronted with deterrence from Israel and the United States over the years, including Stuxnet computer worm sabotage of the regime’s nuclear fuel production system.""I think Iran's leadership to date has calculated the costs of doing so would outweigh the benefits at this juncture — mainly a destructive attack which targets its entire nuclear infrastructure,"" Jason Brodsky, policy director of the U.S.-based United Against a Nuclear Iran (UANI), told Digital. ISRAEL'S DEFENSE CHIEF WARNS TEHRAN AGAINST FURTHER NUCLEAR DEVELOPMENT: 'WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO HIT IRAN'    National security adviser Jake Sullivan speaks during a press briefing at the White House March 22, 2022. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)""But my concern is that calculus risks changing as the U.S. and Europe's non-response to Iran's nuclear escalation over the last two years — for example 60% enrichment and production of uranium metal — has emboldened Tehran's leadership to continue testing international red lines.""    Brodsky added that ""If that perception is not altered, Iran is likely to enrich uranium to weapons-grade levels at 90%. Tehran's risk-aversion to date shows that it can be deterred. But that can quickly change if the Islamic Republic receives no pushback as it advances its nuclear program.""Earlier this month U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said in a speech to the Washington Institute for Near East Policy that the Biden administration had ""Made it clear to Iran that it can never be permitted to obtain a nuclear weapon. As President Biden has repeatedly reaffirmed, he will take the actions that are necessary to stand by this statement, including recognizing Israel’s freedom of actions.""  ""We’ve restored unity of purpose between the United States and Europe and much of the world against Iranian provocations, nuclear activities,"" he said while also noting that the U.S. is exerting pressure on ""Iran through sanctions.""

(West Asia News Agency/Handout via REUTERS )""Iran has not crossed the threshold into building a nuclear weapon because the supreme leader has not decided to weaponize the program,"" Joel Rubin, a former deputy assistant secretary of state who served in the Obama administration, told Digital.  ""This position has been confirmed by multiple U.S. intelligence community assessments over the past several years."" He continued that ""While only the supreme leader can truly say why he has taken this position, it's known that continued diplomatic isolation by the international community that followed the expansion of its nuclear program is causing pain for the Iranian regime.""  AIR FORCE SQUADRON IN MIDDLE EAST ARMS UP WITH 'BUNKER BUSTING' BOMBS TO COUNTER IRANRubin said it was clear that Tehran was ""Still open to pursuing a diplomatic path as it knows that if it crosses into weapons-grade nuclear arsenals, which it is capable of doing, the nation would be further isolated internationally — even by its allies. It would trigger a regional nuclear arms race, and Tehran would never get out from under the sanctions pressure it currently is experiencing,"" he said.  ""What is clear from recent years is that a firm, verifiable diplomatic agreement with Iran over its nuclear program is the best way to ensure that it never obtains a nuclear weapon. Military threats alone will not get us there,"" Rubin concluded.      U.S. Central Command and the IDF are taking part in a joint military exercise known as ""Exercise Juniper Oak"" taking place in Israel and the Eastern Mediterranean Sea.  (IDF Spokesman's Unit)Low-intensity military deterrence against Iran’s regime has been playing out for a number of years, according to Israeli media outlets. ""We have the ability to hit Iran,"" Israel’s defense chief warned this week.The United States military and Israel Defense Forces launched a joint drill, Juniper Falcon, in February. The IDF's website stated ""The exercise tested collective U.S.-Israel readiness and strengthened the interoperability between the two militaries,"" the IDF stated on its website after the drill.  Yet there are growing concerns the Biden administration is not inflicting enough pressure on Iran’s regime to change its conduct. Over 100 former world leaders urged Biden this week to get tough on Iran.  Earlier this week Israel's Defense Minister Yoav Gallant reportedly said during a visit to Hatzor Air Force Base that Israel is preparing for a ""complex, difficult and more significant objective.""

(Mario Tama/Getty Images)EX-MOSSAD CHIEF SIGNALS ISRAEL BEHIND IRAN NUCLEAR ATTACKS    Military deterrence has been the single greatest factor in slowing Iran’s illicit nuclear program. U.S. saber-rattling has influenced a change in the Islamic Republic’s behavior. In 2007, a declassified U.S. National Intelligence Estimate determined with ""high confidence"" that Iran’s regime stopped it nuclear weapons program in 2003. Iran experts believe the Islamic Republic temporarily pulled the plug on its illegal atomic program due to the U.S. invasion of Iraq and fears the U.S. would launch a military incursion into Iran.  The sheer survival of Iran’s regime forced the then supreme leader Khomeini to agree to a cease-fire with Iraq in 1988 after eight years of war. At the time he compared the truce to drinking from ""a chalice of poison.""   CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPAmerican pressure prompted Khomeini to release U.S. hostages in 1981 during the diplomatic crisis. All of these examples suggest Iran’s regime is enormously vulnerable to military pressure and other forms of leverage that threaten its legitimacy and existence. ""Iran’s regime is quite calculating,"" Daftari said. ""As rogue as they have been in capturing oil tankers in the seas, continuing the support of regional terror and, of course, the brutal wholesale executions of innocent protesters, they continue to weigh out the consequences of a heated military confrontation with Israel or the United States.""

Police only intervened to arrest the man who got physical with the demonstrators, prompting criticism from nearby pedestrians.   BARE-CHESTED CLIMATE ACTIVISTS IN ROME SMEAR THEMSELVES WITH MUD TO PROTEST FOSSIL FUEL USE, EVOKE FLOODING    Activists from Just Stop Oil take part in a slow march along a road in London's financial district on Monday.

Sarah Huckabee Sanders, R., says she's on a mission to protect children from ""the radical left woke mob"" that parents in Democrat-run states are forced to worry about, signing bills on everything from education reform and transgender bathroom issues to making sure parents know what social media platforms their kids are using.     ""I think the best thing that conservatives can do, that are living in blue states, is move to Arkansas. It's really simple. That's the best pathway forward, then you don't have to worry about those things because we're going to make sure that the kids are protected and that they're in good learning environments,"" Sanders joked during an interview with Digital before taking a more serious turn. ""I think parents have to pay attention. If anything, we learned during the course of the last couple of years during the COVID pandemic is that parents are now awakened to a lot of things that are taking place in the classroom,"" the Arkansas governor said. ""Whether that's curriculum, ideology, a number of other things, parents should be paying attention to how and where their kids are educated and engaging and making sure that their kids are being educated in the way that they believe that reflects their values, and if not, have opportunities to put them in an environment that's more reflective of that, what they want to see.""  ARKANSAS ENACTS BILL BANNING TRANSGENDER STUDENTS FROM USING BATHROOM OF THEIR CHOICE IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS    Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, R., is on a mission to protect children from ""the radical left woke mob"" that parents in Democrat-run states are forced worry about. (The Associated Press)In March, Sanders signed into law a prohibition on transgender people at Arkansas public schools from using the restroom corresponding with their gender identity. The piece of legislation applies to multi-person restrooms and locker rooms at public schools and charter schools from kindergarten through 12th grade. The law will be in place before the 2023-24 school year begins.  ""The idea that we are going to allow the radical left woke mob to redefine what a woman is, in particular, or what a man is, is absolutely insane and unbelievable,"" Sanders said. ""Our goal is always going to be to put forward legislation that we feel like protects kids and keeps them in a safe environment. That's our job, as our responsibility is to do everything we can to protect children,"" she continued. ""That's what this legislation, and a lot of the pieces of legislation that we focused on during this session, were about -- protecting kids and giving them a safe environment. That's exactly what this does.""   Sanders is also an outspoken critic of allowing biological men who identify as women being allowed to compete in sports with biological women, an issue that has sparked debate around the nation. She wants young women in Arkansas, and all over the nation, to be able to compete in athletics with the opportunity to actually win. ""The idea that we are rewriting the rules of science to fit what this small group wants to believe is simply not something that we're going to sit around and stand for,"" Sanders said.   ""We're seeing a lot more people, certainly a lot more women athletes, a lot more parents starting to step up. And we want to be one of the voices in that conversation, pushing back against that ideology,"" she said. ""I don't think that's something we can sit back and not engage in that conversation and push back on the crazy new rules that the left is trying to create and write for all women everywhere.""    ARKANSAS GOV. HUCKABEE SANDERS SIGNS EDUCATION REFORM PACKAGE INTO LAW: 'THE FAILED STATUS QUO ENDED TODAY'  Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders signs into law an education overhaul bill on Wednesday, March 8, 2023 in Little Rock, Arkansas.  (  (AP Photo/Andrew DeMillo))But Sanders’ ongoing crusade to protect children isn’t limited to social issues, and she signed a sweeping educational reform bill in March. Arkansas became the fifth state to pass universal school choice with Senate Bill 294, also known as ""Arkansas LEARNS."" Sanders said it was the most comprehensive education reform package in Arkansas history to ""transform the state"" and helps put kids on a ""pathway to prosperity and success.""    ""We don't want kids to be forever dependent on a very broken system. We are going in Arkansas from being 48th in the country in teacher pay to top five. We are focusing on things that empower parents to make the best decisions about how their kids can be educated and where their kids can be educated. I'm a mom of three kids, and what works for each of my kids is very different. And we cannot have a one size fits all approach,"" Sanders said. ""We have to give parents the option to decide whether that's a private school, a public school, a charter school, or homeschool.""The Arkansas legislation broadened school choice and included a plan for the state to adopt universal choice by the 2025-2026 school year. The bill will gradually provide vouchers through ""Education Freedom Accounts,"" which equal 90% of funding allocated per student to each public school district in the previous year. ""Our job should not be to teach kids what to think, but instead teach kids how to think,"" she said.   ""We've got to stop with pushing a leftist agenda and help kids understand how to learn, how to have critical thinking so that they know how to think, not necessarily what to think by some kind of leftist idea of what they think they should know,"" Sanders continued. ""We want to make sure kids are prepared to go into the workforce when they finish with school.""    BIDEN IS HURTING MY SPECIAL NEEDS SON, BUT SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS IS HELPING  Arkansas Gov.

(Al Drago/Bloomberg via Getty Images)Another big component is literacy, and making sure all students meet basic benchmarks.   ""We know that if a child is not reading by the time they're in third grade, we're setting them up for a lifetime of trouble and failure. We have to do a better job of helping prepare our kids by teaching them to read, building that strong foundation so that they're going to have long-term success,"" Sanders said. In April, Sanders signed a bill into law that will require social media platforms to get parental permission for new user registration of minors, a bill she says will ""protect kids and empower parents."" The law will require any new social media user to verify their age through an independent third-party verification system, and anybody under the age of 18 would need a parent's permission to use the app.   The governor has said she hopes the law will empower parents to help protect their children from harmful aspects of social media platforms.  ""We know that social media, while it can be a great tool, and it's something a lot of us use on a daily basis and can be a great resource, can also be really dangerous for young kids. Depression, loneliness, suicide rates among teenagers have doubled since social media became so widespread,"" Sanders previously told Digital. ’ Brianna Herlihy, Joshua Nelson and Elizabeth Pritchett contributed to this report.   CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP      Brian Flood is a media reporter for Digital.

Mary Tyler Moore, who lit up the screen with her million-watt smile during the ‘60s and ‘70s, was left nearly in the dark during the final months of her life.    The actress, who starred in ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"" before charming audiences with her spunk in ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show,"" was left nearly blind from a decades-long battle with diabetes. She passed away in 2017 at age 80 from a cardiopulmonary arrest after she contracted pneumonia.The star was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes at age 33 following a miscarriage.

(Paul Morigi/WireImage)""Over time, she suffered many of the complications of diabetes,"" Moore’s husband, Dr. Robert Levine, told Digital. ""But the one thing that had the greatest impact on her was the fact that she was nearly blinded by it in her later years. Mary had such narrowed visual fields and such limited central vision that she was unable to read. She was unable to walk across a room safely without bumping into things or tripping over things. And for a woman who was in her heart a dancer and so physically capable and so independent, just imagine what that would mean to you, to have your joy robbed from you.""  ""Visual loss from diabetes was a big issue for Mary,"" he added.

Levine serves as an executive producer.Moore was married twice before she met the cardiologist, first to film producer Richard Meeker from 1955 to 1961, and then to TV executive Grant Tinker from 1962 to 1981. In 1982 – two years after the death of Moore’s only child, she watched over her mother Marjorie, who fell ill with severe bronchitis after coming back from a trip to Europe. Moore called her regular doctor, who was unavailable. She then connected with Levine, who happened to be on call that day. He was working at New York’s Mount Sinai Hospital.    Mary Tyler Moore had dreams of becoming a dancer before she found success on television. (Getty Images)""We all walk into relationships with baggage,"" Levine reflected. ""I was a young doctor. I had no expectation in my life of actually ever having a relationship with anything or anyone other than medicine. That was my calling. That’s what I was committed to. When we met, I was not prepared to have a relationship with anyone. But as you see in her work, there was something so compelling about Mary, so genuine, so approachable. And all my usual barriers to interaction with people, my fears, were kind of reduced. They were eliminated.""

(HBO)Moore was instantly smitten by the bespectacled doctor, who was 15 years her junior. As for Levine, he had no idea his patient’s daughter was a star. He insisted college and medical school kept him away from watching TV shows like ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show.""After a second visit, Levine advised Moore, ""If you need anything, just give me a call."" Moore replied, ""Does acute loneliness count? Is that a good enough reason to call?""    ""I came back with something completely unexpected,"" Levine chuckled. ""I said, ‘I can’t think of a better reason to be awakened at 3 a.m.’ But she allowed me to be natural, to be relaxed, to be uninhibited, to engage at the moment, which is something that I never really had done with a woman before. And so, our life together, our love, was just that. It was immediate. It was natural. It was an ease with which we both felt with one another that persisted through the years.""  Mary Tyler Moore and Dr. Robert Levine married in 1983. The union lasted until Moore's death. (Getty Images)A few days after the memorable quip, they made a dinner date. They went on to spend every weekend together. Moore would gush to friends that she was head over heels in love.In 1983, the couple said, ""I do."" It was Levine’s first and only marriage. Moore’s former co-star and close friend Valerie Harper was a bridesmaid.  Director James Adolphus told Digital it was crucial to examine Moore’s triumphs and turmoils, the events that shaped her life and career.    ‘MARY TYLER MOORE’ STAR CLORIS LEACHMAN’S DAUGHTER RECALLS GROWING UP WITH THE LATE ACTRESS: ‘SHE WAS BRAVE’  ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" spawned the spinoffs ""Rhoda"" (1974-78), starring Valerie Harper, ""Phyllis"" (1975-77) starring Cloris Leachman, and ""Lou Grant"" (1977-82), starring Ed Asner, a rare drama to come from a comedy. (CBS Photo Archie/Getty Images)""I came into this project having never seen a frame of anything she had ever done in her life,"" he explained. ""She was only a reference and a Weezer song to me before I joined this project. I started with her autobiography… I understood she was a woman who led with vulnerability… And I learned what she meant to so many people. How she turned the world on with her smile. But she was a person who had to hide a more honest version of herself from the world to protect herself. Having to constantly uplift and inspire takes a tremendous amount of sacrifice. And a lot of that sacrifice was hiding from everyone… She led with a vulnerability, and I connected with her in a profound way.""  ""That was our guiding light – protecting Mary and those vulnerabilities,"" he shared.On ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show,"" Moore played Mary Richards, a confident Minneapolis TV news producer who was comfortable being single in her 30s. While she dated, she wasn’t desperate to get married. Before then, Moore was frazzled wife Laurie Petrie on ""The Dick Van Dyke Show,"" who traded in housedresses for Capri pants to signify the modern American woman. She argued, ""I don’t wear flowered frocks and high heels to vacuum. And none of my friends do either.""    In ""The Dick Van Dyke Show,"" Mary Tyler Moore traded in the housedress of countless sitcom wives for Capri pants that were as fashionable as they were suited to a modern American woman. (HBO)She was also a daring actress whose talents extended beyond comedy, Robert Redford once said. The actor directed her to an Oscar nomination in the 1980 drama ""Ordinary People.""  But when cameras stopped rolling, Moore was faced with personal struggles. As a child, her parents were both alcoholics, The New York Times reported. Levine noted that it Moore's aunt and grandmother who rescued her from ""the chaos of home life with her alcoholic parents.""Tragedy lingered. Moore's son Richard, who faced trouble with school and drugs, accidentally shot himself at age 24. Her younger sister, Elizabeth, passed away at age 21 from a combination of painkillers and alcohol. Her brother John was 47 when he died of kidney cancer.  In her 1995 autobiography ""After All,"" Moore admitted she helped her terminally ill brother try to commit suicide by feeding him ice cream laced with a deadly overdose of drugs. The attempt failed. He passed away three months later.    DONNA SUMMER, '70S 'QUEEN OF DISCO,' STRUGGLED WITH ABUSE, SUICIDAL THOUGHTS AS SHE SKYROCKETED TO FAME: DOC  Richard G.

Levine was by her side and even performed a two-week study of the fluctuations in his wife’s blood chemistry to see how drinking was impacting her diabetes. The social cocktails, he found, were affecting her health. With his encouragement, Moore welcomed sobriety with open arms.  Mary Tyler Moore spent five weeks at the Betty Ford Clinic in 1984. Dr. Robert Levine supported her along the way. (Theo Wargo/WireImage)""Behind that smile, which she offered so generously and so freely, was a woman with great resilience,"" said Adolphus. ""She was always about telling her truth.""  Life with Levine was blissful for Moore. The couple, eager to lay down roots, purchased a home in upstate New York. They partnered with the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, with both serving on the international board of directors. The pair later moved to Connecticut, where Moore embraced the role of being just another private resident.  She also tirelessly raised awareness of a disease that had long plagued her.

(Robin Platzer/Getty Images)""Mary was just an enormous role model for an entire community of people with diabetes,"" said Levine. ""Her leadership raised awareness about the disease, its challenges and the hope for research. She helped raise billions of dollars for the support of diabetes research. She was an advocate in front of Congress and in front of administrations. She knew she was someone the world loved, appreciated and trusted. And as someone who was personally living with diabetes, she wanted to help. She was determined to make a difference… Her last chapter was really about advocacy and social purpose.""    ""Mary’s life is so rich in the end,"" chimed Adolphus. ""None of us for a moment ever wanted to engage in the telling of Mary’s life and legacy without the point of view being from a lens of a woman who lived with diabetes most of her life.""Today, Levine is determined to keep his late wife’s legacy alive. He’s actively involved with the Mary Tyler Moore Vision Initiative, a research program with a mission to ""preserve and restore vision in people with diabetes"" so that they ""can live joyful and independent lives free from the fear and suffering of vision loss.""

And at the top of the stone, it says, ‘After all,’ because we all wind up in the same place. But the thing that I want people to remember about Mary [are] the three lines I had etched on her memorial: ‘Her spirit a beacon, Her smile eternal, She made us better.’  She, indeed, made people better.

Britney Spears has been very public about being on bad terms with her family since her conservatorship ended in 2021, but now things are changing.    As she revealed in a surprising Instagram post, Britney and her mother, Lynne Spears, have been able to come together and get past their differences.The pop star wrote, ""My sweet mama showed up at my door step yesterday after 3 years … it’s been such a long time … with family there’s always things that need to be worked out … but time heals all wounds!!!""

Let’s go shopping afterwards !!!""The news comes as a bit of a shock, considering how strongly Spears has spoken out about her mother in the past.  While court proceedings were underway before the conservatorship was officially terminated, Spears wrote in a since-deleted Instagram post, ""My dad may have started the conservatorship 13 years ago, but what people don't know is that my mom is the one who gave him the idea!""

But tonight, I will smile — knowing I have a new life ahead of me.""Despite the harsh words, it seems that Lynne never completely gave up hope on rebuilding her relationship with her oldest daughter.

After no coffee for 15 years … Mom we can go have coffee together now !!! I’m treated as an equal … let’s have coffee and talk about it !!!""     Despite the mention of her father, Jamie Spears, the invitation seemed dedicated solely to her mother.
