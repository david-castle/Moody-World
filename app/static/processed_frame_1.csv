But host Japan is increasingly stepping beyond the boundaries set by its history and playing a more assertive role on the world stage. It’s not the only one, as some experts say North Korea’s escalating nuclear threats and worries over China’s sweeping territorial claims that have been sharpened by Russia’s war in Ukraine are pushing Washington’s friends in the region to embrace a more aggressive approach to security — and embrace each other.Historically bitter enemies, Japan and South Korea are each host to tens of thousands of American troops and both are now seeking to build up their militaries and their cooperation. The Chinese government has condemned what it views as smaller countries in its backyard toadying up to their benefactor in Washington. By contrast, this development is music to the ears of the White House, which has long called for countries to join its geopolitical struggle against what it sees as Beijing’s nefarious rise.“The United States has pressured its Asian allies to turn the page on history and cooperate on containing China while dealing with the threat from Pyongyang,” Jeff Kingston, a professor of history and Asian studies at Temple University, Japan Campus, told NBC News.South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, left, and his wife, Kim Keon Hee, have dinner with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and his wife, Yuko Kishida, at the presidential residence in Seoul earlier in May.AFP - Getty ImagesThis all came ahead of the annual summit of G7 leaders, which runs Friday to Sunday. This is an informal club of rich democracies — the U.S., Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy and Japan — which meet each year to discuss global politics. This time it’s being hosted in Hiroshima, “a city which has recovered from the catastrophic damage by an atomic bomb and which continues to seek lasting world peace,” according to the summit’s website. This makes it “the most fitting location to express” the G7’s “commitment to peace.”Top of the agenda is Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, whose President Volodymyr Zelenskyy made an in-person appearance at the summit to rally support.On Friday, the group’s leaders made the direct connection between the city’s history and Russia’s nuclear threats, which have helped drive Japan’s push to make arms control  a major part of the gathering.“We reiterate our position that threats by Russia of nuclear weapon use, let alone any use of nuclear weapons by Russia, in the context of its aggression against Ukraine are inadmissible,” they said in a joint statement.But close behind that grinding conflict is how to approach China, with allies still somewhat divided on how to balance cooperation economically with confrontation on China’s alleged human rights abuses, authoritarianism and territorial expansionism.The Kremlin’s war has sharpened minds in Asia about what would happen if China invaded Taiwan, a self-governed island that Beijing sees as rightfully its territory. “Ukraine today may be East Asia tomorrow,” Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida told another summit in Singapore last June.Some experts believe that, although North Korea's nuclear arsenal is seen as the most pressing threat in Seoul, growing concern about China has emerged as another factor behind a rapprochement between Japan and South Korea that comes as both countries embrace a more hawkish approach to defense.From left: European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, President Biden, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz during the G7 Summit on Friday in Hiroshima, Japan.

The event follows two historic summits between Kishida and South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, with both leaders visiting each other’s capitals for talks over sake and beer.This was a big deal. These were their first formal meetings for more than a decade, beginning the process of resolving bitterness from Japan’s colonial occupation of South Korea from 1910-45. President Joe Biden called it a “groundbreaking new chapter” at the White House in March. Without mentioning China by name, he couched the strengthening partnership as one of “free and open” democracies against authoritarianism — a central theme of his administration.At at a trilateral meeting the G7 summit, Biden invited Yoon and Kishida for another meeting Washington, a senior U.S. official said. In a statement issued after the talks, the White House said the leaders had “discussed how to take their trilateral cooperation to new heights,” including with new coordination in the face of North Korea‘s “illicit nuclear and missile threats.”Japan announced late last year that its military spending will double to 2% of its gross domestic product — a historic departure from its supposedly “pacifist” constitution. It ruffled feathers in Beijing with its decision to deploy Patriot missile batteries on islands close to Taiwan. And it is even considering opening a NATO liaison office, Koji Tomita, Japan’s ambassador to the U.S., said last week, a small but symbolically significant gesture of Western solidarity.In South Korea, the feeling that North Korea's arsenal is becoming ever more of a threat means that more than 70% now favor developing nuclear weapons of their own, a poll last year by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs found.That prompted Washington to announce a new defense pact with the government in Seoul, which included the U.S. sending nuclear-capable submarines to the country — so long as it reaffirmed its promise not to try to get its hands on nuclear weapons of its own.South Korea is heavily reliant on China for trade, so it has historically been careful with how it treats its giant neighbor. But relations between the two have dipped as of late, particularly after South Korea’s president, Yoon, suggested China was attempting “to change the status quo by force” in Taiwan. This sparked a tit-for-tat summoning of ambassadors, with China’s Foreign Ministry calling the comments “erroneous” and “totally unacceptable.”Anti-war protesters gather Wednesday in Hiroshima ahead of the G7.Louise Delmotte / APSimon Chelton, a former British defense attache in Tokyo, said it would be wrong to chalk up the developments solely to concerns over China, North Korean missile tests or prompting by the U.S. — but rather a more complex mix of all three that has been brewing for years if not decades.“The reason that Japan is now increasing spending is not a knee-jerk reaction to what Biden is saying, it’s not a sudden whim,” said Chelton, who is now an associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, a think tank in London. “It is a gradual buildup that goes back many years. Everything in Japan is always gradual.”China sees these moves merely as an excuse for Japan and South Korea to toe America’s line on containing Beijing. Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told a briefing last week that the trio were using North Korea “as a pretext to strengthen military cooperation.” He blamed the U.S. allies for increasing the risk of “bloc confrontation in the region” and undermining “the already fragile mutual trust” between them and Beijing. The state-run news agency Xinhua wrote the same day that “the US has been trying to put together an anti-China coterie for a long time,” describing the alliance as “a plot.”Many experts agree that the strengthening trio is in part motivated by China — and with good reason.“China’s military modernization over the past two decades, involving annual double-digit increases in military spending, combined with greater assertiveness about China’s disputed territorial claims, generates unease about Beijing’s hegemonic ambitions,” Kingston, at Temple University, said.That unease has produced an unlikely bonhomie that not only subverts the bitter rivalry of yesterday but also could shape today’s geopolitical status quo — starting this weekend.Alexander SmithAlexander Smith is a senior reporter for NBC News Digital based in London.Brigitte Pu contributed ","{'neg': 0.092, 'neu': 0.847, 'pos': 0.061, 'compound': -0.9962}","10,423,43",China,"('35.000074', '104.999927')",35.000074,104.999927,"[('China', 15), ('Japan', 15), ('\xa0', 15), ('Korea', 13), ('South', 11)]"

Members have been considering ways to to defend against what they describe as coercive tactics that China deploys for political leverage. Far more than at past G7 summits, the leaders gathered in Hiroshima have devoted attention to an issue they contend is a troubling outgrowth of Beijing’s growing economic might.Heading into meetings Saturday, Biden and his counterparts planned to “outline a common set of tools to address concerns that each of our countries face, including from economic coercion,” Jake Sullivan, the White House national security adviser, told reporters.A 41-page summit communiqué released Saturday made overtures to China but also included a vow that “we will foster resilience to economic coercion.” Succinct as it is, the statement showed at least some threshold level of unity when it comes to countering China's economic clout.The communiqué also announced the creation of a new initiative to “increase our collective assessment, preparedness, deterrence and response to economic coercion.”“There was never a communiqué before that ever mentioned coercion,” Rahm Emanuel, U.S. ambassador to Japan, told NBC News in an interview Friday. “You can’t find it.  “Given the frequency with which China turns to this instrument and tool, you can’t just have an ad hoc strategy,” Emanuel added. “You have to have a coordinated strategy that is well thought out, with all the tools available, and you know how to respond.”In a strongly worded response on Saturday, a spokesperson for China’s Foreign Ministry accused the G7 of “smearing and attacking China, and grossly interfering in China’s internal affairs.“The G7 talks about ‘moving toward a peaceful, stable and prosperous world,’ but what it does is hinder international peace, damage regional stability and suppress the development of other countries,” the spokesperson said. “Such actions have no international credibility at all.”Reaching any sort of international consensus around China is tricky. The G7 countries are scattered across the globe and have distinct trade and diplomatic relations with Beijing.French President Emmanuel Macron, whose country is part of the G7, visited China last month and caused an uproar in the West when he suggested in an interview that France should strive for “strategic autonomy” and resist falling under the sway of either the U.S. or China.“In the run-up to the G7 summit, French officials have complained privately about pressure from the U.S. to get behind a more confrontational approach to Beijing,” Noah Barkin, a senior adviser at the Rhodium Group research firm, wrote in a newsletter.Identifying instances of China’s coercive use of economic power isn’t always easy. “These things are very specific and almost idiosyncratic — case by case — and often difficult to prove,” Thomas Cynkin of the Atlantic Council said in a news briefing, citing an example of banana exports from the Philippines being left to rot on a dock in China and asking whether it was because Beijing was retaliating for some perceived slight or whether it was a simple mistake.Still, experts have been chronicling cases of what they describe as an abuse of China’s outsize influence as the world’s second largest economy. A report in March by the Center for Strategic and International Studies pointed to a Taiwanese government office that opened in Lithuania two years ago. China considers Taiwan part of its territory under its “one-China” principle, and opening an office under Taiwan's name ran afoul of a Chinese norm, the report says.The backlash was fierce. After the opening was announced, China rejected permits for Lithuanian food imports, and firms in the eastern European country had difficulty getting Chinese contracts approved, the report said.Biden meets with Japanese prime minister at G7 summitMay 18, 202304:35Last month, China opened a cybersecurity review of Micron Technology, a U.S. memory chip maker. The move was seen as retaliation for the Biden administration’s imposition of export controls aimed at depriving Beijing of computer chips that underpin its military and economic expansion.“They’ve gone from targeting countries to coercing companies,” said Emanuel, a former Chicago mayor and White House chief of staff in the Obama administration.The G7 communiqué does not specify how member countries should parry China. Blunting any punitive action taken by China calls for coordinated action and resolve on the part of the U.S. and its allies, analysts have said. If China were to boycott a certain company, other nations might conceivably respond by stepping in and offering lines of credit so that the business doesn’t collapse.Earlier this year, the European Union reached an agreement that allows retaliatory action against nations that use economic muscle to get other countries to bend to their will. As a deterrent, the E.U. would hit violators with import tariffs, for example.“If you have coordinated, unified, collaborative action, you can beat back economic coercion,” Emanuel said.Peter NicholasPeter Nicholas is a senior national political reporter for NBC News ","{'neg': 0.073, 'neu': 0.86, 'pos': 0.067, 'compound': -0.7407}","106,227,0",China,"('35.000074', '104.999927')",35.000074,104.999927,"[('China', 25), ('economic', 13), ('G7', 11), ('coercion', 7), ('News', 6)]"

Stocks of food, cash, and essentials are rapidly dwindling.Air strikes were reported by eyewitnesses in southern Omdurman and northern Bahri, the two cities that lie across the Nile from Khartoum, forming Sudan’s “triple capital.” Some of the strikes took place near the state broadcaster in Omdurman, the eyewitnesses said.Eyewitnesses in Khartoum said that the situation was relatively calm, although sporadic gunshots could be heard.The conflict, which began on April 15, has displaced almost 1.1 million people internally and into neighboring countries. Some 705 people have been killed and at least 5,287 injured, according to the World Health Organization.Talks sponsored by the United States and Saudi Arabia in Jeddah have not been fruitful, and the two sides have accused each other of violating multiple ceasefire agreements.“We faced heavy artillery fire early this morning, the whole house was shaking,” Sanaa Hassan, a 33-year-old living in the al-Salha neighborhood of Omdurman, told Reuters by phone.“It was terrifying, everyone was lying under their beds.

Almost 30 people have died in the two previous days of fighting, according to activists.The war broke out in Khartoum after disputes over plans for the RSF to be integrated into the army and over the future chain of command under an internationally backed deal to shift Sudan towards democracy following decades of conflict-ridden autocracy.The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) announced late on Friday more than $100 million to Sudan and countries receiving fleeing Sudanese, including much-needed food and medical aid.“It’s hard to convey the extent of the suffering occurring right now in Sudan,” said agency head Samantha Power.Reuter ","{'neg': 0.161, 'neu': 0.808, 'pos': 0.032, 'compound': -0.9974}","10,423,43",Khartoum,"('15.5635972', '32.5349123')",15.5635972,32.5349123,"[('Sudan', 8), ('Khartoum', 7), ('strikes', 6), ('fighting', 5), ('News', 4)]"

Members of Pakistan's transgender community takes part in a protest in the Pakistani city of Karachi on Saturday.Fareed Khan / APLink copiedMay 21, 2023, 9:25 AM UTC / Source: Associated PressBy Associated PressTransgender activists in Pakistan said they plan to appeal to the highest court in the land an Islamic court’s ruling that guts a law aimed at protecting their rights.The Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act was passed by Parliament in 2018 to secure the fundamental rights of transgender Pakistanis. It ensures their access to legal gender recognition, among other rights.Many Pakistanis have entrenched beliefs on gender and sexuality and transgender people are often considered outcasts. Some are forced into begging, dancing and even prostitution to earn money. They also live in fear of attacks.The Federal Shariat Court on Friday struck down several provisions of the landmark law, terming them “un-Islamic.”It ruled that a person cannot change their gender on the basis of “innermost feeling” or “self-perceived identity” and must conform to the biological sex assigned to them at the time of birth.The Shariah court has the constitutional mandate of examining and determining whether laws passed by Pakistan’s parliament comply with Islamic doctrine.Around a dozen activists protested in the southern port city of Karachi on Saturday against the ruling.Members of Pakistan's transgender community gesture plan to appeal an Islamic court’s ruling that guts a law aimed at protecting their rights.Fareed Khan / APLawyer Sara Malkani, who was speaking at an event organized by the Gender Interactive Alliance, denied the legislation was un-Islamic. She said the existence of two genders did not limit the concept of gender identity and that Islamic texts, including the Quran, did not associate specific behavior to specific genders.“We absolutely intend to appeal the court’s findings to the Supreme Court, and we will prevail,” said Nayyab Ali, executive director of Transgender Rights Consultants Pakistan, at a news conference Friday.Ali said the transgender community was “mourning the decimation” of Pakistan’s first transgender rights protection legislation in response to the Islamic court’s finding.However, clerics and representatives from religious parties say the law has the potential to promote homosexuality in this conservative country with a Muslim majority. They want the Islamic court to annul the law.The Shariah court ruled that the term “transgender” as it is used in the law creates confusion. It covers several biological variations, including intersex, transgender men, transgender women and Khawaja Sira, a Pakistani term commonly used for those who were born male but identify as female.It also rejected a clause in the law in which the country’s national database and registration authority permits the change of a person’s biological gender from the one they were assigned at birth in identification documents including drivers licenses and passports.It said permitting any person to change their gender in accordance with his or her inner feeling or self-perceived identity will create “serious religious, legal and social problems.”For example it will allow a transgender woman — a person who is biologically male — to access social and religious gatherings of females or women-only public places, and vice versa, it said.“This law will pave the way for criminals in society to easily commit crimes like sexual molestation, sexual assault and even rape against females in the disguise of a transgender woman,” the court ruled.However, the court said Islamic law recognizes the existence of intersex people and eunuchs and said they should be entitled to all the fundamental rights provided to Pakistanis in the constitution.The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan expressed dismay over the “regressive ruling” and said the denial of transgender people’s rights to self-perceived gender identity seeks the “erasure of an entire demographic and its fundamental rights.” It said rolling back the transgender bill will lead to further marginalization and abuse of an already vulnerable community in Pakistan.Amnesty International called on the government to stop any attempts to prevent transgender people from obtaining official documents reflecting their gender identity without complying with abusive and invasive requirements.“This verdict is a blow to the rights of the already beleaguered group of transgender and gender-diverse people in Pakistan,” said Rehab Mahamoor, research assistant at Amnesty International, in a statement.She said any steps to deny transgender and gender-diverse people the right to determine their own gender identity would violate international human rights law.Sana, 40, a eunuch in Rawalpindi who asked to be identified by one name, told The Associated Press on Saturday that she favored the court’s ruling because a large number of gay men were being included in her “original and by-birth” eunuch community.She alleged that those who become transgender men through surgical castration are “denying the rights” of her community by affecting their access to employment opportunities under the government’s job quota reserved for their community.Associated Pres ","{'neg': 0.064, 'neu': 0.876, 'pos': 0.061, 'compound': -0.9504}","10,423,43",Pakistan,"('30.3308401', '71.247499')",30.3308401,71.247499,"[('transgender', 17), ('court', 13), ('law', 12), ('gender', 12), ('rights', 12)]"

But host Japan is increasingly stepping beyond the boundaries set by its history and playing a more assertive role on the world stage. It’s not the only one, as some experts say North Korea’s escalating nuclear threats and worries over China’s sweeping territorial claims that have been sharpened by Russia’s war in Ukraine are pushing Washington’s friends in the region to embrace a more aggressive approach to security — and embrace each other.Historically bitter enemies, Japan and South Korea are each host to tens of thousands of American troops and both are now seeking to build up their militaries and their cooperation. The Chinese government has condemned what it views as smaller countries in its backyard toadying up to their benefactor in Washington. By contrast, this development is music to the ears of the White House, which has long called for countries to join its geopolitical struggle against what it sees as Beijing’s nefarious rise.“The United States has pressured its Asian allies to turn the page on history and cooperate on containing China while dealing with the threat from Pyongyang,” Jeff Kingston, a professor of history and Asian studies at Temple University, Japan Campus, told NBC News.South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, left, and his wife, Kim Keon Hee, have dinner with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and his wife, Yuko Kishida, at the presidential residence in Seoul earlier in May.AFP - Getty ImagesThis all came ahead of the annual summit of G7 leaders, which runs Friday to Sunday.

This makes it “the most fitting location to express” the G7’s “commitment to peace.”Top of the agenda is Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, whose President Volodymyr Zelenskyy made an in-person appearance at the summit to rally support.On Friday, the group’s leaders made the direct connection between the city’s history and Russia’s nuclear threats, which have helped drive Japan’s push to make arms control  a major part of the gathering.“We reiterate our position that threats by Russia of nuclear weapon use, let alone any use of nuclear weapons by Russia, in the context of its aggression against Ukraine are inadmissible,” they said in a joint statement.But close behind that grinding conflict is how to approach China, with allies still somewhat divided on how to balance cooperation economically with confrontation on China’s alleged human rights abuses, authoritarianism and territorial expansionism.The Kremlin’s war has sharpened minds in Asia about what would happen if China invaded Taiwan, a self-governed island that Beijing sees as rightfully its territory. “Ukraine today may be East Asia tomorrow,” Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida told another summit in Singapore last June.Some experts believe that, although North Korea's nuclear arsenal is seen as the most pressing threat in Seoul, growing concern about China has emerged as another factor behind a rapprochement between Japan and South Korea that comes as both countries embrace a more hawkish approach to defense.From left: European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, President Biden, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz during the G7 Summit on Friday in Hiroshima, Japan.

The event follows two historic summits between Kishida and South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, with both leaders visiting each other’s capitals for talks over sake and beer.This was a big deal. These were their first formal meetings for more than a decade, beginning the process of resolving bitterness from Japan’s colonial occupation of South Korea from 1910-45. President Joe Biden called it a “groundbreaking new chapter” at the White House in March. Without mentioning China by name, he couched the strengthening partnership as one of “free and open” democracies against authoritarianism — a central theme of his administration.At at a trilateral meeting the G7 summit, Biden invited Yoon and Kishida for another meeting Washington, a senior U.S. official said. In a statement issued after the talks, the White House said the leaders had “discussed how to take their trilateral cooperation to new heights,” including with new coordination in the face of North Korea‘s “illicit nuclear and missile threats.”Japan announced late last year that its military spending will double to 2% of its gross domestic product — a historic departure from its supposedly “pacifist” constitution. It ruffled feathers in Beijing with its decision to deploy Patriot missile batteries on islands close to Taiwan. And it is even considering opening a NATO liaison office, Koji Tomita, Japan’s ambassador to the U.S., said last week, a small but symbolically significant gesture of Western solidarity.In South Korea, the feeling that North Korea's arsenal is becoming ever more of a threat means that more than 70% now favor developing nuclear weapons of their own, a poll last year by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs found.That prompted Washington to announce a new defense pact with the government in Seoul, which included the U.S. sending nuclear-capable submarines to the country — so long as it reaffirmed its promise not to try to get its hands on nuclear weapons of its own.South Korea is heavily reliant on China for trade, so it has historically been careful with how it treats its giant neighbor. But relations between the two have dipped as of late, particularly after South Korea’s president, Yoon, suggested China was attempting “to change the status quo by force” in Taiwan. This sparked a tit-for-tat summoning of ambassadors, with China’s Foreign Ministry calling the comments “erroneous” and “totally unacceptable.”Anti-war protesters gather Wednesday in Hiroshima ahead of the G7.Louise Delmotte / APSimon Chelton, a former British defense attache in Tokyo, said it would be wrong to chalk up the developments solely to concerns over China, North Korean missile tests or prompting by the U.S. — but rather a more complex mix of all three that has been brewing for years if not decades.“The reason that Japan is now increasing spending is not a knee-jerk reaction to what Biden is saying, it’s not a sudden whim,” said Chelton, who is now an associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, a think tank in London. “It is a gradual buildup that goes back many years. Everything in Japan is always gradual.”China sees these moves merely as an excuse for Japan and South Korea to toe America’s line on containing Beijing. Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told a briefing last week that the trio were using North Korea “as a pretext to strengthen military cooperation.” He blamed the U.S. allies for increasing the risk of “bloc confrontation in the region” and undermining “the already fragile mutual trust” between them and Beijing. The state-run news agency Xinhua wrote the same day that “the US has been trying to put together an anti-China coterie for a long time,” describing the alliance as “a plot.”Many experts agree that the strengthening trio is in part motivated by China — and with good reason.“China’s military modernization over the past two decades, involving annual double-digit increases in military spending, combined with greater assertiveness about China’s disputed territorial claims, generates unease about Beijing’s hegemonic ambitions,” Kingston, at Temple University, said.That unease has produced an unlikely bonhomie that not only subverts the bitter rivalry of yesterday but also could shape today’s geopolitical status quo — starting this weekend.Alexander SmithAlexander Smith is a senior reporter for NBC News Digital based in London.Brigitte Pu contributed ","{'neg': 0.092, 'neu': 0.847, 'pos': 0.061, 'compound': -0.9962}","10,423,43",China,"('35.000074', '104.999927')",35.000074,104.999927,"[('China', 15), ('Japan', 15), ('\xa0', 15), ('Korea', 13), ('South', 11)]"

Members have been considering ways to to defend against what they describe as coercive tactics that China deploys for political leverage. Far more than at past G7 summits, the leaders gathered in Hiroshima have devoted attention to an issue they contend is a troubling outgrowth of Beijing’s growing economic might.Heading into meetings Saturday, Biden and his counterparts planned to “outline a common set of tools to address concerns that each of our countries face, including from economic coercion,” Jake Sullivan, the White House national security adviser, told reporters.A 41-page summit communiqué released Saturday made overtures to China but also included a vow that “we will foster resilience to economic coercion.” Succinct as it is, the statement showed at least some threshold level of unity when it comes to countering China's economic clout.The communiqué also announced the creation of a new initiative to “increase our collective assessment, preparedness, deterrence and response to economic coercion.”“There was never a communiqué before that ever mentioned coercion,” Rahm Emanuel, U.S. ambassador to Japan, told NBC News in an interview Friday. “You can’t find it.  “Given the frequency with which China turns to this instrument and tool, you can’t just have an ad hoc strategy,” Emanuel added. “You have to have a coordinated strategy that is well thought out, with all the tools available, and you know how to respond.”In a strongly worded response on Saturday, a spokesperson for China’s Foreign Ministry accused the G7 of “smearing and attacking China, and grossly interfering in China’s internal affairs.“The G7 talks about ‘moving toward a peaceful, stable and prosperous world,’ but what it does is hinder international peace, damage regional stability and suppress the development of other countries,” the spokesperson said. “Such actions have no international credibility at all.”Reaching any sort of international consensus around China is tricky. The G7 countries are scattered across the globe and have distinct trade and diplomatic relations with Beijing.French President Emmanuel Macron, whose country is part of the G7, visited China last month and caused an uproar in the West when he suggested in an interview that France should strive for “strategic autonomy” and resist falling under the sway of either the U.S. or China.“In the run-up to the G7 summit, French officials have complained privately about pressure from the U.S. to get behind a more confrontational approach to Beijing,” Noah Barkin, a senior adviser at the Rhodium Group research firm, wrote in a newsletter.Identifying instances of China’s coercive use of economic power isn’t always easy. “These things are very specific and almost idiosyncratic — case by case — and often difficult to prove,” Thomas Cynkin of the Atlantic Council said in a news briefing, citing an example of banana exports from the Philippines being left to rot on a dock in China and asking whether it was because Beijing was retaliating for some perceived slight or whether it was a simple mistake.Still, experts have been chronicling cases of what they describe as an abuse of China’s outsize influence as the world’s second largest economy. A report in March by the Center for Strategic and International Studies pointed to a Taiwanese government office that opened in Lithuania two years ago. China considers Taiwan part of its territory under its “one-China” principle, and opening an office under Taiwan's name ran afoul of a Chinese norm, the report says.The backlash was fierce. After the opening was announced, China rejected permits for Lithuanian food imports, and firms in the eastern European country had difficulty getting Chinese contracts approved, the report said.Biden meets with Japanese prime minister at G7 summitMay 18, 202304:35Last month, China opened a cybersecurity review of Micron Technology, a U.S. memory chip maker. The move was seen as retaliation for the Biden administration’s imposition of export controls aimed at depriving Beijing of computer chips that underpin its military and economic expansion.“They’ve gone from targeting countries to coercing companies,” said Emanuel, a former Chicago mayor and White House chief of staff in the Obama administration.The G7 communiqué does not specify how member countries should parry China. Blunting any punitive action taken by China calls for coordinated action and resolve on the part of the U.S. and its allies, analysts have said. If China were to boycott a certain company, other nations might conceivably respond by stepping in and offering lines of credit so that the business doesn’t collapse.Earlier this year, the European Union reached an agreement that allows retaliatory action against nations that use economic muscle to get other countries to bend to their will. As a deterrent, the E.U. would hit violators with import tariffs, for example.“If you have coordinated, unified, collaborative action, you can beat back economic coercion,” Emanuel said.Peter NicholasPeter Nicholas is a senior national political reporter for NBC News ","{'neg': 0.073, 'neu': 0.86, 'pos': 0.067, 'compound': -0.7407}","106,227,0",China,"('35.000074', '104.999927')",35.000074,104.999927,"[('China', 25), ('economic', 13), ('G7', 11), ('coercion', 7), ('News', 6)]"

Peace will become closer today.”Wearing his trademark green military fatigues, he shook hands with officials  before he was whisked off to the G7 summit, where he met with several heads of state, including British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and French President Emmanuel Macron. He was also expected to meet with President Joe Biden and deliver a speech.

(Kyodo News via AP)APAlso on the agenda is a tour of a Hiroshima museum dedicated to the atomic bomb attack that leveled the city at the end of World War II. The visit to the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum will likely have special resonance for Zelenskyy, whose small country is at war with a nuclear-armed power.In the run-up to the three-day event, participants had expected the Ukrainian leader to appear at least virtually. Until Friday, there had been no confirmation that Zelenskyy would make the potentially dangerous trip from Kyiv, the farthest he has traveled from his country since last year’s invasion.Biden adds meeting with Zelenskyy to schedule during G-7 summitMay 20, 202302:55He landed hours after the U.S. agreed to allow training on American-made F-16 fighter jets, laying the groundwork for their eventual transfer to Ukraine. White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan later told reporters in Japan that Biden had shared plans with G7 allies — Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada — to supply the aircraft.“Over the past few months, we and our allies and partners have really focused on providing Ukraine with the systems, weapons and training that it needs to be able to conduct effective offensive operations this spring and summer,” Sullivan said. “We have delivered what we promised, we have given Ukraine what it needs based on close consultations between our military and theirs, and now, we have turned to discussions about improving the Ukrainian air force as part of our long-term commitment to Ukraine self defense.”Sullivan suggested that the fighter jets were part of that commitment, and that as the training unfolds in the coming months, the United States would work with allies to determine details about delivery of the jets, including how many would be sent.The timing for when Ukraine will receive the fighter jets — and which countries will provide them — remains unclear, but a senior Biden administration official told NBC News Friday the planes would not be used for Ukraine’s upcoming counteroffensive against Russia.Sullivan also told reporters that he believed it was “a safe bet” that  Biden would meet with Zelenskyy at the summit.U.S. and G7 allies agree to send F-16 fighter jets to UkraineMay 19, 202303:01The G7 vowed to intensify the pressure on Russia in a joint statement Saturday.“Russia’s brutal war of aggression represents a threat to the whole world in breach of fundamental norms, rules and principles of the international community. We reaffirm our unwavering support for Ukraine for as long as it takes to bring a comprehensive, just and lasting peace,” it said.Russia is now the most-sanctioned country in the world, and the latest measures aimed at Moscow include tighter restrictions on previously sanctioned people and firms involved in the war effort. “Our support for Ukraine will not waver,” the statement said.

Russia-China border town shows countries’ deepening ties02:17Link copiedMay 20, 2023, 10:00 AM UTCBy Janis Mackey Frayer, Dawn Liu and Jennifer JettHEIHE, China — For about 1,000 miles, China and Russia are separated by the vast Amur River — a symbol of the countries’ tense and complicated history. A Russian flag could be seen fluttering across the frozen river from the Chinese border town of Heihe. From here, the two look a lot more like friends than rivals. The two countries’ close ties were on vivid display in this trading outpost when NBC News visited recently. Trucks loaded with goods regularly crossed the Amur, known in China as the Heilong, along a new bridge linking Heihe to Blagoveschchensk, its sister city in Russia. The Russian influence in Heihe, such as the Russian-style domes or spires that top Chinese-style apartment towers, schools, museums and even some government buildings, draws tourists from all over China.People cross the road outside a mall emblazoned with Russian and Chinese inscriptions in the city of Heihe in northern China last month.Fred Dufour / NBC NewsSanctioned by the United States and allies for its war on Ukraine, Russia has found an economic lifeline in neighboring China, with which it declared a “no limits” partnership  weeks before the Ukraine invasion in February 2022. Bilateral trade grew almost 30% last year, according to Chinese customs figures, and Russia was China’s top oil supplier in the first two months of the year.“It’s very obvious Russia is increasingly dependent on China, even though Russians may not like that,” said Jon Yuan Jiang, a China-Russia relations expert in Sydney.Heihe, a city of some 1.5 million people, is largely bilingual, with shop names, street signs and menus written in Chinese and Russian. Local business owners, even fruit vendors and roadside popcorn makers, greet foreigners in simple Russian, a skill they learned before the pandemic when Russian customers came in large numbers.“When the border trade was not affected by the pandemic, we could see Russians everywhere on the street, just like meeting with old friends,” a man who identified himself only by his surname, Shi, 70, told NBC News while walking his dog in a riverside park with large sculptures of Russian dolls.Between the Ukraine conflict and strict “zero-Covid” policies that China only recently ended, there have been fewer visitors from across the border, said Tang Lu, the owner of a Russian-style bar whose customers are mainly Russians.“But Chinese people also like this place, and they may sing and interact with Russians,” she said.A customer shops underneath a Russian flag in a supermarket in Heihe. Bloomberg via Getty Images fileWhile China and Russia have a long and often acrimonious relationship dating back centuries, the war in Ukraine has pushed them closer together, with China supporting Russia politically and economically and repeating Russian talking points.Chinese President Xi Jinping is trying to strike a delicate balance in his approach to the Ukraine conflict, Jiang said. China has sought to portray itself as neutral, refusing to condemn Russia’s aggression or even call it an invasion, while also calling for peace talks. Xi and Russian President Vladimir Putin, who describe each other as friends, have talked multiple times since the war began and met in Moscow last month. Meanwhile, there is no indication when Xi will speak with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy who he spoke with for the first time late last month.“China doesn’t really want to support Russia in Russia’s aggression against Ukraine, but China does not want Vladimir Putin to fail as well,” fearing he could be replaced with a pro-Western government, Jiang said. Chinese efforts to appear aloof from the conflict took a hit after Beijing’s ambassador to France said the countries in eastern Europe that gained independence following the Soviet Union’s fall in 1991 did not have “effective” sovereign status in international law, prompting a furious response from European officials.The cross-border bridge that links the Chinese city of Heihe with the Russian city of Blagoveshchensk.Fred Dufour / NBC NewsChina appeared to downplay Lu’s remarks, affirming the former Soviet nations’ sovereignty and emphasizing its preferred role as an honest broker in the war.A major reason China has avoided supporting Russia too openly, Jiang said, is it doesn’t want to jeopardize its vision of a multipolar international order that is less dominated by the United States. It especially wants to avoid alienating Europe, which also aspires to a larger global role.“If China is still trying to have a multipolar world, China needs the support of the E.U.,” he said.For that same reason, Jiang said he did not think China would provide Russia with lethal military assistance, which the Biden administration has warned Beijing against. Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang said this month that China would not sell weapons to either side in the war. China has tried to position itself as a potential peacemaker in Ukraine, releasing a 12-point proposal in February that the West has dismissed as too favorable to Russia. The attempts at mediation are part of a broader effort by Xi to present himself as a global statesman and China as an alternative to American power. Last month, Beijing brokered a surprise deal between Saudi Arabia and Iran to restore diplomatic ties for the first time in seven years.China’s Xi visits Putin in Moscow to underline ‘no-limits’ friendshipMarch 21, 202301:07Experts say the shifts in the China-Russia relationship have mostly been to China’s benefit. Western sanctions have made Russia more dependent on China’s currency, the yuan, which Beijing is trying to internationalize. The yuan has replaced the U.S. dollar as the most traded currency on the Moscow Exchange, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, and Bangladesh recently agreed to use yuan to pay for a nuclear plant Russia is building in the South Asian country, Reuters reported.Russia’s growing isolation has also created opportunities for Chinese companies. With tech giants like Apple and Samsung having reduced their operations in the country, more than 70% of Russia’s smartphones now come from Chinese manufacturers like Xiaomi, Reuters reported, citing a statement from the consumer electronics retailer M.Video-Eldorado.But the war in Ukraine still casts a big shadow in border towns like Heihe.“I was in shock and disbelief when the war broke out,” said Shi, the resident in the park. “After all, the war can only bring harm to the people of two countries.

A Western official confirmed to NBC News that Zelenskyy is expected to attend the summit in person.In the run-up to the G-7 summit, participants had expected him to appear at least virtually. But until Friday, there had been no confirmation that he would make the potentially dangerous trip from Kyiv, the furthest he will have traveled from his country since last year's invasion.Biden joined other world leaders to lay wreaths at the Peace Memorial Park in Hiroshima on Friday. Japan has sought to ensure that the symbolic location will mean a focus on arms control.Pool via AFP - Getty ImagesAsked if President Joe Biden would have a face-to-face meeting with Zelenskyy at the summit, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters, “I think it’s a safe bet that President Biden will meet him, but I don’t have a formal announcement of that.”John Kirby, a spokesman for the White House’s National Security Council, earlier said that Zelenskyy ""was always going to participate in the G-7 in some form or fashion.""""It's really important right now, at this inflection point in the war in Ukraine, that G-7 leaders hear directly from him about conditions on the ground and what he needs going forward,"" Kirby said.A charismatic presence in his trademark green fatigues, Zelenskyy will presumably make the case that his nation’s survival hinges on a continued flow of money and sophisticated weaponry from the United States and its allies. Before heading to Japan, he was in Saudi Arabia for the Arab League summit Friday, seeking closer ties with countries beyond the West. He then heads to the G-7 summit that has already agreed on new steps to make the war costlier for Russia. Biden attended a working luncheon Friday focused on the conflict — with papers spread across a round table and flags of each country in the background. Present were the leaders of Japan, Germany, France, Italy, Canada, the United Kingdom, the European Commission and the European Council.Ukraine's Zelenskyy tells Arab League leaders that Russia is 'weak'May 19, 202301:00A subsequent joint statement released by the G-7 leaders laid out a series of new sanctions. Looking to undercut the Kremlin's war-making capacity, the nations agreed to restrict exports to Russia that include industrial machinery, tools and technology.“We will starve Russia of G-7 technology, industrial equipment and services that support its war machine,” the statement reads.Biden later tweeted, ""In lockstep with my fellow G7 Leaders, we’ve placed on Russia the largest set of sanctions and export control actions ever imposed on a major economy.""""Today, we’re taking more action — disrupting Russia’s ability to source inputs for its war, closing evasion loopholes, restricting their access to the international finance system, and reducing reliance on Russian energy,"" Biden added.Ahead of the summit, a Biden official speaking on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on the record, said, “Our commitment to continue tightening the screws on Russia remains as strong as it was last year.”But recent polling shows that Americans are tiring of the war and are eager to see an end date. Russia failed to swiftly conquer its smaller neighbor but has given no sign that it is prepared to withdraw its forces. Nor is Kyiv about to surrender. Ukraine is readying a counteroffensive to retake occupied land and showcase the difference Western support can make on the battlefield.Biden, who last saw Zelenskyy in person during a surprise trip to Kyiv three months ago, vowed at the time that the U.S. would stand with Ukraine for “as long as it takes.”Zelenskyy was greeted by Saudi officials upon his arrival in Jeddah on Friday.Saudi Press Agency / APThat open-ended commitment will test the resolve and patience of Americans in an election season, as the Biden administration spends billions to help keep Ukraine in the fight. The war figures to be an issue in the 2024 presidential race. Republican front-runner Donald Trump has stopped short of saying he wants Ukraine to win and told a recent CNN town hall that, if elected, he’d end the conflict in 24 hours by meeting with Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin.An unexpected domestic problem has intruded on Biden's trip: the debt ceiling fight back in Washington. Biden had originally planned to visit Papua New Guinea and Australia as part of an effort to rally U.S allies and curb China's growing influence in the Pacific. He canceled those legs of the trip so that he could return to the White House on Sunday and resume talks over raising the debt ceiling and averting an unprecedented default that could have global implications. Biden left a group dinner a little early Friday to get an update from his negotiating team, the White House said.Biden not closing the door on sending fighter jets to Ukraine, Kirby saysMay 18, 202301:51""It's a minor miracle that Biden went ahead with the trip to Hiroshima,"" said Daniel Russel, former director of Asian affairs in the Obama White House. ""I'm glad he did and we should all pray that this gets wrapped up, because the consequences would be devastating -- and not only for the U.S. Everyone is concerned,"" he said referring to the debt ceiling fight.Beyond sanctions, Zelenskyy has asked for advanced F-16s to help repel Russian forces. The U.S. and its allies now plan to provide the fighter jets to Ukraine, a senior Biden administration official said Friday, although they may not necessarily come directly from the United States.For months, the Biden administration has declined to provide the planes out of concern that weapons capable of reaching Russian soil would risk escalating the war. But the U.S. has invited Ukrainian pilots to train on simulators to assess how long it would take them to learn to fly the aircraft.At the summit, Zelenskyy will have a fresh opportunity to engage with allies.“It’s very helpful,"" Russel said of Zelenskyy's visit. ""If the industrialized countries get Ukraine fatigue before Russia gets war fatigue and tired of fighting, then there’s going to be a big problem. Zelenskyy has been brilliant in ensuring that the world sees the situation for what it is, and that it doesn’t burn out and get tired.”The summit's location is symbolic of the mortal threat that is an everyday concern for Ukraine, as well as Asian countries living in the shadow of nuclear-armed China and North Korea.During World War II, the U.S. leveled Hiroshima with a single atomic bomb. On Friday morning, Biden and his counterparts toured the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum and met a woman who survived the attack.In the park outside, the leaders laid wreaths and planted a tree overlooking the skeletal remains of a once-domed building that Japan has preserved as a reminder of the bomb's toll.Peter NicholasPeter Nicholas is a senior national political reporter for NBC News.Kristen WelkerKristen Welker is chief White House correspondent for NBC News.Peter AlexanderPeter Alexander is chief White House correspondent for NBC News.Sally Bronston, Daryna Mayer and Yuliya Talmazan contributed ","{'neg': 0.091, 'neu': 0.803, 'pos': 0.105, 'compound': 0.8046}","251,13,13",Japan,"('36.5748441', '139.2394179')",36.5748441,139.2394179,"[('Biden', 19), ('Zelenskyy', 15), ('summit', 13), ('Russia', 12), ('war', 11)]"

He will also attend a meeting of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation trade ministers during his trip.In recent years, top U.S. and China commerce officials have rarely held meetings. Wang last spoke to Raimondo in 2021 in an introductory call, and he spoke with Tai on the sidelines of last year's APEC meeting. Tensions between the two superpowers have escalated under the Biden and Trump administrations, and relations in recent months have been further strained by the 200-foot-tall Chinese airship, which the U.S. called a spy balloon designed for eavesdropping.Still, the U.S. and China remain important trade partners. In 2022, bilateral trade hit a historic high of nearly $760 billion, according to the embassy briefing.""This fully demonstrates the strong complementarity between the two countries and resilience of the economic and trade relationship,"" Liu said. ""This bilateral relationship cannot be simplistically defined by 'competition.""Representatives for Raimondo and Tai did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The expected trade talks next week come after NBC News reported last month that a breakdown in communication between Washington and Beijing is raising the risk of an unintended crisis or conflict between the two nations.Rose HorowitchRose Horowitch is an intern with NBC News Digital Politics.

Australian woman, 95, is in critical condition after police fired stun gun at her02:22Link copiedMay 19, 2023, 2:00 PM UTCBy Lyme ChoA 95-year-old woman is in critical condition after police in Australia shocked her with a stun gun as she approached them with a walking frame and a steak knife at her nursing home.  Clare Nowland, who has dementia, was taken down by a senior constable, Peter Cotter, the assistant commissioner of New South Wales Police told a news conference Friday. At the time, ""she was approaching police, but it is fair to say at a slow pace,” he said. “She had a walking frame, but she had a knife.”He added that an internal investigation had been launched into the incident Wednesday at the Yallambee Lodge nursing home in Cooma, a small town around 240 miles south of Sydney.        After responding to a call about a patient having a knife in her possession, Cotter said Nowland was found in a “small confined” treatment room by two officers who arrived at the scene.Police fired a stun gun at Clare Nowland, 95, in a care home.Reuters TV“Negotiations commenced for her to drop the knife. For whatever reasons, Clare did not do that,” he said, adding that the senior constable activated his stun gun, which are widely known as Tasers after a major manufacturer. “I can’t take it any further as to what was going through anyone’s mind,” Cotter said.   The 5-foot-2 woman, who weighs 95 pounds, fell to the ground and struck her head.   Paramedics transferred Nowland to a nearby hospital where her head injury has rendered her bedridden. “She remains in and out of consciousness,” Cotter said.He added that she had left her bedroom and obtained the knife from the kitchen at Yallambee Lodge, a 93-room facility which “offers a range of accommodation and support options for those with higher care needs, dementia and respite care for both individuals and couples,” according to its website.NBC News has reached out to Yallambee Lodge for comment. Community advocate Andrew Thaler, who is assisting the family, said Friday that they were “shocked, confused, angry, and hurt” by the incident.“There was nothing she could do with the knife,” he said. “I bet all she could do was hurt herself. The police and the nurses are trained to treat people with dementia, if they can’t do that, why is she there?”The Yallambee Lodge facility in Cooma, Australia.Lukas Coch / APNowland, a long-standing member of the community, ran charity shops, was a regular churchgoer and cooked meals for the other elderly people through outreach work, Thaler said.“Clare is one of the ladies who gave more than she got,” he added. Thaler said her family of eight children and more than 60 grandchildren and great-grandchildren knew she was “old and at the end of her life line, but to suddenly have it cut short and ruined in such a way is shocking and confronting.” “It’s absurd,” he added.Cotter refused to answer any questions about criminal charges for the officer, but confirmed that he had served 12 years on the force. He added that the officer was “nonoperational at this stage while he is under review.” “Not one of our officers is above the law, and all our actions will be scrutinized robustly from a criminal and departmental perspective,” he said.The investigation was nominated a level 1 incident, which classifies injuries that lead to death or imminent death with exceptional circumstances. The classification ensures the highest level of inquiry with the inclusion of a homicide squad.“Critical incidents are a matter we are always transparent on,” Cotter said.Two police body cameras captured the incident, forming “a significant and integral part of the investigation,” but it will not be released because “it is not in the public interest,” he added. The investigation will be ultimately reviewed by the professional standards command of the South Wales Police Force, Cotter said, with oversight by the Law Enforcement Conduct Commission of New South Wales.Lyme ChoLyme Cho is an intern for NBC News based in London ","{'neg': 0.092, 'neu': 0.86, 'pos': 0.047, 'compound': -0.9908}","10,423,43",Australia,"('-24.7761086', '134.755')",-24.7761086,134.755,"[('said', 13), ('Cotter', 8), ('police', 7), ('knife', 7), ('95', 6)]"

In July 2021, the company was fined 200,000 yuan for publishing advertisements that featured a comedian endorsing a lingerie brand with comments said to objectify women.Reuter ","{'neg': 0.062, 'neu': 0.793, 'pos': 0.145, 'compound': 0.9925}","251,13,13",China,"('35.000074', '104.999927')",35.000074,104.999927,"[('China', 7), ('joke', 6), ('million', 6), ('\xa0', 6), ('Chinese', 6)]"

McCaul had threatened to hold Blinken in contempt of Congress for not turning over the classified document.""In light of this invitation, I will pause efforts to enforce the Committee’s subpoena pending my review of the documents,"" McCaul wrote. ""Please note, however, that the subpoena remains in full force and effect, and the acceptance of this accommodation does not waive any of the Committee’s rights regarding the subpoena.""He also insisted on ""allowing other Members to review the dissent cable and response.""Rep. Gregory Meeks of New York, the top Democrat on the Foreign Affairs Committee, will be allowed to view the documents with McCaul.The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on McCaul's letter.The State Department has made various counteroffers to McCaul's March subpoena, including providing a written summary of the cable’s contents in addition to a classified briefing. McCaul, however, has insisted that the committee receive a full copy of the cable, as well as Blinken’s response to it.The U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan was widely viewed as chaotic. A deadly attack at Abbey Gate at Kabul International Airport resulted in the deaths of 13 U.S. service members and 170 Afghan civilians.The Biden administration has blown past three deadlines for a congressional subpoena for the dissent cable, arguing that providing the sensitive memo to Congress would deter diplomats from using the channel to voice opposing views.The State Department said Wednesday it would let the top two members of the Foreign Affairs Committee — McCaul and Meeks — view the 2021 cable, according to a letter obtained by NBC News.“The accommodations that the Department has provided to date are extraordinary and, as stated in our prior correspondence, already create a serious risk of chilling both future use of, and future candor in, Dissent Channel cables,” said the letter from the assistant secretary for legislative affairs, Naz Durakoglu, which called the latest proposal “extraordinary.”The letter added that the State Department’s offer was contingent on the committee’s suspending all enforcement actions related to the subpoena, including dropping the threat to hold Blinken in contempt.McCaul on Wednesday called the offer “a significant step forward” but did not drop his contempt threat.Vedant Patel, a State Department spokesperson, defended the department's engagement Thursday.“I think it is natural in these discussions for there to be deliberations and accommodations about the path forward. I’m certainly not going to speculate and hypothesize on how we continue to further engage with the committee,” Patel told reporters. “What I will reiterate, though, is that at every turn we have offered tangible, fair and realistic accommodations that we think have sufficiently met and continue to sufficiently meet the committee’s request for information.”Abigail WilliamsAbigail Williams is a producer and reporter for NBC News covering the State Department.Ryan NoblesKate SantalizKate Santaliz is a researcher for NBC News’ Capitol Hill team.Megan Lebowit ","{'neg': 0.03, 'neu': 0.91, 'pos': 0.06, 'compound': 0.9623}","251,13,13",Texas,"('31.2638905', '-98.5456116')",31.2638905,-98.5456116,"[('McCaul', 13), ('State', 10), ('Department', 10), ('subpoena', 9), ('cable', 8)]"

Those include publications about the bloody crackdown and others written by pro-democracy politicians and political commentators.Hong Kong is a former British colony that returned to China’s rule in 1997, promising to retain its Western-style freedoms. But the city’s cultural and creative sectors said the city’s freedoms have shrunk since Beijing imposed a tough national security law following massive pro-democracy protests in 2019.Critics said the book pulling would further undermine Hong Kong’s reputation for having free access to information and freedom of expression.But Lee defended the sweeping law at the legislature, saying Hong Kong’s freedoms are protected by the city’s constitution.“The books we offer for residents to borrow are those that we recommend,” he said. “We would never recommend books that are illegal and violate copyrights. We would never recommend those that we deem to be featuring bad ideologies.”He said residents could still find such books to read elsewhere. He did not elaborate on what was considered “bad ideologies” and why the books were removed.Asked why the books were removed, the Leisure and Cultural Services Department said public libraries review and withdraw materials that do not conform to “the collection development” from time to time. If any material is suspected of being contrary to the interests of national security or violating laws, the libraries will immediately suspend services of the material in question for review, it said.The removal of the books was reported by local media outlets after a Chinese newspaper stopped publishing works by the city’s most prominent political cartoonist on Sunday following government complaints. Comic strip collections by the cartoonist were also no longer available in public libraries.Political scholar Ivan Choy said one book he co-authored was pulled despite a previous endorsement by former Secretary for Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Stephen Lam. Lam wrote the foreword for the title and said it was the most comprehensive book on the city’s electoral system, Choy said.“We wrote this book as academics and are not trying to make any political statements. So I feel they have overreacted,” he said.After the books were pulled and the publication of political cartoons halted, Choy questioned how Hong Kong could still stay as an international metropolitan without being broad-minded and inclusive. He added China wants Hong Kong to become an international cultural exchange center, where the East meets the West.He said the changes keep Hong Kong from living up to its reputation.Since a sweeping security law was enacted in 2020, the city’s art and media communities have learned to be wary of crossing vaguely defined red lines in producing art and other content that might be perceived as challenging the Chinese Communist Party’s control.The group that organized Hong Kong’s annual vigil in remembrance of the Tiananmen Square crackdown also voted to disband in 2021 under the shadow of the security law. The annual vigil was the only large-scale public commemoration of the event on Chinese soil and was attended by massive crowds until authorities banned it in 2020, citing anti-pandemic measures.Supporters say the group’s closure shows that the freedoms and autonomy promised when Hong Kong returned to China in 1997 are diminishing.This year, a massive vigil is unlikely to take place in its usual spot, Victoria Park in Causeway Bay, on June 4. Instead, some pro-Beijing groups will host a bazaar to celebrate the city’s handover to Chinese rule there.Associated Pres ","{'neg': 0.073, 'neu': 0.842, 'pos': 0.086, 'compound': 0.894}","251,13,13",Hong Kong,"('22.2793278', '114.1628131')",22.2793278,114.1628131,"[('Kong', 13), ('said', 13), ('Hong', 11), ('books', 11), ('city', 10)]"

Last week, Khan supporters had attacked public property and military installations after he was dragged out of a courtroom and detained.The popular opposition leader was released over the weekend and returned to his home in an upscale district of Lahore, Pakistan’s second largest city and the capital of the Punjab region.On Wednesday, Khan took to Twitter after 200 police officers surrounded the house, and a prison van appeared on the scene.“Probably my last tweet before my next arrest,” Khan tweeted. “ Police have surrounded my house.”Earlier on Wednesday, Amir Mir, a spokesman for the Punjab provincial government, said Khan has 24 hours to hand over 40 suspects allegedly hiding at his home or face a police raid.

Asim Munir, said in a speech to troops Wednesday that “recently planned and orchestrated tragic incidents will never be allowed again at any cost.”The advocacy group Amnesty International and the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan said they were alarmed by the government’s plan.Dinushika Dissanayake, Amnesty’s deputy regional director for South Asia, said that trying civilians in military courts is contrary to international law.Military trials in Pakistan are usually held behind closed doors, depriving civilians of some of their basic rights, including contracting a lawyer of their choice.A wave of violence had engulfed Pakistan’s capital and other urban areas following Khan’s dramatic arrest from a courtroom. Khan supporters torched buildings and vehicles and attacked police and military personnel and facilities. Ten people were killed in the clashes, and more than 4,000 were arrested.The Supreme Court later ordered Khan’s release and criticized the way he was arrested.On Wednesday, a top court in Islamabad extended Khan’s bail and protection from arrest until the end of the month. However, his legal team fears he might be arrested in old cases.Imran Khan granted bail, leaves high court amid tight securityMay 12, 202300:47Khan, 70, was ousted by a non-confidence vote in parliament last year. He is currently facing more than 100 cases, mainly on charges of inciting people to violence, threatening officials, and defying a ban on rallies. He also faces a graft case along with his wife.In recent days, the government of Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif has accused Khan of sheltering suspects linked to last week’s attacks.Khan, meanwhile, alleged some of his supporters were being tortured in police custody and demanded the immediate release of female detainees. He offered no evidence to back those claims.In a speech Wednesday, Khan said he never encouraged his supporters to engage in violence. He claimed the attacks on military installations were orchestrated by unknown elements — part of a purported conspiracy to pitch his party against the military — but did not provide evidence.Associated Pres ","{'neg': 0.114, 'neu': 0.848, 'pos': 0.039, 'compound': -0.9905}","10,423,43",Lahore,"('31.5656822', '74.3141829')",31.5656822,74.3141829,"[('Khan', 18), ('police', 8), ('Wednesday', 7), ('military', 7), ('said', 7)]"

But this is not a choice we are in a position to make. Because China has already embarked on a self-reliance drive, whether we want to decouple from their economy or not,” Truss said in an address to the Prospect Foundation at a hotel in the Taiwanese capital, Taipei.“China is growing its navy at an alarming rate and is undertaking the biggest military build-up in peacetime history,” she said.“They have already formed alliances with other nations that want to see the free world in decline. They have already made a choice about their strategy. The only choice we have is whether we appease and accommodate — or we take action to prevent conflict,” Truss said.Elsewhere, Truss praised her successor, Rishi Sunak, for describing China as “the biggest long-term threat to Britain” in comments last summer and for urging the closure of Chinese government-run cultural centers known as Confucius Institutes, which have been criticized as outlets for Communist Party propaganda. Such services could instead be provided by people from Taiwan and Hong Kong who come to the United Kingdom of their own volition.In Beijing, spokesperson for the Cabinet’s Taiwan Affairs Office Mao Xiaoguang accused Taiwan’s ruling Democratic Progressive Party of “spending the tax money of the Taiwanese people to bribe some anti-China politicians who have stepped down from office to stage a farce of seeking external support for independence in Taiwan.”Liz Truss with Taiwan Foreign Minister Joseph Wu upon her arrival at the Taoyuan airport Tuesday.APMa also renewed China’s military threats against Taiwan, a day after the Chinese Defense Ministry condemned U.S. military assistance to the island.“If they continue to challenge and force us, we will have to take decisive measures to defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity,” Ma told reporters at a biweekly news conference. “No one should underestimate our strong determination, unwavering will and strong ability.”Next year is seen by some as a crucial period for tense relations between the sides, with U.S. and Taiwanese voters going to the polls. Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen has served the maximum two terms and Vice President Lai Ching-te, a strong independence supporter, will be running for the DPP.Meanwhile, the main opposition Nationalist Party, or Kuomintang, on Wednesday nominated local politician Hou Yu-ih as its candidate in the January election. Hou rose to prominence as a top police official but has relatively little experience dealing with China and Taiwan’s international partners.Taiwan will also elect a new legislature, which is currently controlled by the ruling party.China’s relations with Britain and most other Western democracies have been in steep decline in recent years, largely as a result of disputes over human rights, trade technology and China’s aggressive moves toward Taiwan and in the South China Sea.Beijing’s relations with London have been especially bitter over China’s sweeping crackdown on free speech, democracy and other civil liberties in Hong Kong, a former British colony that was promised it would retain its freedoms after the handover to Chinese rule in 1997.China has said a key previous bilateral agreement on Hong Kong no longer applies and has rejected British expressions of concern as interference in China’s domestic political affairs. China has also been angered by a joint Australian-U.S.-British agreement known as AUKUS that would provide Australia with nuclear-powered submarines in part to counter the perceived rising threat from China.Truss, who served an ill-fated seven weeks as prime minister last year, also said China could not be trusted to follow through on its commitments in areas from trade to protection of the environment.And she praised Taiwan as “an enduring rebuke to totalitarianism” whose fate was a “core interest” to Europe.“A blockade or invasion of Taiwan would undermine freedom and democracy in Europe. Just as a Russian victory in Ukraine would undermine freedom and democracy in the Pacific,” Truss said.“We in the United Kingdom and the free world must do all we can to back you,” she said.Truss’ remarks also stood in stark contrast to published comments from French President Emmanuel Macron last month that elicited doubts about whether Macron’s views were in line with other European countries on Taiwan’s status.“The question we need to answer, as Europeans, is the following: Is it in our interest to accelerate (a crisis) on Taiwan? No,” Macron was quoted as saying in the interview. “The worst thing would be to think that we Europeans must become followers on this topic and take our cue from the U.S. agenda and a Chinese overreaction.”Shortly afterward, Macron denied any change on France’s views toward Taiwan, saying, “We are for the status quo, and this policy is constant.”Associated Pres ","{'neg': 0.088, 'neu': 0.8, 'pos': 0.112, 'compound': 0.9853}","251,13,13",China,"('35.000074', '104.999927')",35.000074,104.999927,"[('China', 19), ('Taiwan', 19), ('Truss', 14), ('\xa0', 8), ('said', 8)]"

Along with the Pheu Thai Party, the favored opposition group, Move Forward campaigned for reform of the military and the monarchy.Move Forward put those issues closer to the heart of its platform, earning a more radical reputation. Its outspoken support for minor reforms of the monarchy, while winning younger voters, antagonized conservatives committed to the royal institution.Incumbent Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, who came to power in a 2014 coup, was blamed for a stuttering economy, pandemic response shortcomings and thwarting democratic reforms — a particular sore point with younger voters.“This is people saying that we want change,” said Saowanee T. Alexander, a professor at Ubon Ratchathani University in northeastern Thailand. “They are saying that they could no longer take it. The people are very frustrated. They want change, and they could achieve it.”With more than 99% of ballots counted early Monday, Move Forward appeared to have a small edge over Pheu Thai, whose leaders conceded Sunday they might not finish on top following voter turnout of about 39 million, or 75% of registered voters.Prime ministerial candidate Pita Limjaroenrat, the Move Forward Party leader, celebrates Sunday in Bangkok. Sirachai Arunrugstichai / Getty ImagesMove Forward leader Pita Limjaroenrat tweeted that he is ready to bring about change should he be the country’s 30th prime minister.“Whether you agree or disagree with me, I will be your prime minister. Whether you have voted for me or not, I will serve you,” he wrote.Sunday’s winner is not assured the right to form the new government. A joint session of the 500-seat House of Representatives will be held with the 250-member Senate in July to select the prime minister, a process widely seen as undemocratic because the military appointed the senators, who will vote along with elected lawmakers.Move Forward captured just over 24% of the popular vote for the 400 constituency seats in the House of Representatives and nearly 36% for seats allocated in a separate nationwide ballot for 100 members elected by proportional representation.Supporters of the Move Forward Party cheer as they watch the counting of votes on television Sunday in Bangkok.Sakchai Lalit / APPheu Thai lagged slightly behind with just over 23% for constituency seats and about 27% for the party list.The tally of constituency votes gave 113 House seats to Move Forward and 112 to Pheu Thai, according to unofficial results Monday from the Election Commission.Prayuth’s United Thai Nation Party held the fifth spot in the constituency vote with almost 9% of the total, but placed third in the party-preference tally with close to 12% and 23 House seats in the constituency vote.The three parties were considered the most likely to head a new government. Paetongtarn Shinawatra, the 36-year-old daughter of billionaire former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, was favored in opinion polls to be the country’s next leader.Move Forward’s 42-year-old businessman leader Pita now seems a likely prospect.Pheu Thai won the most seats in the 2019 election. But its archrival, the military-backed Palang Pracharath Party, cobbled together a coalition with Prayuth as prime minister and unanimous support from conservative Senate members appointed by the military government after Prayuth’s coup.The Pheu Thai Party's prime ministerial candidate, Srettha Thavisin, leaves a news conference Sunday in Bangkok.Wason Wanichakorn / APUbon University’s Alexander cautioned that the current situation remains “very unpredictable” and the results could be unilaterally affected by the Election Commission, which previously disqualified opposition parties or otherwise undermined challenges to the conservative establishment.She noted the Bhumjaithai Party, which came in third, could be a “swing vote” since the combined Move Forward and Pheu Thai seats may not be enough for a majority coalition. Bhumjaithai controls a large bloc of votes in the northeast and helped put the military-backed coalition into power.Move Forward’s Pita is a possible target for what the opposition, from bitter experience, calls dirty tricks. A Palang Pracharath candidate last week filed a complaint with the Election Commission and the National Anti-Corruption Commission claiming Pita failed to list a stock shareholding on a statutory assets declaration. Pita denied any wrongdoing in the minor, technical claim.However, the leader of the Future Forward Party, forerunner of Move Forward, lost his Parliament seat on similar technical grounds. His party, also considered a radical challenge to the military-backed royalist establishment, was dissolved.Tyrell Haberkorn, a University of Wisconsin Thai studies scholar, said there is a chance street protests could be trigged again if Move Forward meets the same fate as its predecessor.“The time is up for the generals and their allies in the palace and the courts. The military can either listen to the voters and step down gracefully, or lead the country into chaos,” Haberkorn said.Associated Pres ","{'neg': 0.071, 'neu': 0.829, 'pos': 0.101, 'compound': 0.9643}","251,13,13",Thailand,"('14.8971921', '100.83273')",14.8971921,100.83273,"[('Forward', 16), ('\xa0', 12), ('military', 10), ('Party', 10), ('Thai', 9)]"

His detention came as China closed its borders and imposed tight domestic travel restrictions and social controls to fight the spread of Covid-19.Such investigations and trials are held behind closed doors, and little information is released other than vague accusations of infiltration, gathering secrets and threatening state security.Relations between Washington and Beijing are at their lowest in decades amid disputes over trade, technology, human rights and China’s increasingly aggressive approach toward its territorial claims involving self-governing Taiwan and the South China Sea. High-level government visits have been on hold and U.S. companies are delaying major investments amid mixed-messaging from Beijing.U.S. ambassador to China calls for resumption of high-level talksMay 5, 202304:13The sentencing comes as President Joe Biden heads to Hiroshima, Japan, for the Group of Seven major industrial nations summit, followed by a visit to Papua New Guinea, a Pacific island nation in a region where China has sought to increase its economic, military and diplomatic influence. After Beijing’s gains in the area, the U.S. and its Asia-Pacific partners stepped up their regional presence, offering investments and financial support rivaling those furnished by China.Now the world’s second-largest economy, China is expanding its footprint in ports, railways and other infrastructure from Europe to Southeast Asia and beyond.While the Suzhou court offered no indication of a tie to overall China-U.S. relations, spying charges are highly selective and evidence backing them up is not released. That is standard practice among most countries, which wish to secure their personal connections, networks and access to information.However, China’s authoritarian political system and the ruling Communist Party’s absolute control over legal matters, civil society and freedom of information forestall demands for further information, as well as court appeals.The U.S. Embassy had no immediate comment on Leung’s detention. The government of Hong Kong, a former British colony that reverted to Chinese control in 1997, also had no word on the case.When it was returned to China, Hong Kong was promised it would retain its financial, social and political liberties, but Beijing has essentially scuttled that commitment since cracking down on pro-democracy protesters and imposing a sweeping national security law in 2020.Chinese national security agencies have also raided the offices of foreign business consulting firms in Beijing and other cities as part of an ongoing crackdown on foreign businesses that provide sensitive economic data.Foreign companies operating in China have come under increasing pressure as Xi Jinping’s government tightens control over the economy. That stands in stark contrast to efforts to lure back foreign investors after draconian Covid-19 pandemic restrictions were lifted at the beginning of the year.Long pretrial detentions are not unusual in China and prosecutors have broad powers to hold people charged in national security cases, regardless of their citizenship status.Two Chinese Australians, Cheng Lei, who formerly worked for China’s state broadcaster, and writer Yang Jun, have been held since 2020 and 2019 respectively without word on their sentencing.Government suspicion is particularly focused on Chinese-born foreign citizens and people from Taiwan and Hong Kong, especially if they have political contacts or work in academia or publishing.Under Xi, the party has launched multiple campaigns against what it calls foreign efforts to sabotage its rule, without showing evidence. Universities have been ordered to censor discussions of human rights, modern Chinese history and ideas that could prompt questions about total Communist Party control.Xi’s government has also taken a hard line on foreign relations, most recently ordering out a Canadian diplomat in retaliation for Ottawa’s expulsion of a staffer at the Chinese Embassy accused of threatening a member of the Canadian parliament and his family members living in Hong Kong.That meshes with Xi’s confrontational global stance that has seen China partner with Russia in accusing the West of provoking Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine and seeking to overthrow the U.S.-led liberal dominance of global affairs.Associated Pres ","{'neg': 0.082, 'neu': 0.855, 'pos': 0.063, 'compound': -0.8459}","10,423,43",China,"('35.000074', '104.999927')",35.000074,104.999927,"[('China', 16), ('\xa0', 11), ('U.S.', 8), ('charges', 6), ('Hong', 6)]"

A languishing economy, earthquake-ravaged regions and a backlash against millions of Syrian refugees are among the issues that could end with his ouster. The hotly contested election pits him against Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, the joint candidate of an alliance of opposition parties, and Sinan Oğan, who is running as an independent. To win outright, a candidate needs 50% of the vote, but if no one crosses that mark, a runoff will be held May 28.Erdoğan holds steady lead over challenger, Turkish state media saysMay 14, 202302:44Voters will also elect 600 members of the Parliament, known as the Grand National Assembly. With or without Erdoğan, “I am not seeing any future for this country,” Demir, 52, said Wednesday by telephone from his home in the southern city of Hatay. Demir, a shopkeeper, said he lost hope in the state after he had to retrieve his wife’s body on his own from the rubble of the five-story apartment building, 48 hours after the quakes struck.  “My wife could have been rescued if the emergency workers were present at the site on time,” he said, adding that they arrived after three days, when it was too late.    Residents walk past the damaged remains of a building in Antakya, Turkey, last month.Boris Roessler / dpa/picture alliance via Getty Images fileNow living near their old home with his two teenage daughters in a container city — consisting of prefabricated housing units resembling shipping containers — Demir said he would not be voting for Erdoğan despite his apology for the government’s slow response after the earthquakes and his promise to build hundreds of thousands of new homes in the most affected areas. Elsewhere, Ferdi Baran, whose apartment building in Hatay was reduced to rubble in seconds, said he felt “distant” from all the candidates but was veering toward Erdoğan. “I feel offended at the government because they couldn’t efficiently intervene in the aftermath of the earthquake,” said Baran, 40, a furniture maker who is living with his wife, Sevsem, and two children in a tent city near their old home.He also said he felt offended by the opposition, who “didn’t really do anything except making propaganda against the government.”Sevsem and Ferdi Baran in sit in their tent in a tent city in Hatay province, Turkey.Neyran Elden / NBC NewsBut he said Erdoğan and his governing AK Party might be able to repair and rebuild areas affected by the earthquakes more quickly than a coalition of governing parties.Outside Turkey, the result will be watched with interest. The opposition alliance has signaled it would seek to rebuild ties with the U.S., the European Union and NATO. Erdoğan’s government has blocked Sweden’s accession into NATO, so if he were to lose, that veto might end.   Inside the country, Erdoğan will most likely have the backing of Turkey’s Syrian population, which numbers 3.7 million, making it the world’s largest refugee community. Syrian refugees were once welcomed as they fled their country’s civil war — now in its 12th year — but calls for them to return home have been revived amid a shortage of housing and shelters after the earthquake.     Both candidates running against Erdoğan have promised to send them back. Oğan, who is backed by an anti-migrant party, has said he would use “force if necessary,” while Kılıçdaroğlu has said he would repatriate them on a voluntary basis. Erdoğan has barely mentioned the migration issue on the campaign trail. But faced with a wave of backlash against refugees, his government has been seeking ways to resettle Syrians.    Nasir Muhammad said he didn’t “want to think about what would happen” if Erdoğan lost, because although he gained Turkish citizenship six years ago, some people still consider him a Syrian refugee.  Turkish presidential candidate Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu speaks to supporters at a rally in Istanbul this month. Burak Kara / Getty Images file“My Turkish neighbor told me that I had to pack my bags and prepare myself to leave if Erdoğan loses the election,” Muhammad, 51, said Thursday at the barbershop he founded in the southern city of Mersin. Marwan al-Hassan, who opened a car dealership in Istanbul after the earthquakes destroyed his home and business in Hatay, said he couldn’t return to Syria “because my life and the lives of my children are in danger there.” Hassan, 45, said President Bashar al-Assad’s regime would kill him if he went back. If worse comes to worst, he said, he would try to go to Europe. While there has been “a rising nationalist, anti-immigrant wave strong across the board,” for Karabekir Akkoyunlu, a lecturer in Middle Eastern politics at SOAS University of London, the economy in Turkey, where inflation soared above 85% last year, is “the single most important reason Erdoğan faces potential defeat in the polls.” “Turkey has been in an economic crisis since 2018,” he said, adding that the inflation rates had “hit households across the board.” Turkey's Erdoğan trails opponent ahead of electionMay 12, 202304:18Most of Erdoğan’s base, he said, “appears convinced that his government is not to blame for the tens of thousands of lives lost.”“They either buy the official argument that this was a catastrophe of biblical proportions which no government could do anything about, or they blame smaller actors, like contractors, ignoring the political system that made extensive corruption and nepotism possible,” he said. He added, however, that “the actual impact on the polls will also depend on whether the earthquake survivors will be able to vote, given that many of them have been displaced.”Only 133,000 people across the entire country have reregistered at new addresses outside their homes, according to Turkey’s Supreme Election Council. The International Organization for Migration said in March that almost 3 million people had been displaced after the earthquakes. That means many will have to travel to vote, like businessman Ali Catal, 51, and his family, who will make the 650-mile journey from İzmir back to their former home in Hatay to vote.      “These elections are very important to us, not only for us, but for everyone living in this country,” he said.Neyran Elden reported from Istanbul and Ammar Cheikh Omar from Mersin.Neyran EldenAmmar Cheikh OmarAmmar Cheikh Omar is a producer for NBC News ","{'neg': 0.082, 'neu': 0.856, 'pos': 0.062, 'compound': -0.9782}","10,423,43",Turkey,"('38.9597594', '34.9249653')",38.9597594,34.9249653,"[('said', 20), ('\xa0', 19), ('Erdoğan', 18), ('Turkey', 13), ('country', 8)]"

Turkish parliamentary candidate Zeynep Esmeray Ozadikti in Istanbul in April.Sedat Suna / EPA via ShuttersockLink copiedMay 12, 2023, 4:30 PM UTCBy Kristina JovanovskiISTANBUL — Esmeray Zeynep Ozadikti says she may land in jail for running as an openly trans woman in Turkey’s election. Still, she believes it’s worth it.Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his Justice and Development Party (AKP) have targeted the LGBTQ community as they appeal to their Islamist, conservative base ahead of Sunday’s elections for president and parliament. The upcoming vote is expected to be Erdogan’s biggest electoral challenge in over 20 years in power. One of Ozadikti’s competitors in Istanbul’s Second District is Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu, who has also made anti-LGBT remarks while campaigning.“Should they win, their first act would probably be arresting me,” Ozadikti, 50, said this week.“Hate takes time, hate takes mental resources, hate takes emotio   nal resources.” TIP candidate Talya Aydin \Homosexuality is not illegal in Turkey and there are pockets of tolerance in places like Istanbul, where same-sex couples walk down the street in liberal areas holding hands.But Turkey is a conservative country and anti-LGBTQ discrimination is common. ILGA-Europe, the European chapter of the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association, ranked Turkey 48 out of 49 countries when it comes to LGBTQ rights and acceptance last year (behind only Azerbaijan). Under Erdogan, outright discrimination has gotten worse in recent years. Pride parades, which were peaceful for years and attracted tens of thousands, began being banned in 2015. Police used water cannons and rubber pellets on marchers who defiantly marched regardless.The parades have continued with protesters playing a cat-and-mouse game with riot police who try to stop the marchers by blocking off access to streets.Riot police face off with a Pride march participant on June 26.Kemal Aslan / AFP via Getty Images fileAnd members of the community have also faced outright threats to their lives. According to the LGBTQ advocacy group Kaos, there were eight killings in 2021 motivated by hate, although it said the number is likely much higher as most would not have been reported.“I have known and lost so many of my friends, so many of my trans woman friends, to murders, and now after their generation, now I see the Z generation and I see now that I’m also losing my daughters and my sons and my children to murders, as well,” Ozadikti said. “This election isn’t just about getting rid of the old system but building a more equitable one for the future.”The road into politics for Ozadikti, a former mussels-stand seller, has been long and twisted.She moved from a small town near the Armenian border in northeastern Turkey to Istanbul when she was a teenager. Later, her feminist activism and work in theater as an actor, tackling topics on sexual identity and rape, have made her a minor celebrity. In her quest to improve conditions for her community, Ozadikti says she approached the main opposition party, the secularist Republican People’s Party (CHP), but did not find them inclusive enough. President Erdogan visits Turkish earthquake victimsFeb. 8, 202301:20Eventually, she met with members of the Workers’ Party of Turkey (TIP), which suggested she run as a candidate.While it polls in the low single digits, the small, leftist party has attracted young voters, and its participation in an alliance could give it increased influence in parliament if Erdogan’s coalition loses control.  TIP says it has six openly LGBTQ candidates running in the parliamentary elections across the country, with Ozadikti the most likely to win. If she does, she would be Turkey’s first openly LGBTQ member of parliament. With one week to go before the election, Ozadikti sat in a cafe alongside her fellow party members in the Istanbul district she is competing in. With multiple MPs coming out of Istanbul’s Second District, both she and the interior minister could end up representing the same area at the same time.While politics can be a tough business the world over, the attacks lodged at her by Soylu have been especially dangerous. While connecting the opposition to the LGBTQ community, Soylu, who is also a deputy chairman of Erdogan’s party, has said that if the opposition wins, people would be allowed to marry animals. “Him saying such words, of course we are human, it gets to our emotions,” she said. Ozadikti said Soylu’s remarks could be a particularly potent threat to the LGBTQ community because, as the interior minister, he has the resources of the police. Erdogan himself has repeatedly stated that the opposition has ties with the LGBTQ community, and during a rally on Sunday claimed the opposition is “pro-LGBT.”When asked about the comment, Ozadikti and her colleagues started laughing.“It’s a very desperate statement,” she said.                Alev Ozkazanc, professor emeritus of politics and gender studies at Ankara University, said the anti-LGBTQ rhetoric in the election is unprecedented.So the impact of Ozkazanc and other trans candidates goes beyond their possible victories, she said because even if one of them does not get elected, their candidacies alone send a message to the public.  “The symbolic value is that trans people are there, LGBT people are there, amongst us. They are equal citizens who have the right to be elected as any other citizen,” Ozkazanc said.Erdogan’s main challenger, Kemal Kilicdaroglu from the CHP, leads an alliance of six parties that includes ultranationalists and conservative Islamists.Supporters of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan wave Turkish national flags during a rally in Istanbul on Friday.Ozan Kose / AFP - Getty ImagesTIP has partnered with the influential pro-Kurdish party, the HDP, and their support may be needed by the coalition that wins the most seats in parliament to pass any laws.A fellow TIP candidate, Talya Aydin, 26, said her party would seek  justice for  crimes that she said had not been properly investigated if the opposition alliance becomes the largest group in parliament.She cites the death of Hande Kader, a trans woman activist whose killing led to hundreds of people protesting in Istanbul, as well as charges against demonstrators who marched in banned Pride parades.Like Ozadikti, Aydin said her transgender identity puts her at an increased risk of ending up behind bars if Erdogan is re-elected.“It only makes me work harder so he doesn’t win,” she said.Prison is not the only threat she feels she faces. Aydin transitioned last year and said she now takes pictures of taxi cabs’ license plates before entering, and no longer walks home at night with her headphones on.But, she added, she is seeing more acceptance for her community in Turkish society despite the political rhetoric.The struggling economy, a key reason Erdoğan’s popularity has waned, has meant many people are not being influenced by the anti-LGBTQ rhetoric — they are just too concerned with making ends meet. “Hate takes time, hate takes mental resources, hate takes emotional resources,” she said.Kristina Jovanovsk ","{'neg': 0.075, 'neu': 0.83, 'pos': 0.095, 'compound': 0.9666}","251,13,13",Turkey,"('38.9597594', '34.9249653')",38.9597594,34.9249653,"[('said', 16), ('\xa0', 15), ('LGBTQ', 14), ('Erdogan', 12), ('Ozadikti', 12)]"

By Friday the hashtag had received almost 400 million views on the Twitter-style site, which is heavily censored by government moderators. “You were my idol, but not anymore,” one user wrote. Another wrote that Taiwan was “an inseparable part of China,” reflecting Beijing's policy toward the island, which sits around 100 miles off China's southeastern coast.Beijing views Taiwan as an illegitimate breakaway province that is part of China's territory. When the civil war in China between the communists and nationalists ended in 1949 with the former triumphant, the latter set up a rival government in Taipei.Since the 1970s, the U.S. has officially only recognized China. Under the “One China” policy, Washington acknowledges Beijing’s position that Taiwan is part of China without endorsing it and maintains unofficial relations with Taipei.In addition to social media backlash, Howard was criticized by China's hawkish state-run nationalist tabloid, The Global Times. In an editorial, the newspaper called for him to apologize.Its former editor, Hu Xijin, also took to Weibo to accuse Howard of being a “person who is hasty and seeks immediate benefits.” He said that Howard was making “fast money” in Taiwan because he is aware of his fading popularity.Howard moved to clarify his comments Friday during a visit to a primary school in northern Taiwan.“If I offended anyone in China, I apologize,” he said. “It was not my intention to harm anyone with what I said in the commercial.”He added that when he used the word “country,” he did not mean that Taiwan was a sovereign nation. However, some Weibo users were less than impressed. “This is not an apology, this is just sophistry,” one wrote.U.S. is ready for high-level talks with China, American ambassador saysMay 3, 202303:22This is not the first time a basketball star has incurred the wrath of Chinese social media users.In 2021, then-Boston Celtics center Enes Kanter was widely criticized after he posted a video to social media in which he labeled Chinese President Xi Jinping a “brutal dictator” and voiced support for Tibet’s independence. Tencent, which as the NBA’s digital streaming partner in China attracts a half-billion viewers a season, later pulled a broadcast of the Celtics’ game against the New York Knicks, and searches for Kanter’s name appeared to have been blocked on Weibo. The center later changed his name to Enes Kanter Freedom.Two years earlier, then-Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey apologized for a tweet in support of pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong after several sponsors bailed on the team.

He says Khan is now “a free man,” and that the decision was just.The ruling came after Khan returned to court to hear whether he will be shielded from renewed arrest or taken back into custody — a decision that put the government and legions of Khan supporters on edge after days of violent confrontations.The popular 70-year-old opposition leader appeared before the same court from which he was dragged and arrested on Tuesday. The arrest triggered nationwide protests in which his supporters attacked military installations, burned vehicles, and ambulances and looted general stores in various parts of the country. The government responded with a crackdown, arresting nearly 3,000 people.Friday’s court session is part of a series of complex legal maneuvers.On Thursday, Pakistan’s Supreme Court declared that Khan’s arrest was unlawful, but then asked the Islamabad High Court — a lower court — to reconsider its initial decision to uphold the arrest.The Supreme Court said it would respect whatever the Islamabad court rules on Friday.In an initial brief session of the Islamabad court Friday, the judges heard a request by Khan seeking protection from arrest on the graft charges. As Khan’s supporters in the courtroom chanted, the judge adjourned the session for two hours. Outside, other supporters set fire to a police vehicle when security forces prevented them from approaching the court building.Khan's supporters celebrated after his released was ordered on Thursday.Anjum Naveed / APThe government has said it would quickly re-arrest Khan if the Islamabad High Court upholds its earlier ruling that the initial arrest was legal. It could also take him into custody on other charges if he is granted protection in the corruption cases, the Interior Ministry said Thursday.The government contends that Khan’s release rewards and encourages mob violence. In court Friday, Khan’s chief lawyer Babar Awan told reporters that the government seemed to be adamant about arresting the former prime minister.Khan’s arrest on Tuesday was a startling and controversial move — agents from the National Accountability Bureau burst into the Islamabad High Court where Khan was attending a session on other charges and dragged him away, putting him into an armored vehicle. The Supreme Court ruled that the arrest was “invalid and unlawful” because it took place from the court premises, violating Khan’s right to justice.The violence that ensued left at least 10 Khan supporters dead. Dozens of protesters and more than 200 police officers were injured. Protesters torched trucks, cars and police vehicles and blocked highways. Nearly 3,000 supporters from Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party have been arrested, including Khan’s deputies.Khan’s supporters on Friday again resorted to violence, setting fire to a police vehicle not far from the court where he was appearing. The police stopped them from reaching near the court.The controversy surrounding Khan — a figure who inspires both vehement loyalty and furious opposition — threatens to open a deeper vein of turmoil in a country that has seen multiple military takeovers and bouts of violence. The unrest has echoed that which followed the 2007 assassination of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto during an election rally. Her supporters at the time, outraged by her killing, rampaged for days across Pakistan.Khan, a former cricket star turned Islamist politician, was removed as prime minister last year by a no-confidence vote in Parliament and now leads the opposition. He faces more than 100 legal cases, most involving allegations that he incited violence and threatened police and government officials.He also faces at least three graft cases, including accusations from the National Accountability Bureau that he accepted millions of dollars worth of property in exchange for providing benefits to a real estate tycoon. A new terrorism charge was filed against him on Thursday for allegedly inciting his followers to violence after his arrest.Following the Supreme Court’s release order Thursday, Khan spent the night at a government guest house in Islamabad, where he met with family members and friends.Pakistan braces itself for further unrest after Imran Khan's arrestMay 11, 202301:14Pakistan’s president, Arif Alvi, also had a meeting with him. Alvi has been trying to defuse tension between Khan and Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif’s government to avoid an escalation.Speaking at a special Cabinet meeting Friday to discuss the developments, Sharif criticized the Supreme Court ruling, saying there was a “genuine corruption case” against Khan, “but the judiciary has become a stone wall protecting him.”As Sharif’s government contends with the political turmoil amid a worsening economic crisis, it is also dealing with militant attacks. According to Pakistan’s military, two soldiers were killed and three were wounded Friday when insurgents attacked a security post in the town of Muslim Bagh in southwestern Baluchistan province. It said two insurgents were also killed in the exchange of fire.Associated Pres ","{'neg': 0.168, 'neu': 0.721, 'pos': 0.111, 'compound': -0.9976}","10,423,43",Pakistan,"('30.3308401', '71.247499')",30.3308401,71.247499,"[('Khan', 28), ('court', 14), ('arrest', 12), ('supporters', 10), ('Court', 9)]"

It echoed unrest that followed the 2007 assassination of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto during an election rally in the garrison city of Rawalpindi. Her supporters at the time, outraged by her killing, rampaged for days across Pakistan.Clashes with police since Khan’s dramatic arrest on Tuesday have left at least 10 of his supporters dead and dozens injured, along with more than 200 policemen injured. Demonstrators burned down a railway station on the outskirts of the capital, Islamabad, on Wednesday night. On Thursday, they clashed with police in neighborhoods around Pakistan’s second largest city, Lahore, setting fire to a police car and blocking a train.Police said Thursday that nearly 1,600 of Khan supporters were arrested overnight around the country on charges of damaging public property and attacking military installations, bringing the total of those detained since Tuesday to 2,300.The arrests followed mob attacks on government and military buildings, with protesters torching trucks, cars and police vehicles in the streets and blocking highways. In one incident hours after Khan’s arrest, a mob set fire Tuesday to the sprawling residence of a top army commander in Lahore.Khan was dragged from a courtroom in Islamabad where he showed up to face graft charges on Tuesday. He is now being held at a police compound in Islamabad where, at a temporary court, a judge on Wednesday ordered the 70-year-old opposition leader detained for at least another eight days, raising the prospect of more unrest.After briefly hearing a petition from Khan’s lawyer, the Supreme Court on Thursday expressed displeasure over the manner in which Khan was arrested and ordered authorities to present him before it in an hour, raising speculation it would order him freed. Khan’s lawyer had sought his release, arguing that the arrest was illegal.As police took Khan on Thursday to the Supreme Court amid tight security, the government demanded he remain in custody.“It would be unfair if you give any reprieve to him,” Information Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb told a news conference, addressing the top court’s chief justice. She pointed to violence carried out by Khan’s followers, saying the court would be giving a “license to kill to everyone” if the former premier is freed.Separately Thursday, police filed new terrorism charges against Khan and top leaders from his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party on charges of inciting mobs to violence.In an address to the nation late Wednesday, Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif — who took over after Khan was removed in April last year in a no-confidence vote in Parliament — said the unrest by the former premier’s followers had “damaged sensitive public and private property,” forcing him to deploy the military in Islamabad, in Punjab — Pakistan’s most populous province — and in volatile regions of the northwest.“Such scenes were never seen by the people of Pakistan,” Sharif said, following a Cabinet meeting. “Even patients were taken out of ambulances and ambulances were set on fire.”Sharif called the attacks “unforgivable,” and warned that those involved in violence would be given exemplary punishment. He said Khan was arrested because of his involvement in corruption, and that there was evidence backing up these charges.Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, the late Benazir Bhutto’s son, urged Khan’s followers on Thursday to end the violence but stressed that peaceful protests are their right. “What has happened, has happened. Don’t make things more difficult for yourself,” he said.Following the violence, the government shut down schools, colleges and universities in Punjab and northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provinces, where Khan has a massive grassroots following and where most of the violence was reported. At least seven of the protester deaths so far have been reported in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and two in Punjab’s capital Lahore, along with one in the southwestern city of Quetta. The government also suspended internet service in various parts of the country.“We will arrest all those who disrupted law and order,” said Mohson Naqvi, the chief minister in Punjab.Officials say Khan’s supporters in particular targeted military installations because he has been blaming the military for his 2022 ouster, while also claiming it was a conspiracy by Washington and Sharif’s government — charges that both the United States and Khan’s successor have denied. The military has also said it played no role in Khan’s ouster.Amid the violence, Khan supporters have attacked the military headquarters in Rawalpindi and security posts in the northwest, torching the security Chakdara fort on the border with Afghanistan. In Lahore on Tuesday night, demonstrators ransacked and burned down the residence of the regional commander, Lt. Gen. Salman Fayyaz Ghani.The military vowed on Wednesday to respond to attacks by demonstrators with full force. It said the attacks on its installations were launched in an orchestrated manner, and the violence was a “black chapter” in the country’s history.The military has directly ruled Pakistan for more than half of the 75 years since the country gained independence from British colonial rule and wields considerable power over civilian governments.Associated Pres ","{'neg': 0.139, 'neu': 0.791, 'pos': 0.07, 'compound': -0.9976}","10,423,43",Pakistan,"('30.3308401', '71.247499')",30.3308401,71.247499,"[('Khan', 27), ('violence', 13), ('military', 10), ('arrest', 9), ('\xa0', 9)]"

He was named candidate of a six-party opposition alliance and also heads the Republican People’s Party (CHP), the banner under which İnce unsuccessfully ran for president in 2018.Erdoğan’s re-election bid has been complicated by a cost-of-living crisis, triggered by a lira slump and soaring inflation, and a devastating earthquake in February which killed more than 50,000 people in Turkey and left millions homeless.İnce, who had 2.2% support in the Konda poll, said he had been the target of a smear campaign including fake videos and documents being circulated on social media, and he accused journalists and prosecutors of not doing their jobs.“I am not afraid of plots, fake video edits, invoices and non-existent jeeps. I have been resisting these for 45 days already,” he said, adding that some people had accused him of working with Erdoğan to prevent Kılıçdaroğlu’s election.“I am withdrawing from the candidacy. I am doing this for my country,” he said.He did not back another candidate and asked people to vote for his party in the parliamentary elections.“There is no doubt that Erdoğan is facing a majority that wants change — and that includes younger people,” said Asli Aydıntaşbaş, a Brookings Institution visiting fellow. “The only question is whether folks believe Kılıçdaroğlu is that agent of change.”Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, the leader of the Republican People's Party is leading in the polls ahead of Sunday's presidential election.Burak Kara / Getty Images“Whether he barely wins or not, I feel like the Erdoğan era is over,” she added. “Turkish society is ready to move on. And sadly President Erdoğan is not leaving behind an institutional governance model.”Down to the wireThe Konda survey put support for the fourth presidential candidate, Sinan Oğan, at 4.8%. Konda had said the majority of Oğan’s and İnce’s voters were leaning towards voting for Kılıçdaroğlu in a second round.A Metropoll survey also showed the vote going to a second round, with Kılıçdaroğlu getting 49.1% and Erdoğan 46.9%. In a run-off, it showed Kılıçdaroğlu winning with 51.3%.Konda put support for Erdoğan’s ruling alliance on 44.0% in the parliamentary vote, ahead of the main opposition alliance on 39.9%. The pro-Kurdish HDP party, which is backing Kılıçdaroğlu, is expected to play a “kingmaker” role.Konda said the HDP, running under another party’s emblem due to the threat of a court ban, and its leftist allies are seen winning 12.3% of support in the parliamentary vote. That would leave Erdoğan and his allies in the minority.Konda, which publicly releases only one poll ahead of votes, undertook face-to-face interviews with 3,480 people across 35 provincial centers. The survey has a margin of error of +/- 2.2% at 99% confidence level, Konda said.Reuter ","{'neg': 0.056, 'neu': 0.85, 'pos': 0.094, 'compound': 0.9743}","251,13,13",Turkey,"('38.9597594', '34.9249653')",38.9597594,34.9249653,"[('Erdoğan', 14), ('Kılıçdaroğlu', 12), ('İnce', 9), ('said', 8), ('ahead', 7)]"

""Or not go.""Biden plans to attend a summit of the Group of Seven major industrial countries in Hiroshima, Japan, to discuss the response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and tensions with China, followed by a “Quad” meeting in Sydney on May 24 with Japanese Prime Minister Kishida Fumio, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.Biden is also set to visit Papua New Guinea on his way to Australia to discuss regional security and economic and climate support, the White House said. It would be the first time a sitting U.S. president has visited the Pacific island nation.Biden has said that responsibility for raising the nation’s borrowing limit falls on Congress and that he will accept only a bill to raise the borrowing limit with no strings attached. Republicans are trying to use the threat of default as leverage to force concessions on federal spending.Failure to break the deadlock threatens the possibility of default on the nation's $31.4 trillion debt, an outcome that could trigger panic on Wall Street and bode possible political ramifications for Biden heading into his re-election campaign.  Asked whether he agreed with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy’s assertion that congressional leaders had to reach a deal in principle by early next week, Biden demurred, telling reporters Wednesday that he was “not going to make those kinds of judgments.”“I’ve been involved in negotiations my whole career,” Biden added. “Some negotiations happen in the last second. Some negotiations happen way ahead of time. So we’ll see.”Biden and congressional leaders had an acrimonious sit-down Tuesday that McCarthy, R-Calif., characterized to Republican members as a waste of time. The group is due to meet again Friday before Biden is scheduled to depart for Asia next week.The fight over raising the debt ceiling has evoked the brinkmanship that took place a decade ago when President Barack Obama tussled with congressional Republicans over the same issue.In October 2013, Obama canceled a planned trip to Asia so he could remain in Washington to negotiate an end to a government shutdown and reach a deal that would raise the debt limit. Ten years later, Biden finds himself in a similar situation. He is scheduled to leave for Japan next week for a series of meetings with his foreign counterparts. If he skips the trip to remain at the negotiating table in Washington, he would miss a key opportunity to rally U.S. allies in curbing China’s military and economic ambitions.But if he decides to go, he would be halfway around the world as the deadline approaches for an unprecedented default.Biden first warned Tuesday that the standoff could throw the Asia trip into disarray.“I’m still committed, but obviously, this is the single most important thing that’s on the agenda,” he said after a meeting with congressional leaders at the White House.Biden said skipping the trip was “not likely” but added, “It is possible.”“If somehow we got down to the wire and we still hadn’t resolved this and the due date was in a matter of when I was supposed to be away, I would not go,” Biden said. “I would stay until this gets finished.”Jason Furman, a top economic adviser to Obama during his presidency, said Biden may not need to be in Washington to break the impasse.“Presidents don’t need to negotiate everything personally themselves,” Furman said in an interview. “He has good people around him who are trusted and respected on these issues.“So my hope is that the government can do more than one thing at once, but you never know.”Katherine DoyleKatherine Doyle is a White House reporter for NBC News.

The others made it out safely.The death has raised questions about why school officials chose to go ahead with the trip even after forecasters had warned that heavy rain was approaching.The district council website cautions people to “check weather forecast as caves can be prone to flash flooding.” The site says the cave system features dramatic limestone outcrops, sink holes and three significant caves.“We acknowledge this event has been very distressing for the school and wider community, and that there are a number of questions the public will have,” Police Superintendent Tony Hill said in a statement. “At the moment, police’s focus is on supporting those affected.”Hill said the body was recovered late Tuesday.Whangārei Boys’ High School Principal Karen Gilbert-Smith wrote on Facebook that the event was “hugely upsetting” for all those involved.“In time we will seek to understand how this situation occurred, but for now I ask that we stay united as a WBHS community and provide support where required,” the principal wrote.Further south, the heavy rainfall and flooding Tuesday prompted authorities in Auckland to declare a state of emergency. The declaration remained in place Wednesday morning as the weather eased.Fire and emergency crews said they responded to more than 200 calls on Tuesday, most of them in Auckland. Many were for floodwaters entering buildings, but they had also responded to landslides, falling trees and trapped cars.

Police said 945 of his supporters had been arrested in Punjab province after 25 police vehicles and more than 14 government buildings were set on fire.Imran Khan says he’s being treated like ‘some lethal terrorist’March 15, 202301:46“This can’t be tolerated. The law will take its course,” Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal said at a news conference. “These violent attacks were not the outcome of any public outpouring. They were planned by the PTI rank and file.”Authorities in three of Pakistan’s four provinces have imposed an emergency order banning all gatherings after Khan’s supporters clashed with police.Khan, 70, was arrested from the Islamabad High Court by Pakistan’s anti-corruption agency. Police said a court hearing would take place at the police guest house where he was being held in the Islamabad police lines area.PTI has called for supporters to gather in the capital and for a “shutdown” across the country of 220 million.His arrest came a day after the powerful military rebuked him for repeatedly accusing a senior military officer of trying to engineer his assassination and the former armed forces chief of being behind his removal from power last year.Police detain a supporter of former Prime Minister Imran Khan during a protest in Peshawar on Wednesday.Abdul Majeed / AFP - Getty ImagesPakistan’s Dawn newspaper said in an editorial that “the nature and locus of the protests that broke out following Mr Khan’s arrest yesterday signal that public anger is also directed at the military”.Khan was due to appear for two hearings on Wednesday, Geo News reported, including for a corruption case related to property and another case that alleges Khan unlawfully sold state gifts during his 2018-22 tenure as premier. Khan has denied wrongdoing.The Pakistani rupee fell 1.3% to a record-low of 288.5 against the U.S. dollar on Wednesday, while the 100-index of the Pakistan Stock Exchange dropped 0.7% in early trading before recouping its losses.An International Monetary Fund bailout package for Pakistan has been delayed for months even though its foreign exchange reserves are barely enough to cover a month’s imports.Supreme Court challengePTI Vice Chairman Shah Mahmood Qureshi said the party’s senior leadership was in Islamabad to meet Khan and would approach the Supreme Court to challenge an Islamabad High Court order that deemed Khan’s arrest legal.“We continue to call PTI family workers, supporters and the people of Pakistan onto the streets for peaceful protest against this unconstitutional behaviour,” Qureshi wrote on Twitter.The protests have disrupted business in several cities. In Peshawar, chicken seller Malagul Khan said his shop and others were destroyed in the clashes.Pakistan braced for more turmoil a day after Khan was dragged from court in Islamabad and his supporters clashed with police across the country. Muhammad Sajjad / APRaja Imran, 25, also a Peshawar resident, said, “There is total chaos across the country ... There are exams going on and school children will suffer”.Khan was ousted as prime minister in April 2022 in a parliamentary no-confidence vote. He has not slowed his campaign against the ouster even though he was wounded in a November attack on his convoy as he led a protest march to Islamabad calling for snap general elections.The corruption case is one of more than 100 registered against Khan since his ouster after four years in power. In most of the cases, Khan faces being barred from holding public office if convicted, with a national election scheduled for November.“Imran Khan will have to face the law and if he is cleared he will be contesting elections and if he is found guilty he will have to face the consequences,” Iqbal, the minister, said.Reuter ","{'neg': 0.131, 'neu': 0.79, 'pos': 0.08, 'compound': -0.9932}","10,423,43",Pakistan,"('30.3308401', '71.247499')",30.3308401,71.247499,"[('Khan', 21), ('\xa0', 14), ('Pakistan', 11), ('supporters', 11), ('said', 11)]"

After Russia said it was in full control of battle-scarred Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine — a claim denied by Zelenskyy — the Ukrainian leader said it was unfair to compare Bakhmut to the first city to suffer a nuclear attack.  But speaking in Hiroshima, which hosted the three-day summit for the leaders of the world's seven largest economies, he said photos of the city where the U.S. dropped an atomic bomb in 1945 “absolutely remind me of Bakhmut and other cities like it.” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy meets with President Joe Biden during the G7 Leaders' Summit in Hiroshima, Japan, on May 21, 2023.Brendan Smialowski / AFP - Getty ImagesHe said there was “absolutely, nothing alive there, all buildings are destroyed, there is even no understanding where a street is and where a building is. Absolute total destruction. Nothing left, no people left.” Today, he said Hiroshima was “a modern city that looks alive, with respect to people and values,” adding that he believed the same would happen in Bakhmut and other towns and villages. Zelenskyy hadn’t been expected to appear at the summit in person, but after he arrived on a French plane Saturday dressed in his signature green military fatigues, he was warmly welcomed by the other leaders, including President Joe Biden, whom he met with on Sunday.He said that Ukraine was expecting to receive “high-quality weapons” from all countries in the G7, which includes Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Canada and the United States.“We will get the jets,” he said. “So far, I cannot say how many of them, this is not a secret, I truly don’t know that yet.”His comments came after Wagner mercenary chief Yevgeny Prigozhin, whose fighters led the costly Russian push for Bakhmut, claimed Saturday to have finally captured the city. Russia’s Defense Ministry also said in a Telegram post that the city’s “liberation” had been completed.Zelenskyy holds diplomatic talks with world leaders at G7 summitMay 20, 202301:22Disputing the claims, Zelenskyy said his forces were “holding on” and “fighting thanks to courage of our people and warriors, and thanks to our intelligence.” Moscow focused on seizing Bakhmut over the winter in the hopes of a much needed success that could also serve as a stepping stone to the rest of the surrounding industrial heartland known as the Donbas.

Bakhmut has been the site of some of the heaviest battles with the Russian troops, pictured here on Feb. 27, 2023. Yevhen Titov / APAsked if the city was under Russian control he said, “I think no, but you have to understand there is nothing. They destroyed our city. There are no buildings. It’s a pity, a tragedy but for today Bakhmut is only in our hearts. There is nothing of this place, just ground and a lot of dead Russians.”  He added that Ukrainian defenders “did strong work in the city.”Zelenskyy's spokesman, Sergii Nykyforov, later clarified on Facebook that his’ “no” was referring to Russia’s assertion that it had taken the city.Wagner mercenary chief Yevgeny Prigozhin, whose fighters led the costly Russian push for the city, claimed Saturday to have finally captured it. Russia’s Defense Ministry also said in a Telegram post that the city’s “liberation” had been completed.

Ukraine sought to wear down Russian forces by forcing a protracted fight that turned into the longest and bloodiest of the war, buying time for its military to prepare a crucial counteroffensive.In recent days Kyiv's troops have clawed back ground on the city’s flanks, exposing bitter divisions between the Kremlin’s military leaders, and leading an angry Prigozhin to say his troops inside the city were at risk of encirclement.The city's symbolic weight had grown with each day that Ukrainian defenders held out against waves of Russian attacks. That resistance became a point of national pride, with the phrase ""Bakhmut holds"" becoming a daily patriotic rallying cry. It holds no longer, but Kyiv may believe it has served its purpose.Russia will control a city left in ruins, with residents forced to flee or face dire conditions.Dimitar Dilkoff / AFP via Getty Images fileCasualties and counteroffensivesRussian forces sought to surround and relentlessly shell Bakhmut after claiming control of the neighboring town of Soledar in January. As the Russians ramped up their assault, officials in Kyiv voiced increasing alarm for the troops clinging on in Bakhmut.NBC News visited the city in February and found a dire situation for the few thousand civilians who had stayed behind from an estimated prewar population of around 80,000. Known for its salt and gypsum mines, Bakhmut had become a ghost town, with residents sheltering in basements from the relentless thuds of artillery fire.But Zelenskyy defied the urging of some analysts and opted to reinforce his troops defending the city rather than withdraw, hoping to frustrate the Russians further and inflict more costly losses on the invaders.Those hopes appear to have been fulfilled, though Ukrainian troops undoubtedly suffered huge losses themselves.Ukraine opted to reinforce Bakhmut in recent months despite a dire situation that saw it control just a single road into the city.Dimitar Dilkoff / AFP - Getty ImagesAbout 20,000 of the Kremlin’s forces were killed in Ukraine between December and May alone, the United States estimated recently —  half of them Wagner fighters whose combat was focused in Bakhmut.Prigozhin, a longtime Putin associate and oligarch, has become a public face of Russia's war in recent months behind vocal criticism of Moscow's military leaders and the assault led by his band of ex-convicts.The mercenary leader has angrily denounced Russia’s regular army, accusing them of starving his men of ammunition and abandoning ground they had captured. On Saturday he said his Wagner forces would now pull out of Bakhmut in five days to rest, handing the city's ruins over to the military.Prigozhin had threatened to withdraw from the city after releasing a series of furious video messages aimed at Russia's military leaders.@concordgroup_official / AFP - Getty ImagesHis public feud with the Kremlin's top brass has escalated in recent weeks as his troops inside Bakhmut edged forward even as Russia's army was suddenly driven back on the city's flanks, in Ukraine's first significant gains for months.While Moscow's capture of the city belies the challenges it now faces, Kyiv has its eyes on prizes to come.Zelenskyy spent the weekend in Japan attending the Group of Seven summit of world leaders, the latest stop on a recent global tour that has seen him rally allied support and secure new military aid that could prove decisive in the battles ahead.Ukraine is preparing a sweeping counteroffensive that will aim to seize back land across the front lines of the war.Ukrainian soldiers fire a cannon near Bakhmut, where intense artillery battles have left the city and surrounding land scarred by months of war.Libkos / AP fileBakhmut lies in the northeastern part of Donetsk province, one half of the Donbas.

Bakhmut has been the site of some of the heaviest battles with the Russian troops, pictured here on Feb. 27, 2023. Yevhen Titov / APAsked if the city was under Russian control he said, “I think no, but you have to understand there is nothing. They destroyed our city. There are no buildings. It’s a pity, a tragedy but for today Bakhmut is only in our hearts. There is nothing of this place, just ground and a lot of dead Russians.”  He added that Ukrainian defenders “did strong work in the city.”Zelenskyy's spokesman, Sergii Nykyforov, later clarified on Facebook that his’ “no” was referring to Russia’s assertion that it had taken the city.Wagner mercenary chief Yevgeny Prigozhin, whose fighters led the costly Russian push for the city, claimed Saturday to have finally captured it. Russia’s Defense Ministry also said in a Telegram post that the city’s “liberation” had been completed.  A statement posted to the Russian president’s website on Sunday said Vladimir Putin had congratulated Wagner forces and the military “on the completion of the operation,” to liberate the city.Watch: Reporter braves Russian shelling to visit Bakhmut frontlineMay 19, 202303:57After a litany of setbacks, Moscow focused on seizing Bakhmut over the winter in the hopes of a much needed success that could also serve as a stepping stone to the rest of the surrounding industrial heartland known as the Donbas. Ukraine sought to wear down Russian forces by forcing a protracted fight that turned into the longest and bloodiest of the war, buying time for its military to prepare a crucial counteroffensive.In recent days Kyiv's troops have clawed back ground on the city’s flanks, exposing bitter divisions between the Kremlin’s military leaders, and leading an angry Prigozhin to say his troops inside the city were at risk of encirclement.The city's symbolic weight had grown with each day that Ukrainian defenders held out against waves of Russian attacks. That resistance became a point of national pride, with the phrase ""Bakhmut holds"" becoming a daily patriotic rallying cry. It holds no longer, but Kyiv may believe it has served its purpose.Russia will control a city left in ruins, with residents forced to flee or face dire conditions.Dimitar Dilkoff / AFP via Getty Images fileCasualties and counteroffensivesRussian forces sought to surround and relentlessly shell Bakhmut after claiming control of the neighboring town of Soledar in January. As the Russians ramped up their assault, officials in Kyiv voiced increasing alarm for the troops clinging on in Bakhmut.NBC News visited the city in February and found a dire situation for the few thousand civilians who had stayed behind from an estimated prewar population of around 80,000. Known for its salt and gypsum mines, Bakhmut had become a ghost town, with residents sheltering in basements from the relentless thuds of artillery fire.But Zelenskyy defied the urging of some analysts and opted to reinforce his troops defending the city rather than withdraw, hoping to frustrate the Russians further and inflict more costly losses on the invaders.Those hopes appear to have been fulfilled, though Ukrainian troops undoubtedly suffered huge losses themselves.Ukraine opted to reinforce Bakhmut in recent months despite a dire situation that saw it control just a single road into the city.Dimitar Dilkoff / AFP - Getty ImagesAbout 20,000 of the Kremlin’s forces were killed in Ukraine between December and May alone, the United States estimated recently —  half of them Wagner fighters whose combat was focused in Bakhmut.Prigozhin, a longtime Putin associate and oligarch, has become a public face of Russia's war in recent months behind vocal criticism of Moscow's military leaders and the assault led by his band of ex-convicts.The mercenary leader has angrily denounced Russia’s regular army, accusing them of starving his men of ammunition and abandoning ground they had captured. On Saturday he said his Wagner forces would now pull out of Bakhmut in five days to rest, handing the city's ruins over to the military.Prigozhin had threatened to withdraw from the city after releasing a series of furious video messages aimed at Russia's military leaders.@concordgroup_official / AFP - Getty ImagesHis public feud with the Kremlin's top brass has escalated in recent weeks as his troops inside Bakhmut edged forward even as Russia's army was suddenly driven back on the city's flanks, in Ukraine's first significant gains for months.While Moscow's capture of the city belies the challenges it now faces, Kyiv has its eyes on prizes to come.Zelenskyy spent the weekend in Japan attending the Group of Seven summit of world leaders, the latest stop on a recent global tour that has seen him rally allied support and secure new military aid that could prove decisive in the battles ahead.Ukraine is preparing a sweeping counteroffensive that will aim to seize back land across the front lines of the war.Ukrainian soldiers fire a cannon near Bakhmut, where intense artillery battles have left the city and surrounding land scarred by months of war.Libkos / AP fileBakhmut lies in the northeastern part of Donetsk province, one half of the Donbas.

But host Japan is increasingly stepping beyond the boundaries set by its history and playing a more assertive role on the world stage. It’s not the only one, as some experts say North Korea’s escalating nuclear threats and worries over China’s sweeping territorial claims that have been sharpened by Russia’s war in Ukraine are pushing Washington’s friends in the region to embrace a more aggressive approach to security — and embrace each other.Historically bitter enemies, Japan and South Korea are each host to tens of thousands of American troops and both are now seeking to build up their militaries and their cooperation. The Chinese government has condemned what it views as smaller countries in its backyard toadying up to their benefactor in Washington. By contrast, this development is music to the ears of the White House, which has long called for countries to join its geopolitical struggle against what it sees as Beijing’s nefarious rise.“The United States has pressured its Asian allies to turn the page on history and cooperate on containing China while dealing with the threat from Pyongyang,” Jeff Kingston, a professor of history and Asian studies at Temple University, Japan Campus, told NBC News.South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, left, and his wife, Kim Keon Hee, have dinner with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and his wife, Yuko Kishida, at the presidential residence in Seoul earlier in May.AFP - Getty ImagesThis all came ahead of the annual summit of G7 leaders, which runs Friday to Sunday. This is an informal club of rich democracies — the U.S., Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy and Japan — which meet each year to discuss global politics. This time it’s being hosted in Hiroshima, “a city which has recovered from the catastrophic damage by an atomic bomb and which continues to seek lasting world peace,” according to the summit’s website. This makes it “the most fitting location to express” the G7’s “commitment to peace.”Top of the agenda is Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, whose President Volodymyr Zelenskyy made an in-person appearance at the summit to rally support.On Friday, the group’s leaders made the direct connection between the city’s history and Russia’s nuclear threats, which have helped drive Japan’s push to make arms control  a major part of the gathering.“We reiterate our position that threats by Russia of nuclear weapon use, let alone any use of nuclear weapons by Russia, in the context of its aggression against Ukraine are inadmissible,” they said in a joint statement.But close behind that grinding conflict is how to approach China, with allies still somewhat divided on how to balance cooperation economically with confrontation on China’s alleged human rights abuses, authoritarianism and territorial expansionism.The Kremlin’s war has sharpened minds in Asia about what would happen if China invaded Taiwan, a self-governed island that Beijing sees as rightfully its territory. “Ukraine today may be East Asia tomorrow,” Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida told another summit in Singapore last June.Some experts believe that, although North Korea's nuclear arsenal is seen as the most pressing threat in Seoul, growing concern about China has emerged as another factor behind a rapprochement between Japan and South Korea that comes as both countries embrace a more hawkish approach to defense.From left: European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, President Biden, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz during the G7 Summit on Friday in Hiroshima, Japan.

The event follows two historic summits between Kishida and South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, with both leaders visiting each other’s capitals for talks over sake and beer.This was a big deal. These were their first formal meetings for more than a decade, beginning the process of resolving bitterness from Japan’s colonial occupation of South Korea from 1910-45. President Joe Biden called it a “groundbreaking new chapter” at the White House in March. Without mentioning China by name, he couched the strengthening partnership as one of “free and open” democracies against authoritarianism — a central theme of his administration.At at a trilateral meeting the G7 summit, Biden invited Yoon and Kishida for another meeting Washington, a senior U.S. official said. In a statement issued after the talks, the White House said the leaders had “discussed how to take their trilateral cooperation to new heights,” including with new coordination in the face of North Korea‘s “illicit nuclear and missile threats.”Japan announced late last year that its military spending will double to 2% of its gross domestic product — a historic departure from its supposedly “pacifist” constitution. It ruffled feathers in Beijing with its decision to deploy Patriot missile batteries on islands close to Taiwan. And it is even considering opening a NATO liaison office, Koji Tomita, Japan’s ambassador to the U.S., said last week, a small but symbolically significant gesture of Western solidarity.In South Korea, the feeling that North Korea's arsenal is becoming ever more of a threat means that more than 70% now favor developing nuclear weapons of their own, a poll last year by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs found.That prompted Washington to announce a new defense pact with the government in Seoul, which included the U.S. sending nuclear-capable submarines to the country — so long as it reaffirmed its promise not to try to get its hands on nuclear weapons of its own.South Korea is heavily reliant on China for trade, so it has historically been careful with how it treats its giant neighbor. But relations between the two have dipped as of late, particularly after South Korea’s president, Yoon, suggested China was attempting “to change the status quo by force” in Taiwan. This sparked a tit-for-tat summoning of ambassadors, with China’s Foreign Ministry calling the comments “erroneous” and “totally unacceptable.”Anti-war protesters gather Wednesday in Hiroshima ahead of the G7.Louise Delmotte / APSimon Chelton, a former British defense attache in Tokyo, said it would be wrong to chalk up the developments solely to concerns over China, North Korean missile tests or prompting by the U.S. — but rather a more complex mix of all three that has been brewing for years if not decades.“The reason that Japan is now increasing spending is not a knee-jerk reaction to what Biden is saying, it’s not a sudden whim,” said Chelton, who is now an associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, a think tank in London. “It is a gradual buildup that goes back many years. Everything in Japan is always gradual.”China sees these moves merely as an excuse for Japan and South Korea to toe America’s line on containing Beijing. Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told a briefing last week that the trio were using North Korea “as a pretext to strengthen military cooperation.” He blamed the U.S. allies for increasing the risk of “bloc confrontation in the region” and undermining “the already fragile mutual trust” between them and Beijing. The state-run news agency Xinhua wrote the same day that “the US has been trying to put together an anti-China coterie for a long time,” describing the alliance as “a plot.”Many experts agree that the strengthening trio is in part motivated by China — and with good reason.“China’s military modernization over the past two decades, involving annual double-digit increases in military spending, combined with greater assertiveness about China’s disputed territorial claims, generates unease about Beijing’s hegemonic ambitions,” Kingston, at Temple University, said.That unease has produced an unlikely bonhomie that not only subverts the bitter rivalry of yesterday but also could shape today’s geopolitical status quo — starting this weekend.Alexander SmithAlexander Smith is a senior reporter for NBC News Digital based in London.Brigitte Pu contributed ","{'neg': 0.092, 'neu': 0.847, 'pos': 0.061, 'compound': -0.9962}","10,423,43",China,"('35.000074', '104.999927')",35.000074,104.999927,"[('China', 15), ('Japan', 15), ('\xa0', 15), ('Korea', 13), ('South', 11)]"

""But I've been very clear to him from the very beginning, we have to spend less money than we spent last year.""McCarthy said both sides are ""still apart,"" but he and the president had decided during their call to get their negotiators back together.“Let them brief up the president, let him get some sleep. And he wanted to get together personally tomorrow, I agreed to that, we’d do that sometime in the afternoon,"" he said. ""Time is of the essence.”A White House official confirmed the upcoming Monday meeting between Biden and McCarthy and said that their staffs will also reconvene at 6 p.m. Sunday evening to discuss remaining issues.McCarthy praised White House negotiators for engaging in “very professional” discussions.“I have great respect for the individuals on the president’s team,” he said. “They’re bright, they’re articulate, they know exactly what they’re doing. We may philosophically disagree, but we have respect for one another, because we’re coming from a place of principles. And when you come from a place of principles, normally at the end of the day, you can find common ground and keep your principles at the same time.”‘Some bills have to go unpaid’ if debt limit isn’t raised, says Treasury Sec. YellenMay 21, 202302:01The call between Biden and McCarthy came shortly after Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said on NBC News' ""Meet the Press"" that early June is a “hard deadline” for the federal government to raise the debt ceiling and warned that bills will go unpaid if Congress fails to reach a deal before the U.S. runs out of money.“I indicated in my last letter to Congress that we expect to be unable to pay all of our bills in early June and possibly as soon as June 1. And I will continue to update Congress, but I certainly haven’t changed my assessment,” Yellen said. “So I think that that’s a hard deadline.”During a press conference in Japan on Sunday, the president urged Republicans to “move from their extreme positions,” which he criticized as “frankly unacceptable,” in his opening remarks.“It’s time for Republicans to accept that there is no bipartisan deal to be made solely solely on their partisan terms,” he said. “They have to move as well.”Republicans returned to the debt ceiling negotiating table Friday night after temporarily putting a hold on talks with the White House, which they said were “not productive.”Part of the hang-up in negotiations is that House Republicans want to force major spending cuts that are opposed by Biden and dead on arrival in the Democratic-controlled Senate. Democrats are reluctant to accept a spending limit that’s lower than current levels, a source familiar with the party’s stance told NBC News last week. The party may prefer to maintain existing levels, even if it means a new spending deal fails and the government runs on autopilot through a continuing resolution.Rep. Garret Graves, R-La., who was tapped by McCarthy to lead negotiations with the White House, told reporters Sunday that “a lot of progress” has been made in discussions on the debt ceiling.“If you go through the laundry list of about 50 items, we have made a lot of progress,” Graves said. “Understanding one another’s positions, understanding red lines. And so I think that we have really been able to come close, much closer than we were when we started.”Julie TsirkinJulie Tsirkin is a correspondent covering Capitol Hill.Kyle StewartKyle Stewart is an associate producer covering Congress for NBC News.Summer ConcepcionSummer Concepcion is a politics reporter for NBC News.Caroline Kenny contributed ","{'neg': 0.073, 'neu': 0.861, 'pos': 0.066, 'compound': -0.6917}","106,227,0",Japan,"('36.5748441', '139.2394179')",36.5748441,139.2394179,"[('said', 12), ('McCarthy', 11), ('House', 10), ('News', 9), ('Biden', 8)]"

Ron DeSantis’ “aggressive attempts to erase Black history and to restrict diversity, equity and inclusion programs"" in the state's schools, the organization said in a statement.“Florida is openly hostile toward African Americans, people of color and LGBTQ+ individuals,” the NAACP said. “Before traveling to Florida, please understand that the state of Florida devalues and marginalizes the contributions of, and the challenges faced by African Americans and other communities of color.”The advisory comes after DeSantis’ administration in January blocked an Advanced Placement course in African American Studies from being offered in Florida high schools. In a letter to the College Board rejecting the course, the administration said: “As presented, the content of this course is inexplicably contrary to Florida law and significantly lacks educational value.”Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in Rothschild, Wis., on May 6, 2023.Scott Olson / Getty Images fileNAACP President and CEO Derrick Johnson said in a statement that ""failing to teach an accurate representation of the horrors and inequalities that Black Americans have faced and continue to face is a disservice to students and a dereliction of duty to all.""Under DeSantis, ""the state of Florida has become hostile to Black Americans and in direct conflict with the democratic ideals that our union was founded upon,"" Johnson added.The College Board, a nonprofit organization that oversees the AP program nationwide, moved to revise its framework for the curriculum after state officials said they rejected it because of six areas of concern — “Black Queer Studies,” “Intersectionality,” “Movement for Black Lives,” “Black Feminist Literary Thought,” “The Reparations Movement” and “Black Struggle in the 21st Century” — and for its including works by Kimberlé W. Crenshaw, bell hooks, Angela Davis and other Black authors.Although the College Board and many of the academic experts consulted about the course framework insisted that they would not cave to political pressure and that the revisions had long been planned, the changes made concessions that directly address conservatives’ concerns. The revised syllabus removed the names of several Black authors identified as problematic by Florida officials, substantially revised sections about intersectionality and removed a section about the Movement for Black Lives.The NAACP’s travel advisory for Florida was initially proposed to the board of directors by the organization’s Florida State Conference, which voted unanimously in favor of it in March.DeSantis, who is expected to soon launch a 2024 presidential campaign, has made education and other social issues a large focus of his administration. Last year, he signed into law legislation dubbed the “Stop WOKE Act,” which restricts how race and gender are discussed in classrooms.DeSantis’ office and the NAACP did not immediately respond requests for comment on the travel advisory.The Missouri chapter of the NAACP had issued an advisory in 2017, urging Black people “to travel with extreme CAUTION” because “race, gender and color based crimes have a long history” in the state. The advisory came three years after the killing of Michael Brown, a Black teenager, by a white police officer sparked days of unrest in Ferguson.Summer ConcepcionSummer Concepcion is a politics reporter for NBC News ","{'neg': 0.069, 'neu': 0.903, 'pos': 0.028, 'compound': -0.9789}","10,423,43",Florida,"('27.7567667', '-81.4639835')",27.7567667,-81.4639835,"[('Black', 13), ('Florida', 10), ('advisory', 8), ('DeSantis', 7), ('NAACP', 6)]"

Gov. Roy Cooper had vetoed the legislation, but the state's Republican-led Assembly voted Tuesday to override that veto.Also on Tuesday, the South Carolina House of Representatives approved a six-week abortion ban, which now advances to the state Senate. And last month, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a bill that would ban most abortions after six weeks. The law will take effect if Florida's Supreme Court upholds its current 15-week ban in an ongoing legal challenge.""We’re going to see many people forced to continue pregnancies against their will,” said Amy Hagstrom Miller, the founder and CEO of Whole Woman’s Health, which operates two abortion clinics in Virginia, along with clinics in Indiana, Maryland, Minnesota and New Mexico.Miller said she was bracing for more women who are seeking abortions to travel to Virginia, which will likely soon be the last Southern state without abortion restrictions.North Carolina’s ban makes exceptions for rape, incest and “life-limiting” fetal anomalies. Proponents of the legislation argue that it offers a compromise on abortion.""The things in this bill are not obstacles to abortion. They’re safeguards. We seek to balance protecting unborn babies while ensuring the safe care of mothers,"" North Carolina House Speaker Pro Tem Sarah Stevens said in floor remarks Tuesday night.Even before North Carolina's 12-week ban passed, Miller said her Virginia clinics were seeing patients from across the South. Since January, her call center has received more than 6,000 phone calls from people out of state seeking care in Virginia, she said.Not all of those people make it to her clinics: Miller said that every day, a patient cancels an appointment, often after multiple attempts to reschedule, because of factors that prevent the patient from traveling, such as a child getting sick or a ride falling through.""They say to us, 'It’s just going be easier for me to have a baby. I can’t figure out how to get there,'"" she said.The time it takes to schedule an appointment and arrange travel also prompts some patients to delay abortions until the second trimester (on average, women don't learn they're pregnant until between five and six weeks' gestation). In many cases, that will entail a surgical abortion, since abortion pills are approved for use only up to 10 weeks of pregnancy.The forthcoming ban in North Carolina could exacerbate those issues, Miller said.Amber Gavin, the vice president of advocacy and operations at A Woman’s Choice, which operates three abortion clinics in North Carolina, said her clinics were already seeing wait times of about 10 days.Gavin said those waits may get longer once the 12-week ban takes effect — even if patient volume decreases — because the new law requires an in-person visit three days before an abortion and mandates that all abortions, even those done using pills, be administered in person.""It just adds more administrative tasks to our physicians and our medical staff than necessary,"" Gavin said.She added that her North Carolina clinics frequently see patients from Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina and Texas. Come July 1, the clinics will start referring women who are more than 12 weeks pregnant to providers in Virginia, Maryland, Illinois and Washington, D.C., she said.""It’s just going to have devastating effects to the entire South,"" Gavin said.One remaining option is The Brigid Alliance, a service that provides travel, food, lodging, child care and other logistical support for people seeking abortions across the U.S. Clinics and providers can refer people to the service, which receives funding from private donors. The group's typical client travels more than 1,300 miles round trip and has travel expenses of nearly $1,400.""A lot of our clients haven’t even left their county,"" said Serra Sippel, the alliance’s interim executive director. ""Many have never been on an airplane before.""In the long term, medical experts and political leaders also fear an exodus of physicians from states with abortion bans, which could limit access to both abortions and maternal health care more broadly in the South. ""The North Carolina ban will harm patients and threaten doctors for providing essential care,"" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement on Tuesday.Dr. Catherine Kuhn, associate dean for graduate medical education at Duke University School of Medicine, said residents who are training in obstetrics, gynecology or family medicine will likely need to travel to other states to learn how to administer abortions after 12 weeks. North Carolina might also struggle to attract new medical talent if the state is seen as hostile to reproductive health care, Kuhn added. A survey of medical students, published this week, found that nearly 60% said they were unlikely or very unlikely to apply to a single residency program in a state with abortion restrictions.""I'm worried that, particularly in women's health and reproductive health care, we'll see a decrease in applications and interest,"" Kuhn said.Aria BendixAria Bendix is the breaking health reporter for NBC News Digital ","{'neg': 0.09, 'neu': 0.836, 'pos': 0.074, 'compound': -0.9745}","10,423,43",North Carolina,"('35.6729639', '-79.0392919')",35.6729639,-79.0392919,"[('said', 18), ('Carolina', 15), ('abortion', 15), ('North', 12), ('clinics', 9)]"
