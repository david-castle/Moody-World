Timothy Martin, 53, and Joanna Smith, 53, both surrendered themselves to authorities Friday after they were indicted on charges of conspiracy to commit an offense against the United States and injury to a National Gallery of Art exhibit, the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Washington, D.C., said in a release. Martin and Smith, along with other unindicted co-conspirators with the climate group Declare Emergency, walked into the art museum with the intent of damaging the sculpture, the indictment alleges.

By         Chris Eberhart   |       Video Jeremy Corbell talks about potential UFO over a military base An unknown object with flashing lights appeared to hover over Marine base in Twentynine Palms, California, in 2021.A Stanford University pathology professor said, ""Aliens have been on Earth for a long time and are still here,"" and claims there are experts working on reverse engineering unknown crashed crafts.    Dr. Garry Nolan made the bold statements during last week's SALT iConnections conference in Manhattan during a session called, ""The Pentagon, Extraterrestrial Intelligence and Crashed UFOs.""The host, Alex Klokus, said that's tough to believe and asked him to assign a probability to that statement that extraterrestrial life visited Earth.   ""100 percent,"" Nolan responded.  ‘UFO’ SPOTTED LURKING ABOVE U.S.' LARGEST MARINE BASE: 'WE GOT ALIENS   Video""I think it's an advanced form of intelligence that using some kind of intermediaries,"" Nolan said. ""It's not that they walk among us wearing a skin suit. You're going to put something there that I think of as an intelligence test.""He said it’s like the South American native tribes when they first saw the Spanish ships. They didn’t know what they were seeing but it was out of the ordinary.   FOOTAGE OF UFOS OVER CONFLICT ZONES SEEN FOR FIRST TIME: ‘THIS IS DEVASTATING’They didn't know what they were seeing or who or what was coming, Nolan said.   ""They're showing up and saying who amongst you are intelligent enough to realize what it is you're looking at … ""Can you see what's in front of you for what it really is? Can you see the anomalous data point?""    WATCH GARRY NOLAN'S FULL TALKThe ""most compelling evidence,"" according to Nolan, is how the U.S. government has handled UAPs - unidentified anomalous phenomena, which is government-derived word that means UFO - over the last couple of years. That includes the creation of The All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) within in the Department of Defense, which is tasked with investigating potential UFO sightings, and public Senate hearings on UFO.     ‘RUNAWAY FIREBALL’ COULD BE ALIEN PROBE THAT CRASHED OFF COAST OF PAPUA NEW GUINEA: HARVARD SCIENTISTThe most recent hearing was held on April 19 in front of the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities, which Nolan said ""created a hornet's nest in Washington.""""Then my personal experiences with one individual who was involved in collecting the original information,"" Nolan said, ""and my experiences with people who have worked or working on reverse engineering programs of downed crafts.""    A potential UFO was seen flying over a U.S. Marine base in 2021. The photo was obtained by Jeremy Corbell, who shared it with Digital (@Jeremycorbell/WeaponizedPodcast.com)  UFO seen in clip released by Department of Defense. A Pentagon watchdog is launching a probe into the actions taken by the Department of Defense after a series of UFO sightings in recent years.   (Department of Defense)Nolan said that he knew people who were working on reverse engineering a downed craft.     Some of these unknown crafts have been captured on video performing maneuvers never seen before and seemingly defy the laws of physics. UFO SENATE HEARING: PENTAGON OFFICAL ‘CONCERNED ABOUT CHINA AND RUSSIA’S ‘ADVANCED TECH’  ""A tiny piece of knowledge from that could revolutionize what we're doing,"" Nolan said. ""I'm always looking for the opportunity. I'm looking at the upside of this.""I'm not worried about (aliens) coming and raiding us or taking our women and children. That's not my concern. My concern is how do we use it.""   Video  UAP reporting trends presented during April 19, 2023, senate hearing (U.S. Senate Committee on Armed Services)During the April 19 UFO Senate hearing, AARO Director Sean Kirkpatrick said there's no definitive evidence of extraterrestrial life.  ""Of the cases that are showing some sort of advanced technical signature … I am concerned about what that nexus is,"" Kirkpatrick said after he was asked about Russia and China's capabilities to attack and surveil U.S. interests.  ""I have indicators that some are related to foreign capabilities. We have to investigate that with our [intelligence community] partners.""    He didn't expound on what the ""indicators"" are. The AARO director said he's talking about a ""single percentage"" of all the cases analyzed, which he said is about 650 reports, and it's difficult to definitively determine the object's origin without seeing a country's flag on the side of the object.   Chris Eberhart is a crime and US news journalist for Digital.

Texas residents share how familiar they are with artificial intelligence on a scale from one to 10 and detailed how much they use it each day.NEWYou can now listen to articles!   The ""Godfather of A.I.,"" Geoffrey Hinton, quit Google out of fear that his former employer intends to deploy artificial intelligence in ways that will harm human beings. ""It is hard to see how you can prevent the bad actors from using it for bad things,"" Hinton recently told The New York Times.      But stomping out the door does nothing to atone for his own actions, and it certainly does nothing to protect conservatives – who are the primary target of A.I. programmers – from being canceled.  Here are five things to know as the battle over A.I. turns hot:    FAKE PENTAGON EXPLOSION IMAGE GOES VIRAL ON TWITTER, SPARKING FURTHER AI CONCERNS  1. Google’s new monopoly on ""Truth"" Elon Musk recently revealed that Google co-founder Larry Page and other Silicon Valley leaders want AI to establish a ""digital god"" that ""would understand everything in the world. … [A]nd give you back the exact ‘right’ thing instantly."" It is hard to imagine anything more dangerous to a pluralistic, democratic Republic than a single dispenser of ""truth.""      The Biden administration has seen the potential of AI to push its political message.  (JOSEP LAGO/AFP via Getty Images)That nobody has a monopoly on truth is the prerequisite for pluralism. But pluralism is what authoritarians abhor and what AI tech executives cannot tolerate. Conservatives have already seen how Big Tech censors and cancels us based on our beliefs and political viewpoints. AI is being turbocharged to do this in limitless ways.  2. Brainwashing is no longer science fiction Americans are just beginning to understand that the dangers of AI go far beyond economic disruption. They also go beyond silencing speech. The newest gadgets being powered by AI now permit tech companies to capture our most intimate thoughts and our most sensitive data. They have already begun to map our minds, so they can manipulate our thoughts.   Duke Law professor Nita Farahany (a biologist, philosopher and human rights attorney) has been sounding the alarm, explaining how the Chinese government is using AI to analyze facial expressions and brain waves to punish those who are not faithful communists.  Using similar technology, U.S. tech companies may be able to hack into the minds of users to steal PIN codes, according to Farahany. They are also tracking brain waves via sensors embedded in watches and headphones which can determine which political messages are most persuasive to a user.     VideoAI will soon empower lying politicians to deceive more voters than ever before. When Farahany tried to explain these dangers at the World Economic Forum, the snobs of Davos applauded enthusiastically. They see AI’s dangers as an asset.      3. The GOP is truly the Grand OLD Party Republicans in Congress who are even talking about AI are focusing on how many nurses and truck drivers might lose their jobs, not about the serious threat AI poses to the very essence of who we are as humans. Economic disruption is most assuredly going to happen, but Republicans are missing the profound implications to liberty.   In the first AI hearing held by the House Innovation Subcommittee this year, Big Tech lobbyists admitted that self-driving car manufacturers would gobble up every imaginable bit of data ""for our own safety"" but assured the committee that they would endeavor not to share this data with other companies. Shockingly, nobody asked the obvious: what assurances do we have that these companies will not use this data against their own customers?  You’d think that the lessons of Big Tech censorship would draw every Republican into the AI fight. That has not happened yet.      Americans are just beginning to understand that the dangers of AI go far beyond economic disruption. They also go beyond silencing speech.  4. Democrats have us where they want us Democrats in the Biden administration and in Congress have a much better understanding that AI is the greatest tool they’ve ever had to socialize America. Many are pretending to call for a pause to AI development while stomping on the accelerator to develop it as fast as possible.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTERHere's reality: the Biden administration has already pledged to spend $140 million to establish seven AI research institutes, and it just created the National Artificial Intelligence Advisory Committee to chart ""a path for responsible and inclusive AI."" Even more telling, the Biden White House has indicated to it will direct federal agencies to ""use AI tools"" in their work. Nary a pause in the Dems' use of AI can be found.   5. But failure is not an option Communist China just released regulations mandating that AI be programmed to reflect ""socialist core values"" and avoid information that could undermine ""state power.""      CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThe Chinese government and other authoritarians seek to harness this new technological power for control of information and the masses. They will use it extensively in warfare, too.    The trick is to lead the development of AI globally while enforcing appropriate guardrails to prevent the left from attacking our freedoms. The window to achieve both is small and shrinking.    Dan Schneider is vice president of MRC Free Speech America                      Get the recap of top opinion commentary and original content throughout the week.

""It's time to pay."" Those four words from Missouri Democrat Rep. Cori Bush are being heard a lot by Democratic politicians across the country this month. For Bush, the debt amounts to $14 trillion in reparations for Black Americans.     In California, activists are demanding as much as $5 million per Black resident and asking Gov. Gavin Newsom ""where's the money?"" One member of Newsom's Reparations Task Force demanded that the state pay its ""sin bill"" In New York and Chicago, mayors are balking at towering costs from migrants being shipped from the border to their ""sanctuary"" cities.   CA REPARATIONS TASK FORCE MEMBER DEFENDS MILLION-DOLLAR PAYOUTS: 'SIN BILL' FOR 'TERRORIZING BLACK PEOPLE'  In Tampa, after demanding $3 million per Black resident, a witness said that he and others were putting ""White people on notice that we want our reparations."" Bills are coming due after years of political campaigning on these issues.     Rev. Tony Pierce calls for millions of dollars in reparations for each Black Californian at a meeting of the California Reparations Task Force on May 6, 2023. (YouTube screenshot from California Department of Justice channel)Reparations and sanctuary cities have long been the bread and butter of identity politics. For years, Democratic politicians have campaigned on these ""moral imperatives"" in passing sanctuary laws and setting up reparation task forces.   It is the equivalent of a compounding interest on credit card debt. Each election Democrats used these issues for short-term political gains. Now those bills are coming due and Democratic leaders are balking.   President Joe Biden and Congress are in a potentially lethal game of chicken over the looming default over our debt. It would not seem an ideal time to demand an additional $14 trillion, but Bush declared, ""Black people in our country cannot wait any longer."" She was joined by members like Reps. Barbara Lee, D-Calif., Jamaal Bowman, D-N.Y., and Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich.It is a view being voiced across the country by Black citizens who were told that these payments are an undeniable moral obligation. The years of politicking on the issue have created a sense of entitlement to large cash payments. As one well-known California activist declared: ""It’s a debt that’s owed, we worked for free. We’re not asking; we’re telling you.""    VideoNewsom recently balked at the payment of the reparations recommended by his own task force, though he has indicated that some cash payments may still be made. Newsom attempted the long-expected pivot and said, rather plaintively, that dealing with the legacy of slavery ""is about much more than cash payments."" It may be too late for that spin. Recent polling shows 77% of Black Americans now support reparations – a stark increase in recent years.     Task Force member Rev. Amos Brown said they will not accept any excuses and that the state has to commit to the full amount and, if needed, ""pay for it over installments."" The late New York Gov. Mario Cuomo famously said that politicians campaign in poetry, but they govern in prose. However, the ""prose"" of many Democratic leaders is not winning any prizes. While many have denounced the bussing of migrants to sanctuary cities, most privately admit that there is an element of poetic justice. For years, these cities have told undocumented migrants that they are welcome to come to their cities where they would be protected. Then they showed up. It was a political version of ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner,"" the movie about a liberal couple who is confronted with a visit of their daughter and her Black fiance.       Walter Foster, 80, holds up a sign as the Reparations Task Force meets to hear public input at the California Science Center in Los Angeles on Sept. 22, 2022. (Carolyn Cole/Los Angeles Times via Getty Images)The single most riveting moment came at Martha's Vineyard where residents came out to clap and wave to the migrants... as they were shipped to a military base off the island. New York City has been shipping migrants to other cities, which are going to court to stop the relocation. Many of these towns point out that, unlike New York City, they have never declared themselves a sanctuary for undocumented persons. Even though these cities have been sent a fraction of the influx of states like Texas, mayors in sanctuary cities like Chicago have expressed outrage. As with those expecting reparations, these migrants are understandably confused. They were told that Chicago was a ""ciudad santuario."" Chicago reaffirmed this status in 2022 when it extended protections and benefits.    At the time, politicians scrambled for cameras to declare, as did Alderwoman Rossana Rodríguez, that Chicago must be ""a welcoming city for immigrants"" and reaffirmed that ""our city is responsible for acting with solidarity towards the people that are the most marginalized and the most impacted by a system that oppresses them.""     Task Force member Rev. Amos Brown said that they will not except any excuses and that the state has to commit to the full amount and, if needed, ""pay for it over installments.""  Then they showed up in greater numbers and the former Mayor Lori Lightfoot demanded that the migrants be sent elsewhere or kept in border towns overwhelmed by far greater numbers of migrants. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER  In some cases, there is no alternative but to try to quietly abandon prior campaigns that generated acclaim nationally and caused serious damage locally. For example, some of us criticized cities like San Francisco for declaring a boycott of states which did not adhere to their views on issues like transgender rights.  I noted at the time that the boycott would cost the city dearly in cutting off 22 states by driving up costs. It did, and the city quietly rescinded the boycott after losing millions. While the media paid far less attention to the rescission than the original decision, other reversals have come at a greater political cost to the left.   For example, cities that led efforts to defund the police are now refunding the police after soaring crime rates and high levels of police retirements and resignations. Activists in cities like Los Angeles called it a ""slap in the face"" given years of promises from Democratic politicians.   CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPIn the meantime, Newsom's task force has demanded an assortment of other changes, including eliminating cash bail, abandoning the prosecution of certain crimes, subsidizing home purchases for Black residents, guaranteeing a ""right to return"" by taking over development projects to guarantee Black housing ownership. Some of those reforms can be finessed by politicians, but there is no spin that will obscure the absence of a cash payment.   These are the creditors of the Democratic Party, and they seem now intent on collecting on compounded interest of years of identity politics.     A version of this blog previously appeared on Jonathan Turley's blog. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE JONATHAN TURLEY   Jonathan Turley is the Shapiro professor of public interest law at George Washington University and a practicing criminal defense attorney.

Tim Scott, R-S.C., discusses 2024 presidential run and how he plans on winning the nomination.NEWYou can now listen to articles!   It's common among the conservative Twitterati to joke that the leftist media really want former President Donald Trump to be the nominee again, assuming -- as they did in 2016 -- that it means doom for the Republicans.    But whoever prevails, the 2024 Republican primary cycle is going to work out like all modern-day cycles. Inevitably, liberal Democrat reporters are going to end up loading buckets of slime and unloading them on every half-plausible candidate on the Republican side of the campaign. Even John McCain learned the hard way that his media pals would turn on him when it counted. VideoOn Monday, May 22, Sen. Tim Scott announced he was running for president, the only Black Republican in the Senate. The Left desperately wants to cartoon the Republican electorate as a pack of white supremacists, so Scott has to be mocked as the worst kind of African American.  REPUBLICAN SEN. TIM SCOTT FILES TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT IN 2024  MSNBC host Rachel Maddow, now the laziest host in cable news -- she only works Mondays -- mocked Scott's vocal delivery. ""That was a rough first three seconds of his presidential campaign,"" said Maddow, laughing. ""But who knows? Maybe it was just a rough first couple of seconds. Maybe in the end, he will do great. It worked out great for Peter Brady, in the end. He got through it. It was tough.""  So far, the GOP presidential field already contains two Black men and two Indian Americans, but Republicans are still hopelessly racist, because any Republican ‘of color’ is cartooned as a self-loathing Clarence Thomas, a token desperate for White approval. Maddow compared a 57-year-old Black man to a teenage white boy going through puberty. It's not hard to guess how this would have been greeted if someone mocked the Almighty Barack this way. It would be racist.PROLIFIC FUNDRAISER TIM SCOTT HAULS IN $2 MILLION IN FIRST 24 HOURS OF HIS 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN  Then there are the pompous pundettes on ABC's ""The View,"" lecturing Scott that he can't possibly run for president based on optimism about America's racial situation. Sunny Hostin waved him off: ""I don't know who his message is supposed to resonate with, actually. He's talking about victimhood and personal responsibility as if people aren't taking responsibility for their own actions."" Whoopi Goldberg echoed, ""He came out and did that dog whistle: victimhood."" VideoHostin said being a successful Black man is rare: ""He is the exception, and not the rule. And until he is the rule, then he can stop talking about systemic racism."" You can either agree America's a systemic racist cesspool, or you can shut up. Goldberg dropped the bomb: ""He's got Clarence Thomas Syndrome.""  CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER    Who is really demeaning Black Americans in this debate? Apparently, racial pessimism is forever.Journalists will also make routine fun of Scott's Christianity. Washington Post political reporter Ben Terris tweeted on Announcement Day, ""Tim Scott will be the first prez candidate I've ever asked about the status of his virginity."" A few years ago, lifelong bachelor Scott coyly answered Terris that the ship had sailed, but he insisted adultery was a sin. Why ask? Because Scott used to preach abstinence before marriage, which apparently opens the door to invasive personal questions. So, if Kamala Harris is pro-choice, has Terris asked her how many abortions she's had? Or how many she's funded, since she's so pro-abortion?

Jack Keane warns senior strategic analyst Jack Keane, a retired general, explains how the outcome of Turkey's presidential election could impact the U.S. and the importance of keeping Turkey as a NATO member.JERUSALEM — The first-ever presidential runoff election in Turkey will be decided Sunday, and two competing visions for the important NATO-member country will affect relations between Ankara and Washington.    The current strongman, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, known for his brand of populist political Islam, squares off against his social democratic Republic People’s Party challenger, Kemal Kilicdaroglu.Kilicdaroglu hails from the largely secular party of the founder of the Republic of Turkey, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, and is a bespectacled soft-spoken former civil servant.  Turks will celebrate the 100th year of the founding of modern Turkey this year and the famous slogan of Ataturk, ""Peace at Home, Peace in the World,"" remains an elusive goal for the Muslim-majority nation that straddles Europe and the Middle East.

(AP Photo/Francisco Seco)TURKEY ELECTION: PRESIDENT ERDOGAN, CHALLENGER ARE HEADED TO MAY 28 RUNOFF  Massive inflation has gripped the economy, and Turks are still recovering from a devastating earthquake that killed over 50,000 people in early 2023. The opposition accused Erodgan’s government of inertia and incompetence in response to earthquake rescue efforts. Critics argue Kilicdaroglu has injected xenophobia into the charged election, declaring he will deport the more than 3 million Syrian refugees to their war-ravaged country.   ""I am announcing here that I will send all refugees back home once I am elected president, period,"" Kilicdaroglu recently said.Turkey’s foreign policy is mired in an occupation of northern Syria and repeated attacks against Kurdish forces who fought with the U.S. to oust the Islamic State. The U.S. Congress has blocked sales of F-16 fighter jets to Turkey until Erdogan ratifies NATO membership for Sweden and Finland. Turkey recently green-lighted Finland’s entry, but Sweden’s admission is in limbo.   The U.S.-led North American Treaty Organization is a critical military alliance in the effort to stop Vladimir Putin’s jingoism in Europe, advocates of NATO argue.    Turkey wants Sweden to crack down on Kurdish opposition groups and dissidents in the northern European country who it says are part of the Turkey-designated terrorist organization, the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK).

The military F-16 deal amounts to $20 billion.Pro-Erdogan Turkish media outlets added their own interpretation to Kirby's comments claiming he said ""The president's position has not changed. We still would like to move forward on that. My recommendation would be to maybe talk to Sen. (Bob) Menendez’s office or folks on the (Capitol) Hill to talk about what their expectations are.""

And if Erdogan wins — and it looks like he might because he is leading in the polls and also has incumbency advantages, including near complete control of media that allows to him write any kind of narrative that he likes. ""The Associate Press reported that Erdogan’s message and power are amplified by his tight control over the media. The state-owned broadcaster TRT Haber devoted more than 48 hours of airtime to Erdogan since April 1, compared to 32 minutes given to Kilicdaroglu, according to Ilhan Tasci, a member of Turkey’s radio and television watchdog.

Researchers caught the attack on camera — saying it was an unusual attack, as the gray whales were large adults.Orcas have reportedly attacked and sunk three boats off the coast of Spain in apparent acts of revenge that experts worry other whales in their pod might copy.    ""The little ones shook the rudder at the back while the big one repeatedly backed up and rammed the ship with full force from the side,"" Werner Schafelberger told German publication Yacht. ""The two little orcas observed the bigger one's technique and, with a slight run-up, they too slammed into the boat.""Hundreds of incidents between orcas and boats off the Iberian coast have occurred since May 2020, with all but a handful resulting in only minor injuries or damage. However, the attacks have grown more frequent and a few have led to the boats sinking – the latest such attack happening just this month.   Marine biologist Alfredo Lopez Fernandez told Live Science that the lead whale, a female orca scientists have called White Gladis, suffered a ""critical moment of agony,"" likely a collision with a boat or entanglement with a fishing line, that turned her more aggressive.   FLORIDA MAN'S ARM AMPUTATED AFTER 10-FOOT ALLIGATOR ATTACKS OUTSIDE BAR NEAR POND    Orca killer whale, Galapagos, Isabela Island, Ecuador.

He said that four orcas from the same subpopulation have died since May 2020.     The behavior may have spread even beyond that population, with a British couple recently sharing their own experience of an orca attack near the coast of Morocco. Janet Morris and Stephen Bidwell of Cambridge, in eastern England, were enjoying a sailing course off the coast of Morocco recently when they spotted a pod of orcas, they said.GREAT WHITE SHARK SPOTTED FEASTING ON SEAL CARCASS NEAR CAPE COD      An Orca encroaches upon the sailing boat during the hour-long attack.

Morris said that he was worried they were ""sitting ducks."" ""We were amazingly calm but underneath we were thinking, ‘Oh my God,’"" Morris told British news service SWNS.  Scientists have documented orcas exhibiting violent behaviors and appearing to teach them to others, according to Marine Mammal Science: One incident saw a group of orcas attack, kill and eat blue whales.     Digital’s Maureen Mackey contributed to this report.   Peter Aitken is a Digital reporter with a focus on national and global news.                      Get all the stories you need-to-know from the most powerful name in news delivered first thing every morning to your inbox Arrives Weekdays  Subscribe  Subscribed       Subscribe  You've successfully subscribed to this newsletter!

In recent statements on Twitter, Cleese claimed that a reporter had ""misreported me"" when claiming the entertainer was planning to cut the famous ""Loretta"" scene for an upcoming stage adaptation of the classic religious satire film.He corrected the reports, claiming that he was merely illustrating what others had advised him to do with the potentially controversial scene.

Flabbergasted, Cleese’s character in the film tells the man that the notion is ridiculous, while another male colleague offers that they all merely advocate for his right to childbearing as a symbolic way of standing up to ""oppression.""  ""I want to be a woman… It’s my right as a man,"" the character claims in a scene obviously played for laughs. He adds, ""I want to have babies… It’s every man’s right to have babies if he wants them.""

The British outlet cited Cleese’s comments he gave at a recent show noting the controversy of the scene. Describing a recent read-through of ""Life of Brian"" with several actors, he said, ""At the end, I said to the American actors: 'What do you think?' And they said: 'We love the script, but you can't do that stuff about Loretta nowadays.'""He added, ""So here you have something there's never been a complaint about in 40 years, that I've heard of, and now all of a sudden we can't do it because it'll offend people.

I told them I was adapting the Life of Brian so that we could do it as a stage show (NOT a musical ). I said that we'd had a table-reading of the latest draft in NYC a year ago and that all the actors - several of them Tony winners - had advised me strongly to cut the Loretta scene.  I have, of course, no intention of doing so.""He then called out the media for leaving out the context surrounding his claims, saying, ""‘So someone in the audience had called a journalist and misreported me.

VideoCo-host Will Cain noted an ""ugly trend"" in sports media where people will intentionally dig through athletes' old tweets or their social media posts from when they were a child in attempts to socially punish them for their mistakes.   ""I don't understand the need for a society to punish children for mistakes, doing things that are wrong when they are children. That's a family's job to do,"" co-host Will Cain began.     ""As a society, we need to understand the value of grace. Because none of us walk through this world perfect. None of us walk through this world mistake-free. And if we're going to project our virtue by standing on the mistakes of children, well, we're never going to be done."" VideoJones concluded, ruling Cornell medical school's anti-racism course as ""null and void."" ""And it matters more to me who you are today. And you show that by your actions, not by an apology or a stupid – or even terrible in that case –  post from 20 years ago. That doesn't tell me who you are today. Your actions tell me who you are today, which kind of renders this course null and void, in my opinion,"" he argued.     In a statement to The College Fix, Cornell Professor Dr. Monika Safford told that outlet: ""We hope to see that people will form discussion groups during or after they complete the training to process the material and think more deeply about how as individuals, or as a group, they can apply allyship strategies in their personal or professional contexts.""  Kayla Bailey is Digital Production Assistant with .

""Who cares if I don’t fit into the jeans, and they have to send me home?

She said the magazine encourages its models to show up for their photo shoots exactly as they are.  The original swimsuit issue ran in 1964. It has been a launching pad for models such as Upton, as well as Kathy Ireland, Christie Brinkley, Elle Macpherson and Ashley Graham.Over the years, the issue has featured models in painted bikinis, plus-sized models, unedited photos, tiny swimsuits, amputee models, older models and the addition of professional athletes and celebrities in relationships.

""Growing up, I saw these women, and they were so stunning and amazing, but I felt like I didn’t look exactly like the women I was seeing in the media. And so, I want to show up like I show up in the real world. I don’t want to show up looking like some special version of myself that only appears once a year. I do live an active lifestyle.

He said the paparazzi are 'so intrusive' but noted that 'we're only getting a part of the story.'Princess Diana's former bodyguard Lee Sansum shared his thoughts on Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's alleged ""near catastrophic"" car chase in New York City.    The ex-Royal Military Police officer provided security for the late Princess of Wales and her sons Prince William and Prince Harry during the summer of 1997, prior to Diana's fatal collision that August.In an interview with Digital, Sansum weighed in on the May 16 incident, during which the Duke and Duchess of Sussex claimed paparazzi relentlessly pursued them and Meghan's mother Doria Ragland for over two hours through the streets of Manhattan.  ""I think really from the information that we're reading — that is put out by the press and whoever — I think we're only getting a part of the story,"" he said.    Princess Diana's former bodyguard Lee Sansum, left, weighed in on Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's alleged car chase in New York City. (Getty)Sansum continued, ""Whether it's entirely the correct story, it's a version of the story. But from my experience in the past, the paparazzi, the people taking the photographs… they are so intrusive. And eventually it just breaks you down.  PRINCE HARRY, MEGHAN MARKLE WERE WISE TO SKIP LATEST AWARDS GALA: PRINCESS DIANA'S FORMER BODYGUARD""Initially, you can just can get on with it and you can kind of put up with it. But it's very oppressive. And eventually, even the coolest of us, you're just, ‘Enough, man.’""  The security professional noted that paparazzi pursuits to get the ""money shot"" can not only jeopardize the safety of the photographer's subjects, but also that of bystanders.""I find it absolutely crazy that these people are allowed to do this and put the public at risk, chasing people,"" Sansum said. ""We say ‘chasing,’ we assume that they're going really fast. They don't have to be going fast, but they're cutting people off… They're advancing through traffic in an aggressive manner to catch a vehicle, to take a photograph that is going to make them money. And it's putting people at risk.""    The Duke and Duchess of Sussex claimed they were pursued by aggressive paparazzi for over two hours after leaving an event in Manhattan on May 16, 2023. (Getty Images)Sansum went on to cite Diana's accident as a ""classic example"" of a paparazzi chase that ended in tragedy. The princess, her partner Dodi Fayed and their chauffeur Henri Paul were killed on Aug. 31, 1997, when their vehicle crashed in the Pont de l'Alma tunnel in Paris as they were fleeing from photographers.     The car's fourth passenger, bodyguard Trevor Rees-Jones, was severely injured but survived the accident. At the time, Rees-Jones and Sansum were employed by Fayed's father Mohamed Al-Fayed as part of their family's protection team. PRINCE HARRY, MEGHAN MARKLE IN NYC: TIMELINE OF ALLEGED ‘NEAR-CATASTROPHIC’ INCIDENTIn his 2022 memoir ""Protecting Diana: A Bodyguard’s Story,"" Sansum recalled how he became part of the security detail tasked with guarding Diana and her sons during their vacation in Saint-Tropez, France. The royals stayed with Fayed, an Egyptian film producer, on Mohamed's luxury yacht the Jonikal in July 1997.    Sansum remembered that he befriended Diana and became one of her confidantes. He told Digital that the then-36-year-old shared her fears regarding the paparazzi's aggressive behavior.He said, ""This is what Princess Diana told me. She was trying to get the government in the U.K. to pass a bill and she failed. To stop them pursuing people. It's relentless and it just grinds people down. And I just sympathize with anybody that has these people chasing them.""  Sansum served as a bodyguard for Princess Diana and her sons Harry and William during their vacation in St. Tropez in July 1997. (Michel Dufour/WireImage)In his memoir, Sansum wrote that paparazzi swarmed the Jonikal daily in an effort to snap photos of Diana and Fayed. However, he explained that William and Harry, who were 15 and 12 at the time, appeared mostly unaffected by the media attention due to their young ages.   ""At that time, they were young boys,"" Sansum said. ""When kids are so young, they don't kind of grasp what's going on.""    He continued, ""I think they were so kind of focused on enjoying the hospitality of the Al-Fayed family and all the toys that they had and the boats, the jet skis and all the rest of it. I think they were more focused on that.""""We were trying to circumnavigate the paparazzi to get them some respite and some peace, so they could enjoy the holiday,"" Sansum added. ""They were kind of shielded from what was going on. So I think at that age, they were aware of it, but it didn't kind of get to them as it would an adult. But I do know they disliked the paparazzi.""    Diana and her children stayed on a luxury yacht that belonged to the father of her partner Dodi Fayed. (Michel Dufour/WireImage)Sansum said that he took issue with the term ""paparazzi,"" which he noted was more of a European descriptor at the time.""We all call them the 'paparazzi’ now,"" he said. ""But originally it was a European kind of thing. And the paparazzi now… this is how I personally feel. It's kind of dehumanizing these people. And we give them a name and everybody goes, ‘Oh, it’s the paparazzi.'""  FRENCH MEDIC RECALLS THE PEOPLE'S PRINCESS LAST MOMENTS ON 'TRAGIC NIGHT'  Sansum continued, ""But, for example, in the USA or wherever, these people are — they're neighbors. They live in our communities. They're earning money. You know, they're taking photographs of people. They're not ‘the paparazzi.’ They are our people, they live in our communities. And I think, you know, we kind of call them ‘the paparazzi’ and we kind of distance ourselves from them. But they live next door to the people. They are probably listening to this. They are normal people.""In a 2022 interview with The Sun, Sansum revealed that he could have been on duty on the night of the fatal car crash. He recalled that the security team drew straws to determine who would accompany Rees-Jones in the vehicle. Sansum went on to tell the outlet that Diana and Fayed might not have died in the accident if he had been in the car with them as he always insisted that they wear seatbelts.    Diana, Fayed and their chauffeur Henri Paul were killed in a car crash in Paris in the early hours of Aug. 31, 1997. (JOHN D MCHUGH/AFP via Getty Images)Sansum elaborated on his remarks during his interview with Digital. ""I was merely trying to say that if I was on duty that night, it would have changed the whole dynamics of the whole thing,"" he explained.    ""That's the only thing I meant by that,"" Sansum added. ""But also I was extremely strict on all my clients putting their seatbelts on. Always. I've been all over the world. I've been in war zones. I've been in Libya during the second war, working with the Americans up in Somalia when we were getting shot at and all sorts. And every single time before we set off, I tell my people to put their seatbelts on. I've lost a few friends in road traffic accidents all over the world. And, you know, I can say this, that with a hand on my heart, they would have been wearing their seatbelts.""Sansum reflected on how he would have handled last week's incident involving Harry and Meghan if he had been part of their security team. Sansum explained the importance of having a plan in place ahead of time, as well as anticipating that high-profile clients such as Harry and Meghan would likely be followed by paparazzi after attending an event.  ""But sometimes when you have the people that you're looking after, that you're bodyguarding, who are getting stressed and they really lost the plot… Sometimes it can affect the security team,"" he said. ""Those anxious feelings, those feelings of safety and ‘I just want to be on my own with my wife,' it can spill over into anxiety, into anger, and sometimes it can light the security team up.""   VideoSansum continued, ""When I speak to my teams that I've had in the past and we've been out in all sorts of places even including war zones, before we go on a mission, you'd say, 'Look, it's highly likely that this is going to happen.' And you go through the scenarios. You say, ‘Right, this happens.’ We've got to keep our cool. We've got to keep our heads. We've got to remember that the mission is to get these people from A to B safely.""And if the paparazzi in this instance are following and taking pictures, well, we knew it was possible that was going to happen. We've just got to stick to our mission. Kind of forget what's going on in the back of the car, keep a cool head and just get in there safely. And it's difficult when you've got people in your vehicle who would possibly behave in a way that affects the driver. It affects the team. And it can get very personal for somebody working in close protection, executive force protection. This is the number one rule. You cannot take it personally. You've just got to stick to your mission, stick to your drills and do what you know you need to do.""    Sansum told Digital he also believes communication with the clients is key and he always makes them aware of the plan. ""If it was me, I'd be saying to Harry and Meghan, 'This is where we're going. This is what's going to happen. This is likely to happen. We're likely to get paparazzi following us. And this is the plan. We're going to drive at a normal speed through the city. They will be trying to get close to us. They will be taking photographs. This will happen. Are you okay with that?,'"" he explained.""And you always get their permission to be calm and collected about this,"" he added. ""And once they understand, when it does start to happen, you can say, 'Excuse me. Do you remember the security safety brief before we started? We're going to stick to the plan. Is that okay? Pretty soon they're going to get bored and they're going to leave us alone.' And just reassure them.""    Meghan's mother, Doria Ragland, was with the couple during the alleged car chase. (Kevin Mazur)Following the incident, a spokesperson for Prince Harry and Markle told Digital: ""Last night, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex and Ms. Ragland were involved in a near catastrophic car chase at the hands of a ring of highly aggressive paparazzi.  ""This relentless pursuit, lasting over two hours, resulted in multiple near collisions involving other drivers on the road, pedestrians and two NYPD officers. While being a public figure comes with a level of interest from the public, it should never come at the cost of anyone’s safety.""PRINCE HARRY REQUESTS TO FUND OWN POLICE SECURITY IN THE UNITED KINGDOMAccording to royal watcher Omid Scobie, the paparazzi were confronted by police multiple times as they chased the royal couple, who were on their way to a private residence where they were staying. Scobie alleged on Twitter that the photographers had driven on a sidewalk, run through red lights, reversed down a one-way street, photographed the couple while driving and illegally blocked a moving vehicle.    Prince Harry, Meghan and her mother are ""understandably shaken but thankful everyone's safe,"" a source told Scobie.    Harry and Meghan lost their U.K. taxpayer-covered police protection when they stepped down as senior royals in 2020. (DANIEL LEAL/AFP)New York City Mayor Eric Adams criticized the ""reckless and irresponsible"" incident during a press conference, but also said he found it ""hard to believe"" a ""two-hour, high-speed chase"" happened in the densely populated city wrought with traffic, pedestrians and ongoing construction projects.And Julian Phillips, NYPD deputy commissioner of public information, said, ""The Duke and Duchess of Sussex arrived at their destination and there were no reported collisions, summonses, injuries, or arrests in regard.""  Earlier this week, Prince Harry lost a legal challenge seeking the ability to make private payments to police for protection while in the U.K. Lawyers for the government opposed allowing wealthy people to ""buy"" their own security from the police, according to the BBC.  In September 2021, Prince Harry originally applied for a judicial review of a Home Office decision that kept him from personally paying for police protection while he and his family were in the U.K. Harry and Meghan's tax-payer funded police protection was revoked when they stepped down from their roles as senior royals in 2020.Sansum told Digital that he was ""not surprised"" that Harry's legal challenge was rejected.

He's obviously coming back to U.K. He's got concerns about his personal security. And he probably knows having the police looking after him, he'll get the best security possible because of the top cover that they have. So he's obviously got issues about certain things.  ""I wasn't surprised at all that it was refused. Not at all. But there are companies and there are people here in the U.K. that could give him an extremely high level of security.

Nicks is a titan in the world of rock n' roll, at one point being named the ""Reigning Queen of Rock and Roll"" by Rolling Stone, as well as making the list of 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time and 100 Greatest Singers of All Time, for both her solo career and for her time with Fleetwood Mac. While it is clear Nicks was always destined for stardom, a chance encounter with Lindsey Buckingham during her senior year in high school led to the two of them getting discovered by Mick Fleetwood and them joining the legendary band, Fleetwood Mac.   Take a look back at Nicks' road to becoming the ""Queen of Rock and Roll.""    Stevie Nicks joined Fleetwood Mac in 1975.

(Getty Images)Soon after meeting Buckingham at a church social night where the two played guitar together, they started dating and decided to stay together in the Bay Area to pursue a music career.While Nicks had a contract to record a country album, Buckingham managed to get her out of it, persuading her to join his band, Fritz Rabyne Memorial Band after the original lead singer left the band. They went on to open up for Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin and Santana to name a few.  After four years together, the band broke up, leading Nicks and Buckingham to start their duo, Buckingham Nicks. The two were broke, but after receiving a rather large inheritance check, they were able to record a demo album.  Stevie Nicks worked as a host at a restaurant and as a maid for music producer Keith Olsen to support herself and Buckingham as they tried to get a record deal. (Photo by Gie Knaeps/Getty Images)""We did seven songs, and it took us a year,"" Nicks said according to a press kit released ahead of ""The Wild Heart."" ""They were really good, and when they were finished, we got in Lindsey’s car and drove to L.A., where every record company in the world passed on us. We were devastated, but we still knew we were good.""  In order to support herself and Buckingham, Nicks took all sorts of jobs, working as a waitress and as a cleaning lady for producer Keith Olsen. It was during this transitional period when Nicks wrote many of the songs which would go on to be Fleetwood Mac's biggest hits, including ""Rhiannon"" and ""Landslide.""    Nicks' determination to work hard to make her dreams come true stemmed from lessons she learned from her mom.""She said to me: ‘you will never stand in a room full of men and feel like you can’t keep up with them. And you will never depend upon a man to support you,’"" she told The Guardian in October 2020. ""She drummed that into me, and I’m so glad she did.""Eventually the two were signed to Polydor Records and released their eponymous debut album in 1973. While the album did not do well, it found its way to Mick Fleetwood, who became impressed with Buckingham's guitar skills and wanted to recruit him.      Stevie Nicks joined Fleetwood Mac in 1975 after Mick Fleetwood heard her debut album with her band Buckingham Nicks. (Photo by GAB Archive/Redferns)As Buckingham would not join the band without Nicks, Fleetwood agreed to allow her to join the band as well, and the rest is history.Fleetwood Mac  The first album Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham participated in the 1975 album, ""Fleetwood Mac."" (Photo by Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images)Nicks' first album with the band, ""Fleetwood Mac,"" was a massive success. It featured ""Rhiannon"" and ""Landslide,"" the former going on to find itself on Rolling Stone's list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. As part of the band, Nicks would go on to write some of the bands biggest hits, including ""Dreams,"" off the bands second album together ""Rumours."" The album went on to become the best-selling album of all time to that point, sustaining its spot at number one on the American album charts for 31 weeks straight. It also won a Grammy for album of the year in 1978.  The album featured two different breakup songs, written by both Buckingham and Nicks, as the two broke off their romance two years after joining the band.    ""Even though 'Go Your Own Way' was a little angry, it was also honest. So then I wrote 'Dreams,' and because I'm the chiffony chick who believes in fairies and angels, and Lindsey is a hardcore guy, it comes out differently,"" Nicks wrote in the liner notes for the 2013 reissue of the album. ""Lindsey is saying go ahead and date other men and go live your crappy life, and [I'm] singing about the rain washing you clean. We were coming at it from opposite angles, but we were really saying the same exact thing.""  Fleetwood Mac won a Grammy Award for best album, for their album ""Rumours."" (Photo by Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images)Following the success of ""Rumours,"" Fleetwood Mac released the album ""Tusk"" in 1979, which compared to ""Rumours"" was not as successful, only going on to sell four million copies. They followed that up with ""Mirage"" in 1982, which was much more successful, going double platinum in the U.S., and featured many popular songs such as ""Gypsy,"" which was written by Nicks.  At the height of her fame with Fleetwood Mac, Nicks was in a relationship with the Eagles singer Don Henley and chose to have an abortion after she got pregnant. Nicks credits the success of the band, with her decision not to have any children.""If I had not had that abortion, I’m pretty sure there would have been no Fleetwood Mac. There’s just no way that I could have had a child then, working as hard as we worked constantly,"" she told The Guardian in October 2020. ""And there were a lot of drugs, I was doing a lot of drugs … I would have had to walk away.""    ""And I knew that the music we were going to bring to the world was going to heal so many people’s hearts and make people so happy,"" she continued. ""And I thought: you know what? That’s really important. There’s not another band in the world that has two lead women singers, two lead women writers. That was my world’s mission.""    Stevie Nicks opened up about her decision not to have children, saying there would not have been a Fleetwood Mac if she did.

While she was not able to record much for Fleetwood Mac's next album, ""Tango in the Night"" due to conflicts with her solo career, she wrote many of the songs, and the album became the band's second most successful album.  Nicks' last album with the band in the 90s was ""Behind the Mask,"" for which she wrote four of the songs, including ""Love is Dangerous,"" ""Affairs of the Heart,"" ""Freedom"" and ""The Second Time.""      Stevie Nicks left the band in 1990 after having a falling out with Mick Fleetwood over not being able to use one of her songs on her solo album. (Photo by Gie Knaeps/Getty Images)Following the release of the album and its subsequent tour, Nicks officially left the band following a disagreement with Fleetwood, who would not let her include a song she wrote on her album ""Timespace: The Best of Stevie Nicks,"" because he wanted to use it on a Fleetwood Mac compilation album.In 1998, after a brief reunion with the band, Nicks was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as part of the band.Solo career  Stevie Nicks first started a solo career while still a member of Fleetwood Mac. (Photo by Paul Natkin/WireImage)Despite her success with Fleetwood Mac, Nicks had desires to branch out and record some of the songs she could not as a member of the band, due to constantly having to compromise with the other songwriters in the band wanting their songs on the albums.   Her first solo album, ""Bella Donna,"" was released in 1981 and reached number one on the Billboard Top 200, reaching platinum status and with four singles making the Billboard Top 100. The singles include ""Stop Draggin' My Heart Around,"" ""Leather and Lace,"" ""After the Glitter Fades"" and ""Edge of Seventeen.""  ""It became a song about violent death, which was very scary to me because at that point no one in my family had died,"" Nicks said in commentary for her ""Live In Concert"" video recorded on her Bella Donna tour of ""Edge of Seventeen."" Nicks wrote the song after the assassination of John Lennon in December 1980 and the death of her uncle Jonathon, who passed away from cancer in the same week. Several of the lyrics have hidden meanings, referencing the soul leaving the body and the quickness of her uncle's illness.    She continued in her ""Live In Concert"" video commentary: ""To me, the white-winged dove was for John Lennon the dove of peace, and for my uncle it was the white-winged dove who lives in the saguaro cactus - that's how I found out about the white-winged dove, and it does make a sound like whooo, whooo, whooo.""""I read that somewhere in Phoenix and thought I would use that in this song. The dove became exciting and sad and tragic and incredibly dramatic,"" Nicks added. ""Every time I sing this song I have that ability to go back to that two-month period where it all came down. I've never changed it, and I can't imagine ending my show with any other song. It's such a strong, private moment that I share in this song.""    Stevie Nicks released her first solo album in 1981, and it went on to be a massive hit. (Photo by Larry Hulst/Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images)The success of the album led Rolling Stone to label Nicks as the ""Reigning Queen of Rock and Roll."" With her new moniker, Nicks released her second album, ""The Wild Heart,"" in 1983. The album, which went double platinum, had a different feel, as it was written following the death of her close friend, but featured many popular songs, including ""I Will Run to You,"" ""Stand Back"" and ""Beauty and the Beast.""  Her third studio album, ""Rock A Little,"" was released in 1985. It went double platinum and featured singles ""Talk to Me,"" ""I Can't Wait"" and ""Has Anyone Ever Written Anything For You?"". While touring to promote the song, Nicks made the ultimate decision to go to rehab and kick her longstanding addiction to cocaine. ""I saw how they went down, and a part of me wanted to go down with them,"" she told a U.K. interviewer at the time, referencing Janis Joplin and Jimi Hendrix. ""But then another part of me thought, I would be very sad if some 25-year-old lady rock and roll singer 10 years from now said, 'I wish Stevie Nicks would have thought about it a little more.' That's kind of what stopped me and made me really look at the world through clear eyes.""Nicks then released her fourth studio album, and a compilation album, before leaving Fleetwood Mac. She continued to write music, however she took some time off to overcome her addiction to Klonopin, releasing her fifth solo album in 1994, with her sixth, ""Trouble in Shangri-La,"" following in 2001.

Now, with the latest omicron variant, XBB, fueling a resurgence in cases, the response from China’s government and the public is muted at best.The surge comes about six months after the country dismantled its sprawling infrastructure for dealing with Covid, including harsh lockdowns, mass testing, stifling quarantines and strict mask requirements.“People feel differently about this wave,” said Qi Zhang, 30, who works at a finance company in the northern city of Tianjin. “The last time, everyone was terrified, but now they don’t think it’s a big deal,” she told NBC News on Thursday.Commuters wearing face masks in Beijing on May 26, 2023. Mark Schiefelbein / APThe new wave’s data was revealed by respiratory disease specialist Zhong Nanshan at a medical conference this week in the southern city of Guangzhou. According to state media, he told the audience that the wave that started in late April was “anticipated,” and that his modeling suggested China could be approaching 40 million infections per week. By the end of June, he said, the weekly number of infections will peak at 65 million.The United States, by comparison, was reporting more than 5 million cases a week at its peak last January. Like the U.S., China stopped providing weekly case updates this month, making it difficult to know the true extent of the current outbreak.China’s new ambassador warns of ‘serious difficulties’ in relationship with U.S.May 23, 202302:11The State Department said the U.S., which imposed a testing requirement on travelers from China in January before lifting it in March, was discussing China’s second Covid wave with allies and partners but declined to say whether travel restrictions were under consideration. Spokesperson Matt Miller said the department would monitor the situation in conjunction with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention before updating travel guidelines.“We don’t want to see people anywhere, obviously, suffering from Covid-19,” Miller said Wednesday. The U.S. government remains committed to working with China “on transnational challenges, including on global health matters and maintaining open lines of communication,” he added.Various versions of the omicron subvariants, including XBB 1.5, XBB.1.16, also known as “Arcturus,” and XBB.1.9.1, have been circulating in the U.S. since December and make up nearly all of the current infections in the country. Although the CDC isn’t regularly tracking new cases and the majority of new infections are likely going uncounted, hospitalizations and deaths are continuing to decline in the U.S. Experts suggest the U.S. already has a strong level of immunity against the highly transmissible form of the virus.During China’s first omicron wave in December and January, a different omicron variant was infecting millions of people every day, overwhelming hospitals and crematoriums in cities across the country. Store shelves were emptied of fever medications and schools were shut down. About 80% of China’s 1.4 billion people were infected during that wave, Wu Zunyou, chief epidemiologist at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said in January. But immunity may have waned in the months since, raising the risk of reinfection.Zhong said at the medical conference that the government had given preliminary approval to two vaccines aimed at the XBB subvariants and that others could be approved soon.Commuters wearing masks during the morning rush hour in Beijing on Tuesday.Mark Schiefelbein / APThough China’s current wave will not equal the “tsunami” of cases it experienced in December and January, older people and those with underlying diseases are still relatively under-vaccinated and are at high risk for developing severe disease, said Jin Dong-yan, a virologist at the University of Hong Kong.“But the number is smaller and so the good thing is that the hospitals then can take care of them in a better way,” he said.Joey Wang, 24, a student in Hebei province, said many people were finding Covid symptoms less severe this time around. But public fears also seem to have been eased by the change in government messaging.“No more media coming out trying to terrify the public, no more ‘fight the pandemic’ type of short videos to alert people, and no more hardcore measures like the lockdown,” he said.The Chinese government’s subdued response comes as it is trying to revive the economy and reassure U.S. and other foreign businesses, which would react negatively to the return of restrictions.“Covid-zero enforcement was very interruptive to business,” said Michael Hart, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, “and so we said again and again to the Chinese government, what companies need is stability, clarity, so they can plan.”Zhang, the finance employee, said colleagues who recently tested positive were choosing to come to work anyway, contrasting it with the first wave when everyone spent long periods working from home.“When I look back to such strict Covid measures, it feels like a dream,” she said. “It makes me doubt if all those strict lockdowns were right if we ended up here anyway.”Janis Mackey Frayer reported from Beijing, and Jennifer Jett reported from Hong Kong.Janis Mackey FrayerJanis Mackey Frayer is a Beijing-based correspondent for NBC News.Jennifer JettJennifer Jett is Asia digital editor for NBC News, based in Hong Kong.Dawn Liu, Jace Zhang and Abigail Williams  contributed ","{'neg': 0.06, 'neu': 0.871, 'pos': 0.069, 'compound': 0.7895}",0.7895,"China faces a new Covid wave that could peak at 65 million cases a week

The presence of the suspicious computer code was announced Wednesday by Microsoft in a warning it issued to private sector users of its software. The U.S. territory of Guam is the location of a critical Marine base that would respond to China if it attacked Taiwan. The National Security Agency also issued an alert to electrical utilities, nuclear power stations, water systems, railways and other key sectors that could be vulnerable.“The U.S. intelligence community assesses that China almost certainly is capable of launching cyberattacks that can disrupt critical infrastructure services within the United States,” State Department spokesman Matt Miller told reporters Thursday. “It’s vital for government network defenders in the public to stay vigilant.”U.S. nuclear secrets are vulnerable to spies, report saysMay 25, 202302:51The news comes as U.S. and Chinese officials are holding their first Cabinet-level meetings in Washington during the Biden administration, with Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo meeting with her counterpart, Chinese Commerce Minister Wang Wentao. U.S. officials said that the two had “candid and substantive discussions” Thursday and that Raimondo ""raised concerns"" about recent government actions against U.S. companies operating in China.U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai was also scheduled to meet with Wang. They will both also attend a meeting of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, commonly known as APEC, in Detroit on Friday and Saturday along with ministers from other countries in those regions.Asked whether the new malware could affect the economic talks, Miller said, “We do intend to use our conversations with the Chinese government to press on areas where we have concerns.” Before leaving a summit of leading industrial nations in Japan on Sunday, President Joe Biden expressed optimism that the U.S. and China would soon be able to improve bilateral relations. Tensions heightened after the U.S. shot down a Chinese spy balloon in early February off the South Carolina coast after it crossed the country from Montana to the Atlantic coast. China has maintained it was a weather balloon that had blown off course, repeating that claim most recently in meetings national security adviser Jake Sullivan held with Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang two weeks ago in Vienna. China had earlier halted regular military communications with the Pentagon to protest then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s trip to Taiwan last September. A senior U.S. official told NBC News that the two meetings with the Chinese officials in Washington could bolster Biden’s push for a diplomatic thaw between the two countries. The official suggested that a trip to China by Secretary of State Antony Blinken that was canceled after the balloon was shot down could be rescheduled by August, as well as visits by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, Raimondo and climate envoy John Kerry. But China’s Foreign Ministry reacted harshly to the hacking accusation Thursday, accusing the U.S. of working with its allies to launch a coordinated disinformation campaign.“We noted this extremely unprofessional report, a patchwork with a broken chain of evidence,” ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said. “We also noted that the U.S. National Security Agency and the cybersecurity agencies of the U.K., Australia, Canada and New Zealand, almost simultaneously issued similar reports.”Another negative signal came when China’s newly appointed ambassador to the U.S., Xie Feng, said on arrival Tuesday that “the relationship is faced with serious difficulties and challenges.” On Thursday, Feng met with Victoria Nuland, undersecretary of state for political affairs, at the State Department. Nuland tweeted a photograph of herself shaking hands with the new Chinese envoy and tried to strike an optimistic note about easing tensions, writing, “Open dialogue is critical to managing our relationship.”Andrea MitchellAndrea Mitchell is chief Washington correspondent and chief foreign affairs correspondent for NBC News.Abigail WilliamsAbigail Williams is a producer and reporter for NBC News covering the State Department.Zoë RichardsZoë Richards is the evening politics reporter for NBC News ","{'neg': 0.064, 'neu': 0.887, 'pos': 0.049, 'compound': -0.9146}",-0.9146,"Will Chinese hacking derail U.S. hopes for a thaw with Beijing

At around 230 feet tall and 50 feet wide, its physical stature was surpassed only by its status as a national symbol.Crowds gathered in the center of the capital to see the wrecked trunk for themselves. ""It was regarded as a symbol of liberty and freedom by early settlers"" in the West African country — which was founded by freed American slaves — according to President Julius Maada Bio, who joined the crowds at the site Thursday.“The Cotton Tree wasn’t just a tree,” Bio tweeted, “it was a connection between the past, present and the future.”The centuries-old Cotton Tree in Freetown in 2011.Tommy Trenchard / Alamy Stock PhotoThe great shade of the Cotton Tree had offered returning Black freed slaves a resting place and prayer ground when they arrived by boat in the 1700s, the country's Ministry of Tourism and Cultural Affairs said on its website. While it stood strong in the face of landslides driven by climate change and a lightning strike, a heavy downpour Wednesday night left nothing of the Cotton Tree but a stump.It was “damaged beyond repair,” said Zebek, a press agency working with Sierra Leone’s government, “its entire trunk sheared off a few metres above the ground.”The weight of the loss “is comparable with the 2019 fire that destroyed the Notre Dame cathedral in Paris,” Zebek said. A bulldozer clears the fallen Cotton Tree in downtown Freetown on Thursday.TJ Bade / APFreetown’s city structure sprung from the Cotton Tree’s central position, and the tree became a national icon that appeared on bank notes, featured in lullabies and was a stop for royalty.Queen Elizabeth II visited it in 1961 on a visit marking Sierra Leone’s independence from Britain.As Freetown transformed into an urban city over time, the Cotton Tree “remained a singular oasis of green,” Zebek said. It was a shelter not only for the people, but for vultures that served as literary inspirations for novelists like Graham Greene, who likened them to “broken umbrellas.”This historical painting, shown in 2016, is exhibited in the National Museum of Sierra Leone.Georg Berg / Alamy Stock PhotoBio said that parts of the tree would be preserved in the National Museum.The Ministry of Tourism and Cultural Affairs immediately took action to preserve the remaining trunk and urged the public against cutting away parts from the remains.The government welcomed “public debate on the future use of the site,” Zebek said, and sounded an optimistic note.“When a tree falls naturally due to extreme weather, a new life springs forward,” Bio said. “Together, we will preserve the legacy of unity, freedom and liberty of our iconic Cotton Tree.”Lyme ChoLyme Cho is an intern for NBC News based in London.Reuters and Associated Press contributed ","{'neg': 0.042, 'neu': 0.856, 'pos': 0.102, 'compound': 0.9934}",0.9934,"A tree felled in a storm leaves a nation mourning a 'great loss'

Ethiopia has been asking for the prince's remains and other treasures to be returned for the last 150 years.Fasil Minas, a descendent of the Abyssinian royal family and a relative of Alemayehu, told the BBC: “We want his remains back as a family and as Ethiopians because that is not the country he was born in.”But the palace said this week that this wasn't possible as it would disturb other human remains buried nearby.""The Dean and Canons of Windsor are very sensitive to the need to honour the memory of Prince Alemayehu,"" Buckingham Palace said in a statement sent to NBC News on Tuesday.""However, they have been advised that it is very unlikely that it would be possible to exhume the remains without disturbing the resting place of a substantial number of others in the vicinity,"" the statement said.The Ethiopian Embassy in London is welcome to keep visiting the grave to pay respects, the statement added — but historians said the palace should do more to take responsibility for its past.Staff from the Ethiopian Embassy in London pay tribute to the late prince outside St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle in 2019.@EthioEmbassyUK / Twitter""This is such an emotional issue because it reminds everyone of Alemayehu’s plight — a child stuck in a foreign land, never allowed to go home,"" Andrew Heavens, author of a new book on Alemayehu and the British raid on Abyssinia titled ""The Prince and the Plunder,"" told NBC News. ""Emotionally, most people who get to know Alemayehu’s story feel his remains should be returned. He made it so clear before he died that he wanted to go back,"" Heavens said.The palace could do more to show Ethiopia exactly why the prince's body can't be removed, Heavens added. Alemayehu was the son of the emperor of Abyssinia, Tewodros II, a Coptic Christian ruler who had taken missionaries and British government officials captive after Britain refused to assist him in wars with mostly Muslim neighboring countries.In December 1867, Britain launched an expedition of 13,000 soldiers and 40,000 animals, including 44 elephants trained to pull huge artillery guns, according to the National Army Museum in London, to free the hostages.Alemayehu was an orphan and Captain Speedy, left, became his guardian.V&A Images / Getty ImagesIt took until April for them to reach the Abyssinian capital, Maqdala. More than 500 Abyssinians were killed and thousands injured in a 90-minute battle — some estimates are much higher and no complete contemporary record exists.British forces sustained two deaths, with 18 soldiers injured. Tewodros subsequently killed himself with a pistol that had been a gift from Queen Victoria.It took 15 elephants and around 200 mules to carry all the wealth the British looted from Maqdala. Alemayehu's mother, Empress Tiruwork Wube, intended to travel to England with her son but died on the journey.Queen Victoria took an interest in Alemayehu and arranged for him to study at elite schools, before he was sent to the military training academy at Sandhurst. He left after less than a year for the English city of Leeds, where he died of pleurisy — inflammation of the lining surrounding the lungs — at age 18 in 1879.Victoria wrote in her diary: ""Very grieved and shocked to hear by telegram, that good Alemayehu had passed away this morning. It is too sad! All alone, in a strange country, without a single person or relative, belonging to him."" He was buried in the catacombs of St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle.Tracing the origins of the notorious Kohinoor diamondMay 10, 202303:56For Jeremiah Garsha, an expert in the looting of human remains at University College Dublin, originally from California, there is no doubt that Alemayehu was stolen.""He was, he was kidnapped,"" he said. ""You have a minor coming to another country as an orphan after his mother dies and then he himself dies at 18 — something should feel wrong about that. He's looted as well, like all the other curios and treasures that were taken.""The British obsession with Africa at the time created a huge market for stolen goods. This curiosity extended from ceremonial shields and religious items to living Black African people.""You wouldn't kidnap a white child; Victoria's not going to end up with a child from [London suburb] Camden Town — there has to be a racial element, the foreignness for this prince to come and be at the palace,"" Garsha said.Many of the treasures that were taken remain in the British Museum, which has been discussing the possible return of certain items with Ethiopian officials since 2019.Several other countries, including Benin and Greece, have long petitioned the British government for the return of items that they consider stolen during the colonial era.Patrick SmithPatrick Smith is a London-based editor and reporter for NBC News Digital.Victoria Di Gioacchino contributed ","{'neg': 0.096, 'neu': 0.836, 'pos': 0.068, 'compound': -0.9908}",-0.9908,"Buckingham Palace rejects calls to return remains of 'stolen' prince to Ethiopia

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan at a rally in Sivas earlier this week.Muhammed Selim Korkutata / Anadolu Agency via Getty ImagesPrintMay 28, 2023, 10:22 AM UTCBy Matt Bradley, Paul Goldman and Leila SackurANKARA, Turkey — It’s one of the most hotly contested presidential elections in recent times, but at the Arjantin İlkokulu elementary school in Turkey’s capital Ankara, the mood was quiet, orderly and calm. There was no pushing and shoving as voters waited in short lines to decide whether the country’s long-time leader Recep Tayyip Erdoğan stretches his rule into a third decade or is unseated by challenger Kemal Kilicdaroglu, who has promised to restore a more democratic society. Continuity or change? “I hope it will be good for Turkey,” said geologist Salami Toprak, 67, shortly after he voted. “Let’s see what’s gonna come out.” He added that he was thinking about the next generation as he cast his ballot.  Closely watched from Washington and Kyiv to Moscow and Beijing, the runoff in the Turkish Republic’s centenary year, come s after neither candidate was able to secure more than 50% of the votes in the first ballot on May 14, Erdoğan falling short by a miniscule amount.Kilicdaroglu, 74, has described the run-off as a referendum on the country’s future. The leader of the secular, center-left Republican People’s Party, or CHP, since 2010 is a starkly different figure from Erdoğan, who is known for his bombastic speeches. Softly spoken, he has a reputation as a bridge builder. As well as returning the country to a parliamentary democracy, Kilicdaroglu and the alliance have promised to establish the independence of the judiciary and the central bank, institute checks and balances and reverse the democratic backsliding and crackdowns on free speech and dissent. Ballot papers for the Turkish presidential election at the Arjantin İlkokulu elementary in Turkey's capital Ankara. Paul Goldman / NBC NewsBut Erdoğan is favored to win, after his ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) retained a majority in parliament in the elections earlier this month.  Initially however, he had trailed in opinion polls during a campaign dominated by the fallout from the devastating earthquake that left over 50,000 dead earlier this year and the country’s economic turmoil. Erdoğan increased wages and pensions ahead of the election’s first round, and subsidized electricity costs and gas bills in an attempt to woo voters who have faced a steep cost-of-living and currency crisis precipitated by numerous rate cuts by the government in an attempt to boost exports. Immigration has also been high on the agenda and both candidates have sought to bolster their nationalist credentials ahead of the runoff.Ahead of the first vote, Kilicdaroglu said he intended to repatriate refugees within two years by creating favorable conditions for their return. But he has since toughened his stance and vowed to send all refugees home once he was elected president.Erdoğan, meanwhile, courted and won the backing of the nationalist politician Sinan Ogan, the former academic who was backed for president by an anti-migrant party but was eliminated after finishing third in the first round of voting. On the campaign trail, Ogan said he would consider sending migrants back by force if necessary.   While the economy and migration were important issues, “Erdoğan managed to securitize the elections and convinced his base that national security was at stake,” said Dimitar Bechev, a lecturer on Turkey, Oxford University in the U.K., author of “Turkey under Erdoğan.” He added that “identity politics revolving around ethnicity and religion” had determined much of the allocation of the votes. Turkey presidential elections head to runoffMay 16, 202302:41The results will also have myriad ramifications outside Turkey, which enjoys a strategic location at the crossroads of Europe and Asia. Turkey boasts NATO’s second largest armed forces after the U.S., it controls the crucial Bosporus Strait, and it is widely believed to host U.S. nuclear missiles on its soil. Despite being a NATO member, the country has maintained close ties with Russia and has blocked Sweden’s membership of the Western military alliance. An Erdoğan win would likely deepen the country’s relationship with Moscow, according to Nilgun Arisan Eralp, the director at the Center for E.U. studies at the Economic Policy Research Institute of Turkey in Ankara. “Given the dire straits the economy is in, Russian money will be needed for the regime to continue,” Eralp said, adding that it was likely he would continue to reject Swedish membership of NATO, damaging relations with the United States and drawing the country closer to the Kremlin.Ankara has long accused Sweden of harboring militants from the banned Kurdistan Workers Party, which is a designated terrorist group in Turkey, Sweden, and the United States. Ahead of the vote, Ergun Yayla, a taxi driver from Istanbul  said Saturday that he planned to vote for Erdogan. “I think a political change might be good in our country, but as there is nobody else that I think who is honest and who could be successful,” said Yayla, 55. “The opposition is very weak and they will never win.” Matt Bradley and Paul Goldman reported from Ankara.

Now, with the latest omicron variant, XBB, fueling a resurgence in cases, the response from China’s government and the public is muted at best.The surge comes about six months after the country dismantled its sprawling infrastructure for dealing with Covid, including harsh lockdowns, mass testing, stifling quarantines and strict mask requirements.“People feel differently about this wave,” said Qi Zhang, 30, who works at a finance company in the northern city of Tianjin. “The last time, everyone was terrified, but now they don’t think it’s a big deal,” she told NBC News on Thursday.Commuters wearing face masks in Beijing on May 26, 2023. Mark Schiefelbein / APThe new wave’s data was revealed by respiratory disease specialist Zhong Nanshan at a medical conference this week in the southern city of Guangzhou. According to state media, he told the audience that the wave that started in late April was “anticipated,” and that his modeling suggested China could be approaching 40 million infections per week. By the end of June, he said, the weekly number of infections will peak at 65 million.The United States, by comparison, was reporting more than 5 million cases a week at its peak last January. Like the U.S., China stopped providing weekly case updates this month, making it difficult to know the true extent of the current outbreak.China’s new ambassador warns of ‘serious difficulties’ in relationship with U.S.May 23, 202302:11The State Department said the U.S., which imposed a testing requirement on travelers from China in January before lifting it in March, was discussing China’s second Covid wave with allies and partners but declined to say whether travel restrictions were under consideration. Spokesperson Matt Miller said the department would monitor the situation in conjunction with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention before updating travel guidelines.“We don’t want to see people anywhere, obviously, suffering from Covid-19,” Miller said Wednesday. The U.S. government remains committed to working with China “on transnational challenges, including on global health matters and maintaining open lines of communication,” he added.Various versions of the omicron subvariants, including XBB 1.5, XBB.1.16, also known as “Arcturus,” and XBB.1.9.1, have been circulating in the U.S. since December and make up nearly all of the current infections in the country. Although the CDC isn’t regularly tracking new cases and the majority of new infections are likely going uncounted, hospitalizations and deaths are continuing to decline in the U.S. Experts suggest the U.S. already has a strong level of immunity against the highly transmissible form of the virus.During China’s first omicron wave in December and January, a different omicron variant was infecting millions of people every day, overwhelming hospitals and crematoriums in cities across the country. Store shelves were emptied of fever medications and schools were shut down. About 80% of China’s 1.4 billion people were infected during that wave, Wu Zunyou, chief epidemiologist at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said in January. But immunity may have waned in the months since, raising the risk of reinfection.Zhong said at the medical conference that the government had given preliminary approval to two vaccines aimed at the XBB subvariants and that others could be approved soon.Commuters wearing masks during the morning rush hour in Beijing on Tuesday.Mark Schiefelbein / APThough China’s current wave will not equal the “tsunami” of cases it experienced in December and January, older people and those with underlying diseases are still relatively under-vaccinated and are at high risk for developing severe disease, said Jin Dong-yan, a virologist at the University of Hong Kong.“But the number is smaller and so the good thing is that the hospitals then can take care of them in a better way,” he said.Joey Wang, 24, a student in Hebei province, said many people were finding Covid symptoms less severe this time around. But public fears also seem to have been eased by the change in government messaging.“No more media coming out trying to terrify the public, no more ‘fight the pandemic’ type of short videos to alert people, and no more hardcore measures like the lockdown,” he said.The Chinese government’s subdued response comes as it is trying to revive the economy and reassure U.S. and other foreign businesses, which would react negatively to the return of restrictions.“Covid-zero enforcement was very interruptive to business,” said Michael Hart, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, “and so we said again and again to the Chinese government, what companies need is stability, clarity, so they can plan.”Zhang, the finance employee, said colleagues who recently tested positive were choosing to come to work anyway, contrasting it with the first wave when everyone spent long periods working from home.“When I look back to such strict Covid measures, it feels like a dream,” she said. “It makes me doubt if all those strict lockdowns were right if we ended up here anyway.”Janis Mackey Frayer reported from Beijing, and Jennifer Jett reported from Hong Kong.Janis Mackey FrayerJanis Mackey Frayer is a Beijing-based correspondent for NBC News.Jennifer JettJennifer Jett is Asia digital editor for NBC News, based in Hong Kong.Dawn Liu, Jace Zhang and Abigail Williams  contributed ","{'neg': 0.06, 'neu': 0.871, 'pos': 0.069, 'compound': 0.7895}",0.7895,"China faces a new Covid wave that could peak at 65 million cases a week

The presence of the suspicious computer code was announced Wednesday by Microsoft in a warning it issued to private sector users of its software. The U.S. territory of Guam is the location of a critical Marine base that would respond to China if it attacked Taiwan. The National Security Agency also issued an alert to electrical utilities, nuclear power stations, water systems, railways and other key sectors that could be vulnerable.“The U.S. intelligence community assesses that China almost certainly is capable of launching cyberattacks that can disrupt critical infrastructure services within the United States,” State Department spokesman Matt Miller told reporters Thursday. “It’s vital for government network defenders in the public to stay vigilant.”U.S. nuclear secrets are vulnerable to spies, report saysMay 25, 202302:51The news comes as U.S. and Chinese officials are holding their first Cabinet-level meetings in Washington during the Biden administration, with Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo meeting with her counterpart, Chinese Commerce Minister Wang Wentao. U.S. officials said that the two had “candid and substantive discussions” Thursday and that Raimondo ""raised concerns"" about recent government actions against U.S. companies operating in China.U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai was also scheduled to meet with Wang. They will both also attend a meeting of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, commonly known as APEC, in Detroit on Friday and Saturday along with ministers from other countries in those regions.Asked whether the new malware could affect the economic talks, Miller said, “We do intend to use our conversations with the Chinese government to press on areas where we have concerns.” Before leaving a summit of leading industrial nations in Japan on Sunday, President Joe Biden expressed optimism that the U.S. and China would soon be able to improve bilateral relations. Tensions heightened after the U.S. shot down a Chinese spy balloon in early February off the South Carolina coast after it crossed the country from Montana to the Atlantic coast. China has maintained it was a weather balloon that had blown off course, repeating that claim most recently in meetings national security adviser Jake Sullivan held with Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang two weeks ago in Vienna. China had earlier halted regular military communications with the Pentagon to protest then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s trip to Taiwan last September. A senior U.S. official told NBC News that the two meetings with the Chinese officials in Washington could bolster Biden’s push for a diplomatic thaw between the two countries. The official suggested that a trip to China by Secretary of State Antony Blinken that was canceled after the balloon was shot down could be rescheduled by August, as well as visits by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, Raimondo and climate envoy John Kerry. But China’s Foreign Ministry reacted harshly to the hacking accusation Thursday, accusing the U.S. of working with its allies to launch a coordinated disinformation campaign.“We noted this extremely unprofessional report, a patchwork with a broken chain of evidence,” ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said. “We also noted that the U.S. National Security Agency and the cybersecurity agencies of the U.K., Australia, Canada and New Zealand, almost simultaneously issued similar reports.”Another negative signal came when China’s newly appointed ambassador to the U.S., Xie Feng, said on arrival Tuesday that “the relationship is faced with serious difficulties and challenges.” On Thursday, Feng met with Victoria Nuland, undersecretary of state for political affairs, at the State Department. Nuland tweeted a photograph of herself shaking hands with the new Chinese envoy and tried to strike an optimistic note about easing tensions, writing, “Open dialogue is critical to managing our relationship.”Andrea MitchellAndrea Mitchell is chief Washington correspondent and chief foreign affairs correspondent for NBC News.Abigail WilliamsAbigail Williams is a producer and reporter for NBC News covering the State Department.Zoë RichardsZoë Richards is the evening politics reporter for NBC News ","{'neg': 0.064, 'neu': 0.887, 'pos': 0.049, 'compound': -0.9146}",-0.9146,"Will Chinese hacking derail U.S. hopes for a thaw with Beijing

Naval History and Heritage CommandPrintMay 25, 2023, 1:46 PM UTCBy Lyme ChoWreckage from a U.S. Navy destroyer sunk by a kamikaze aircraft attack during World War II has been discovered by a team of underwater explorers in the Pacific Ocean.  The USS Mannert L. Abele was operating off the northern coast of the Japanese island of Okinawa on April 12, 1945, when it suddenly found itself ""surrounded by hostile planes,” the Naval History and Heritage Command said in a news release this week, as it announced the ship had been identified Thursday.  After the Sumner-class destroyer engaged with and damaged multiple enemy aircraft, a plane managed to crash next to it, penetrating its side, the command said, adding that a minute later it was “at the waterline by a Yokosuka MXY-7 Ohka.” Known as the “Cherry Blossom,” the Ohka was a rocket-powered human-guided bomb “and the resulting explosion caused the ship’s bow and stern to buckle rapidly,” the release said, adding that it became the first U.S. warship sunk by the weapon which was identified as “one of the first cruise missiles,” and fired up to 425 mph. Along with four fighter aircraft, inshore Fire Support ships fought further enemy attacks and began rescuing the Abele's survivors. However, 84 sailors were lost at sea.The ship’s discovery “allows some closure to the families of those lost, and provides us all another opportunity to remember and honor them,” said command Director Samuel J. Cox, a retired U.S. Navy rear admiral.Seen from a U.S. carrier, a Japanese suicide bomber crashes into the sea off the coast of Okinawa, Japan, in June 1945.  APThe ship was found in December by a group called the Lost 52 Project, which searches for Navy submarines and warships sunk during World War II.The Lost 52 Project said in a statement on its website that the ship was providing support for Operation Iceberg, the codename for the Battle of Okinawa. It added that the death of President Franklin D. Roosevelt on the same day “overshadowed,” the sinking. Five weeks later, America dropped atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Tim Taylor, the leader of the Lost 52 Project, said in the statement that the discovery was ""very emotive"" for him because his father had  come ""close to the same fate"" when his ship, the USS Telfair, was hit by a kamikaze attack.  The command said it had established the Abele as “U.S. sunken military craft protected by U.S. law and under the jurisdiction of the Department of the Navy,” and as a war grave of sailors respected by all. Discovery expeditions continue to seek U.S. Navy vessels lost during World War II. Submarine USS Albacore was identified by the command near the coast of Hokkaido in February. Lyme ChoLyme Cho is an intern for NBC News based in London ","{'neg': 0.149, 'neu': 0.805, 'pos': 0.046, 'compound': -0.9965}",-0.9965,"U.S. Navy destroyer sunk in WWII discovered off the Japanese coast

We apologize, this video has expired.Tina Turner dead at 83, known as Queen of Rock 'n' Roll02:03PrintMay 25, 2023, 1:24 PM UTCBy Sky NewsMany Australians feel a special connection to Tina Turner, with one of her early songs having found a unique place in the country’s culture.As fans around the world mourn the singer’s death at the age of 83, many in the country remember growing up learning the line dance to Nutbush City Limits, the song she performed with her then-husband and collaborator Ike in 1973.The song is about life in a small town in Tennessee and, despite it being a far cry from life in Australia, the dance has become a staple of weddings and parties.There are a number of reasons why this is very strange.Turner’s performances of the song never included the dance that has become so loved by Australians, and the song wasn’t even that popular anyway, peaking at number 14 when it was released in the 1970s and then at 16 when it was re-released in 1991.The Big Red Bash is an annual music festival held in the Simpson Desert in outback Queensland. Marc Grimwade / Getty Images fileThe dance is thought to have grown from a scheme combining the creative arts and physical education in primary schools in the states of New South Wales or Queensland.But others say it was never part of Australia’s education curriculum, and was instead spread by individual teachers, copying what they had seen in other schools.Interdisciplinary artist Kay Armstrong first encountered the Nutbush as a primary school student newly-arrived in Western Australia from England in the late 1970s.She told the Sydney Morning Herald in 2018: “We learnt the Nutbush in primary school, and then in high school, and then I’ve probably done it at every wedding I’ve gone to since.”The country’s keenest Nutbush fans have set world records for the largest number of people performing the dance.Some 4,084 people performed the dance at the Birdsville Big Red Bash in Queensland to break the previous record.A month later another 3,700 people gathered for the dance at the Mundi Mundi Bash in Broken Hill, New South Wales, but failed to set a new record.Sky NewsU.K.-based Sky News is owned by Comcast, the parent company of NBC News ","{'neg': 0.06, 'neu': 0.849, 'pos': 0.092, 'compound': 0.9241}",0.9241,"Doing the Nutbush: One country's strange love affair with Tina Turner

Canada, UK, Australia and New Zealand warned they could be targeted by the hackers too.Microsoft analysts said they had “moderate confidence” that this Chinese group, which it dubbed “Volt Typhoon,” was developing capabilities that could disrupt critical communications infrastructure between the United States and the Asia region during future crises.“It means they are preparing for that possibility,” said John Hultquist, who heads threat analysis at Google’s Mandiant Intelligence.The Chinese activity is unique and worrying also because analysts don’t yet have enough visibility on what this group might be capable of, he added.“There is greater interest in this actor because of the geopolitical situation.”As China has stepped up military and diplomatic pressure in its claim to democratically governed Taiwan, U.S. President Joe Biden has said he would be willing to use force to defend Taiwan.Security analysts expect Chinese hackers could target U.S. military networks and other critical infrastructure if China invades Taiwan.The NSA and other Western cyber agencies urged companies that operate critical infrastructure to identify malicious activity using the technical guidance they issued.“It is vital that operators of critical national infrastructure take action to prevent attackers hiding on their systems,” Paul Chichester, director at the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre, said in a joint statement with the NSA.Microsoft said the Chinese hacking group has been active since at least 2021 and has targeted several industries including communications, manufacturing, utility, transportation, construction, maritime, government, information technology and education.NSA cybersecurity director Rob Joyce said the Chinese campaign was using “built-in network tools to evade our defenses and leaving no trace behind.” Such techniques are harder to detect as they use “capabilities already built into critical infrastructure environments,” he added.As opposed to using traditional hacking techniques, which often involve tricking a victim into downloading malicious files, Microsoft said this group infects a victim’s existing systems to find information and extract data.Guam is home to U.S. military facilities that would be key to responding to any conflict in the Asia-Pacific region. It is also a major communications hub connecting Asia and Australia to the United States by multiple submarine cables.Bart Hoggeveen, a senior analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute who specializes in state-sponsored cyber attacks in the region, said the submarine cables made Guam “a logical target for the Chinese government” to seek intelligence.“There is high vulnerability when cables land on shore,” he said.New Zealand said it would work toward identifying any such malicious cyber activity in its country.“It’s important for the national security of our country that we’re transparent and upfront with Australians about the threats that we face,” Australia’s Minister for Home Affairs and Cyber Security Clare O’Neil said.Canada’s cybersecurity agency said it had no reports of Canadian victims of this hacking as yet. “However, Western economies are deeply interconnected,” it added. “Much of our infrastructure is closely integrated and an attack on one can impact the other.”Reuter ","{'neg': 0.091, 'neu': 0.838, 'pos': 0.071, 'compound': -0.9708}",-0.9708,"Chinese hackers are spying on U.S. critical infrastructure, Microsoft and Western intelligence agencies say

It is not clear how the watch came into Puyi’s possession.Patek Philippe watches have long been a collectors’ favorite, and in 2019 a one-of-a-kind Grandmaster Chime from the Swiss manufacturer became the world’s most expensive watch at auction, with a hammer price of $31.2 million.John Ng, a well-known independent watchmaker in Hong Kong who bid unsuccessfully for the emperor’s watch, said its sale could lead to a new trend.“Considering the current popularity of big, simple watches, small and complicated watches will receive more attention after this sale,” he said.Chinese Emperor Puyi in 1935.Universal Image Group / Getty ImagesPuyi was only 2 years old when he became emperor in 1908, leaving his family to move to the Forbidden City in Beijing. He was forced to abdicate in 1912 after the overthrow of the Qing Dynasty, though he continued living in the palace complex for years.In the 1930s, Puyi was appointed puppet leader of Manchuria, the northeastern region that Japan had occupied as part of its invasion of China. He tried to flee after Tokyo’s defeat in 1945 but was captured by Soviet troops and imprisoned in Siberia, where he had the watch with him. In 1950, the Soviet Union returned Puyi to China, where he was jailed for almost 10 years and then lived as a private citizen until his death in 1967 at age 61.Also included in the Hong Kong auction were a manuscript notebook belonging to Puyi, a leather-bound edition of Confucius’ “Analects,” and a red paper fan Puyi inscribed and gave to Permyakov in Tokyo. The fan sold for $77,846, six times the pre-sale estimate, while the other two items sold for a combined $121,634, almost five times the pre-sale estimate.

But since February, Xi has promoted a peace plan, which has been met with skepticism from the West and cautiously welcomed by Kyiv.Last week, China’s special representative for Eurasian affairs Li Hui visited Ukraine and met with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in a European tour that Beijing billed as its effort to promote peace talks and a political settlement of the crisis.Li Hui is scheduled to visit Russia on Friday.Reuter ","{'neg': 0.032, 'neu': 0.875, 'pos': 0.093, 'compound': 0.9886}",0.9886,"Russia and China seal economic pacts despite Western disapproval

China’s new ambassador warns of ‘serious difficulties’ in relationship with U.S.02:11PrintMay 23, 2023, 9:54 PM UTCBy Keir Simmons, Alexander Smith and Phil McCauslandThere are signs of deepening distrust between the United States and China even as the Biden administration and Beijing appeared to work to restart high-level talks. President Joe Biden this weekend predicted a “thaw very soon” between Washington and Beijing, the world’s largest economies. Tuesday’s arrival of Xie Feng, Beijing’s new ambassador in Washington, after more than four months, was a potential indication of warming ties, but the new envoy said the two countries’ relationship faced “serious difficulties and challenges.”“We hope that the United States will work together with China to increase dialogue, to manage differences and also to respect our cooperation so that our relationship will be back to the right track,” he told a small crowd made up mostly of journalists at New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport before climbing into a van with aides and members of his family. Xie Feng, China's new ambassador to the United States, upon his arrival at the John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York on Tuesday.Li Rui / APWhile Xie may have been cautiously upbeat, a senior Chinese diplomat recently shared a gloomier assessment of U.S.-China relations at a briefing. “The bilateral relationship has once again encountered a freeze,” the Chinese diplomat told NBC News, speaking on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak publicly on the matter. The conflicting signals serve to show what a roller coaster the countries’ relations have been on. Beijing reacted angrily to last weekend’s Group of Seven, or G7, summit in Hiroshima, Japan, which pledged to cooperate with China economically but be tougher in areas including “economic coercion,” human rights, Taiwan, Tibet, Hong Kong and Beijing’s growing assertiveness in the South China Sea. Beijing branded the communiqué “smears and lies.”Things were looking up six months ago after Biden’s meeting with President Xi Jinping in Indonesia, igniting hopes for a new chapter. But relations plummeted to a decades-low nadir and a planned trip to Beijing by Secretary of State Antony Blinken was canceled after a “spy balloon” was spotted allegedly gathering information by flying over sensitive U.S. military sites in February. China, which apologized for the incident soon after the vessel appeared over the West Coast but later took a more defensive stance, says it was an unmanned civilian weather balloon.Biden and Xi met on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Bali, Indonesia on Nov. 14, raising hopes that relations between the two countries would improve.Alex Brandon / AP fileAn hours-long meeting between national security adviser Jake Sullivan and China’s most senior diplomat, Wang Yi, on May 11 reignited predictions of new high-level talks. Days earlier and after a practical freeze in diplomatic high-level communications between the two countries, U.S. Ambassador to China Nicholas Burns met with Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang in Beijing. Then came this weekend’s G7 and China’s furious reaction to it.But before high-level diplomacy can move forward — with one of Biden’s Cabinet members visiting Beijing or a call between Biden and Xi — there are a number of obstacles China believes need to be addressed, according to the Chinese diplomat who spoke to NBC News, as well as public comments by Chinese state media and officials.The unnamed Chinese diplomat, who is based in Washington, highlighted three examples of “concerns yet to be addressed by the U.S. side.”Among these is the ongoing FBI investigation into the Chinese balloon shot down by the U.S., they said. Privately, Chinese officials express concern that publication of that investigation might force either side into an embarrassing cancellation of another meeting or call between Xi and Biden.China urges U.S. to ‘take practical actions’ on bilateral relationsMay 23, 202300:32The Biden administration has indicated it wants to move on.At the G7, Biden dismissed the so-called spy balloon as a “silly balloon.” Blinken, meanwhile, did not mention it in his opening remarks at a congressional hearing last week. The unnamed Chinese diplomat said another concern “yet to be addressed by the U.S. side” is the “false accusations,” as the diplomat put it, that China has been operating illegal police stations in New York and elsewhere around the world. The FBI has arrested two people accused of running one of these police stations in New York, just one of dozens of similar investigations in Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany and the Netherlands. China says the stations are there to help the diaspora with administrative issues.The diplomat appeared to rule out a Biden-Xi phone call in the near future. “It is hoped that the U.S. will work with China to address the issues in the relationship, and create favorable conditions for future interactions between the two top leaders,” the diplomat added.Favorable conditions will be hard to achieve, not least because politicians in the U.S. have largely coalesced around the subject of China.“China is an adversary to the United States in every way,” Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., said in reaction to the diplomat’s comments. “We cannot afford to be complacent or passive in the face of China’s continued aggression,” she added in a statement to NBC News.Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., a longtime China hawk, stressed the importance of a bipartisan approach toward Beijing earlier in May.“If we in America rest on our laurels, if we let the CCP beat us, it would have serious consequences for the world’s democratic nations,” he said, referring to the Chinese Communist Party. U.S. Navy sailors off the coast of South Carolina recover parts of the ""spy balloon"" on Feb. 5.Petty Officer 1st Class Tyler Thompson / U.S. NavyChina, meanwhile, appears to believe that it can forge closer ties with the United States’ European allies.A succession of Chinese diplomats have been touring the continent, including Foreign Minister Qin Gang and Wang Yi, the director of the Office of the Central Commission of Foreign Affairs. This week Li Hui, China’s Ukraine envoy, will continue a tour of Ukraine, Poland, Germany, France and Russia. At the G7, an idea promoted by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen gained traction. Rather than “decouple” from China, the West should “derisk” trade in industries where national interests are at stake. In other words, Europe should continue to have a dialogue and trade with China but also challenge Beijing when necessary and protect its vital industries. This comes even as Europe and the U.S. grow closer on the subject of China, according to Ian Bremmer, the president of political risk and research consulting firm Eurasia Group, author of “Superpower: Three Choices for America’s Role in the World” and a frequent commentator on world affairs. “China is consolidating economic power in ways that all of the G7 allies find problematic,” he said Tuesday.But Von der Leyen, and Europe in general, are not tough enough on China for many in Washington. “Our European allies need to make a decision,” Mace said. “They must choose whether to stand with China or to stand alongside the United States, and we cannot allow them to continue to play both sides.”And if Chinese state-controlled media is taken as a barometer of the elite’s view of the United States and the state of the relationship, nobody in Beijing is holding their breath.“Talk for the sake of talk will do little to remove the obstacles in the path of a sound relationship, which entails Washington’s concrete steps to demonstrate complete sincerity, and deliver on its promises,” according to an article in state news agency Xinhua earlier this month.  Keir SimmonsKeir Simmons is Chief International Correspondent for NBC News, based in London.Alexander SmithAlexander Smith is a senior reporter for NBC News Digital based in London.Phil McCauslandPhil McCausland is an NBC News reporter.Natasha Lebedeva, The Associated Press and Reuters contributed ","{'neg': 0.039, 'neu': 0.878, 'pos': 0.083, 'compound': 0.9958}",0.9958,"What China wants to improve relations with U.S. and why it may be a tall order

Kami Rita went on to the peak three days later for the 27th time.With a few more days left in the spring climbing season, both Sherpa guides were on the mountain helping their clients up the snowy peak. May is the busiest month to make the dangerous climb since it has the best weather conditions.Kami Rita first summitted Everest in 1994 and has been making the trip nearly every year since. He is one of many Sherpa guides whose expertise and skills are vital to the safety and success each year of foreign climbers who seek to stand on top of the mountain.His father was among the first Sherpa guides. In addition to his Everest climbs, Rita has scaled several other peaks that are among the world’s highest, including K2, Cho Oyu, Manaslu and Lhotse.Hundreds of climbers have scaled Mount Everest, or plan to make their attempt, this month.The Nepalese authorities have issued about 480 climbing permits to foreign climbers, which is the most issued for any year. At least as many local Sherpa guides would be accompanying them during the climbing season.So far, 10 people have died during this year’s spring climbing season on Everest.The Associated Pres ","{'neg': 0.024, 'neu': 0.912, 'pos': 0.065, 'compound': 0.9574}",0.9574,"Sherpa guide Kami Rita scales Mount Everest for a record 28th time

Topics included a push to have a president replace the British monarch as Australia’s head of state and Indigenous suffering from colonization.Critics complained that the ABC had soured the celebratory mood of the coronation.His supporters say inaccurate and inflammatory reporting of his views in the mainstream media has fueled racially abusive and threatening personal attacks on social media, wearing the news veteran down.After more than 30 years of news experience in Australian television, Grant wrote Friday in his regular ABC online column that Monday would be the last time in the foreseeable future that he would host “Q+A” because of the news media and social media abuse.“I take time out because we have shown again that our history — our hard truth — is too big, too fragile, too precious for the media. The media sees only battle lines, not bridges. It sees only politics,” Grant wrote. “The media has turned public discussion into an amusement park. Social media, at its worst, is a sordid spectacle. A grotesque burlesque. Lives are reduced to mockery and ridicule.”“I want no part of it. I want to find a place of grace far from the stench of the media,” Grant said.Grant was asked to participate on the panel “as a Wiradjuri man to discuss his own family’s experience and the role of the monarchy in Australia in the context of Indigenous history,” said Justin Stevens, ABC news director.“The responsibility for the coverage lies with ABC news management, not with Stan Grant,” Stevens said.Australian Broadcasting Corp. staff and other supporters gathered at the company offices in Sydney on Monday in support of Grant. Rick Rycroft / APHundreds of ABC colleagues, journalists and supporters carrying signs, including “We stand with Stan” and “We reject racism,” gathered outside the ABC’s Sydney headquarters Monday afternoon in a show of support for Grant.Grant’s journalist daughter Lowanna Grant told the crowd about the toll racist abuse had taken on their family.“It’s really hard to see him struggling, and that he’s had to cop (endure) the racism and disgusting filth that’s been online,” she said.Her mother and Stan Grant’s first wife, Karla Grant — also an Indigenous reporter — told the gathering that racial abuse was an ongoing issue for Indigenous journalists as well as the Grant family.“It’s an accumulation of years and years of racism our people have had to face,” Karla Grant said.Indigenous journalist Narelda Jacobs said she also experienced personal attacks for sharing Indigenous perspectives.“To see him now stepping down indefinitely from one of the most senior positions in Australia, it feels like a grieving. It feels like a sense of loss,” Jacobs said.“We’ve all experienced personal attacks. Every time I’m asked to talk about something that I feel passionately about, I have to take a moment and consider whether it’s really worth it,” Jacobs said.Indigenous Australians account for 3.2% of the national population and are Australia’s most disadvantaged ethnic minority.Associated Pres ","{'neg': 0.129, 'neu': 0.777, 'pos': 0.094, 'compound': -0.9912}",-0.9912,"Australian Indigenous TV host quits program over racist backlash

It was the site of fierce battles during World War II, and with a population of nearly 10 million people, it’s the most populous Pacific Island nation.The State Department said the new agreement provides a framework to help improve security cooperation, enhance the capacity of Papua New Guinea’s defense force and increase regional stability. The full agreement will be made public once politicians in both countries have an opportunity for input, likely in a couple of months.At a breakfast meeting, Papua New Guinea Prime Minister James Marape said his country faces significant security challenges, from skirmishes within the country to illegal fishing boats that light up the night like skyscrapers.“We have our internal security as well as our sovereignty security issues,” Marape said. “We’re stepping up on that front to make sure our borders are secure.”Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Papua New Guinea's Defence Minister Win Bakri Daki in Port Moresby on May 22, 2023. Adek Berry / AFP - Getty ImagesBut the agreement sparked student protests in the second-largest city, Lae. And many in the Pacific are concerned about the increasing militarization of the region.Student Naomi Kipoi, 17, said she was opposed to the security pact because she felt it means the U.S. could come to her country whenever it pleased without permission. She said China had been a big help to her country by building roads and funding schools.“The U.S. didn’t help us with aid and other things,” Kipoi said. “They’re just trying to sign the agreement.”Last year, nearby Solomon Islands signed its own security pact with China, a move that raised alarm throughout the Pacific. The U.S. has increased its focus on the Pacific, opening embassies in Solomon Islands and Tonga, reviving Peace Corps volunteer efforts, and encouraging more business investment.But some have questioned how reliable a partner the U.S. is in the Pacific, particularly after President Joe Biden canceled his plans to make an historic stop in Papua New Guinea to sign the pact. Biden would have been the first sitting U.S. president to visit any Pacific Island country, but he ended up canceling to focus on the debt limit talks back at home.U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken traveled in Biden’s place, arriving in Papua New Guinea early Monday. In response to news of Blinken’s impending visit, China warned against the introduction of “geopolitical games” into the region.As well as the defense pact, the U.S. also signed a maritime agreement with Papua New Guinea which will allow the U.S. Coast Guard to partner with the Pacific nation to counter illegal fishing and drug smuggling.The U.S. visit coincided with a trip by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was hosting a meeting with Pacific Island leaders to discuss ways to better cooperate.Blinken met with New Zealand Prime Minister Chris Hipkins and said the two nations had a shared vision for the region.“To make sure that it remains free, open, secure and prosperous,” Blinken said.Hipkins told Blinken he was very happy that Blinken had made the trip.“The increased U.S. presence in the Pacific is something we welcome,” Hipkins said.But Hipkins also drew a distinction to his own nation’s efforts.“We are not interested in the militarization of the Pacific,” Hipkins told reporters before the Blinken meeting. “We are interested in working with the Pacific on issues where we have mutual interest. Issues around climate change. And we’re not going to be attaching military strings to that support.”Hipkins was one of the few leaders to venture out publicly. He got a rapturous reception from hundreds of well-wishers when he visited Gordons Market, a large fruit and vegetable market.Associated Pres ","{'neg': 0.036, 'neu': 0.836, 'pos': 0.128, 'compound': 0.9956}",0.9956,"U.S. signs new security pact with Papua New Guinea amid competition with China

One China,” he said.His Weibo account said on Monday that he was banned from posting for “violating relevant laws and regulations.” Ng’s agency did not respond to a request for comment.A Chinese comedian, meanwhile, could face jail time as police and government departments investigate him for a joke he made at a performance earlier in May.Beijing police announced last Wednesday that they were investigating comedian Li Haoshi “for severely insulting” the People’s Liberation Army.The comedian, who goes by the stage name HOUSE, made a joke about stray dogs by riffing on a well-known propaganda slogan used to describe the Chinese military.Li said he had adopted two dogs who were very energetic when they went after squirrels, shooting off like artillery shells after a target.Usually, he said, dogs are cute and melt your heart, but when he sees his two dogs, he thinks of the Chinese phrase, “Able to win battles, with first-rate style.”The phrase was first used 10 years ago by Chinese leader Xi Jinping to describe planned reforms for the Chinese military, according to the China Media Project, which studies Chinese media.A government department known as Beijing’s Comprehensive Team of Law Enforcement on Cultural Market said in a statement last week it had received tips from the public about Li’s performance on May 13 and in response launched an investigation into the company Li is signed with.The law enforcement team said it would fine the company, Xiao Guo Wenhua, about $2 million (13.3 million yuan). The company did not respond to a request for comment.An officer who did not give his name at Beijing’s police headquarters declined to say whether Li was under detention or arrest, saying the investigation was continuing and the results would be publicized accordingly.Associated Pres ","{'neg': 0.033, 'neu': 0.862, 'pos': 0.105, 'compound': 0.9781}",0.9781,"Comedian Uncle Roger silenced on Chinese social media after jokes about China

Peace will become closer today.”Wearing his trademark green military fatigues, he shook hands with officials  before he was whisked off to the G7 summit, where he met with several heads of state, including British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and French President Emmanuel Macron. He was also expected to meet with President Joe Biden and deliver a speech.

(Kyodo News via AP)APAlso on the agenda is a tour of a Hiroshima museum dedicated to the atomic bomb attack that leveled the city at the end of World War II. The visit to the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum will likely have special resonance for Zelenskyy, whose small country is at war with a nuclear-armed power.In the run-up to the three-day event, participants had expected the Ukrainian leader to appear at least virtually. Until Friday, there had been no confirmation that Zelenskyy would make the potentially dangerous trip from Kyiv, the farthest he has traveled from his country since last year’s invasion.Biden adds meeting with Zelenskyy to schedule during G-7 summitMay 20, 202302:55He landed hours after the U.S. agreed to allow training on American-made F-16 fighter jets, laying the groundwork for their eventual transfer to Ukraine. White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan later told reporters in Japan that Biden had shared plans with G7 allies — Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada — to supply the aircraft.“Over the past few months, we and our allies and partners have really focused on providing Ukraine with the systems, weapons and training that it needs to be able to conduct effective offensive operations this spring and summer,” Sullivan said. “We have delivered what we promised, we have given Ukraine what it needs based on close consultations between our military and theirs, and now, we have turned to discussions about improving the Ukrainian air force as part of our long-term commitment to Ukraine self defense.”Sullivan suggested that the fighter jets were part of that commitment, and that as the training unfolds in the coming months, the United States would work with allies to determine details about delivery of the jets, including how many would be sent.The timing for when Ukraine will receive the fighter jets — and which countries will provide them — remains unclear, but a senior Biden administration official told NBC News Friday the planes would not be used for Ukraine’s upcoming counteroffensive against Russia.Sullivan also told reporters that he believed it was “a safe bet” that  Biden would meet with Zelenskyy at the summit.U.S. and G7 allies agree to send F-16 fighter jets to UkraineMay 19, 202303:01The G7 vowed to intensify the pressure on Russia in a joint statement Saturday.“Russia’s brutal war of aggression represents a threat to the whole world in breach of fundamental norms, rules and principles of the international community. We reaffirm our unwavering support for Ukraine for as long as it takes to bring a comprehensive, just and lasting peace,” it said.Russia is now the most-sanctioned country in the world, and the latest measures aimed at Moscow include tighter restrictions on previously sanctioned people and firms involved in the war effort. “Our support for Ukraine will not waver,” the statement said. The G7 leaders also vowed “to stand together against Russia’s illegal, unjustifiable and unprovoked war of aggression against Ukraine.“Russia started this war and can end this war,” they said.Peter Nicholas reported from Hiroshima and Leila Sackur from London.Peter NicholasPeter Nicholas is a senior national political reporter for NBC News.Leila Sacku ","{'neg': 0.087, 'neu': 0.843, 'pos': 0.07, 'compound': -0.9788}",-0.9788,"Zelenskyy says peace will become ‘closer’ as he makes dramatic visit to Japan for G7 summit

Russia-China border town shows countries’ deepening ties02:17PrintMay 20, 2023, 10:00 AM UTCBy Janis Mackey Frayer, Dawn Liu and Jennifer JettHEIHE, China — For about 1,000 miles, China and Russia are separated by the vast Amur River — a symbol of the countries’ tense and complicated history. A Russian flag could be seen fluttering across the frozen river from the Chinese border town of Heihe. From here, the two look a lot more like friends than rivals. The two countries’ close ties were on vivid display in this trading outpost when NBC News visited recently. Trucks loaded with goods regularly crossed the Amur, known in China as the Heilong, along a new bridge linking Heihe to Blagoveschchensk, its sister city in Russia. The Russian influence in Heihe, such as the Russian-style domes or spires that top Chinese-style apartment towers, schools, museums and even some government buildings, draws tourists from all over China.People cross the road outside a mall emblazoned with Russian and Chinese inscriptions in the city of Heihe in northern China last month.Fred Dufour / NBC NewsSanctioned by the United States and allies for its war on Ukraine, Russia has found an economic lifeline in neighboring China, with which it declared a “no limits” partnership weeks before the Ukraine invasion in February 2022. Bilateral trade grew almost 30% last year, according to Chinese customs figures, and Russia was China’s top oil supplier in the first two months of the year.“It’s very obvious Russia is increasingly dependent on China, even though Russians may not like that,” said Jon Yuan Jiang, a China-Russia relations expert in Sydney.Heihe, a city of some 1.5 million people, is largely bilingual, with shop names, street signs and menus written in Chinese and Russian. Local business owners, even fruit vendors and roadside popcorn makers, greet foreigners in simple Russian, a skill they learned before the pandemic when Russian customers came in large numbers.“When the border trade was not affected by the pandemic, we could see Russians everywhere on the street, just like meeting with old friends,” a man who identified himself only by his surname, Shi, 70, told NBC News while walking his dog in a riverside park with large sculptures of Russian dolls.Between the Ukraine conflict and strict “zero-Covid” policies that China only recently ended, there have been fewer visitors from across the border, said Tang Lu, the owner of a Russian-style bar whose customers are mainly Russians.“But Chinese people also like this place, and they may sing and interact with Russians,” she said.A customer shops underneath a Russian flag in a supermarket in Heihe. Bloomberg via Getty Images fileWhile China and Russia have a long and often acrimonious relationship dating back centuries, the war in Ukraine has pushed them closer together, with China supporting Russia politically and economically and repeating Russian talking points.Chinese President Xi Jinping is trying to strike a delicate balance in his approach to the Ukraine conflict, Jiang said. China has sought to portray itself as neutral, refusing to condemn Russia’s aggression or even call it an invasion, while also calling for peace talks. Xi and Russian President Vladimir Putin, who describe each other as friends, have talked multiple times since the war began and met in Moscow last month. Meanwhile, there is no indication when Xi will speak with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, with whom he spoke late last month for the first time since the invasion.“China doesn’t really want to support Russia in Russia’s aggression against Ukraine, but China does not want Vladimir Putin to fail as well,” fearing he could be replaced with a pro-Western government, Jiang said. Chinese efforts to appear aloof from the conflict took a hit after Beijing’s ambassador to France said the countries in eastern Europe that gained independence following the Soviet Union’s fall in 1991 did not have “effective” sovereign status in international law, prompting a furious response from European officials.The cross-border bridge that links the Chinese city of Heihe with the Russian city of Blagoveshchensk.Fred Dufour / NBC NewsChina appeared to downplay Lu’s remarks, affirming the former Soviet nations’ sovereignty and emphasizing its preferred role as an honest broker in the war.A major reason China has avoided supporting Russia too openly, Jiang said, is it doesn’t want to jeopardize its vision of a multipolar international order that is less dominated by the United States. It especially wants to avoid alienating Europe, which also aspires to a larger global role.“If China is still trying to have a multipolar world, China needs the support of the E.U.,” he said.For that same reason, Jiang said he did not think China would provide Russia with lethal military assistance, which the Biden administration has warned Beijing against. Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang said this month that China would not sell weapons to either side in the war. China has tried to position itself as a potential peacemaker in Ukraine, releasing a 12-point proposal in February that the West has dismissed as too favorable to Russia. The attempts at mediation are part of a broader effort by Xi to present himself as a global statesman and China as an alternative to American power. Last month, Beijing brokered a surprise deal between Saudi Arabia and Iran to restore diplomatic ties for the first time in seven years.China’s Xi visits Putin in Moscow to underline ‘no-limits’ friendshipMarch 21, 202301:07Experts say the shifts in the China-Russia relationship have mostly been to China’s benefit. Western sanctions have made Russia more dependent on China’s currency, the yuan, which Beijing is trying to internationalize. The yuan has replaced the U.S. dollar as the most traded currency on the Moscow Exchange, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, and Bangladesh recently agreed to use yuan to pay for a nuclear plant Russia is building in the South Asian country, Reuters reported.Russia’s growing isolation has also created opportunities for Chinese companies. With tech giants like Apple and Samsung having reduced their operations in the country, more than 70% of Russia’s smartphones now come from Chinese manufacturers like Xiaomi, Reuters reported, citing a statement from the consumer electronics retailer M.Video-Eldorado.But the war in Ukraine still casts a big shadow in border towns like Heihe.“I was in shock and disbelief when the war broke out,” said Shi, the resident in the park. “After all, the war can only bring harm to the people of two countries. I wish the war can end as soon as possible.”CORRECTION (May 20, 2023, 5:45 p.m. ET) A previous version of this article misstated the timing of when Chinese President Xi Jinping and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy were last in contact.

A Western official confirmed to NBC News that Zelenskyy is expected to attend the summit in person.In the run-up to the G-7 summit, participants had expected him to appear at least virtually. But until Friday, there had been no confirmation that he would make the potentially dangerous trip from Kyiv, the furthest he will have traveled from his country since last year's invasion.Biden joined other world leaders to lay wreaths at the Peace Memorial Park in Hiroshima on Friday. Japan has sought to ensure that the symbolic location will mean a focus on arms control.Pool via AFP - Getty ImagesAsked if President Joe Biden would have a face-to-face meeting with Zelenskyy at the summit, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters, “I think it’s a safe bet that President Biden will meet him, but I don’t have a formal announcement of that.”John Kirby, a spokesman for the White House’s National Security Council, earlier said that Zelenskyy ""was always going to participate in the G-7 in some form or fashion.""""It's really important right now, at this inflection point in the war in Ukraine, that G-7 leaders hear directly from him about conditions on the ground and what he needs going forward,"" Kirby said.A charismatic presence in his trademark green fatigues, Zelenskyy will presumably make the case that his nation’s survival hinges on a continued flow of money and sophisticated weaponry from the United States and its allies. Before heading to Japan, he was in Saudi Arabia for the Arab League summit Friday, seeking closer ties with countries beyond the West. He then heads to the G-7 summit that has already agreed on new steps to make the war costlier for Russia. Biden attended a working luncheon Friday focused on the conflict — with papers spread across a round table and flags of each country in the background. Present were the leaders of Japan, Germany, France, Italy, Canada, the United Kingdom, the European Commission and the European Council.Ukraine's Zelenskyy tells Arab League leaders that Russia is 'weak'May 19, 202301:00A subsequent joint statement released by the G-7 leaders laid out a series of new sanctions. Looking to undercut the Kremlin's war-making capacity, the nations agreed to restrict exports to Russia that include industrial machinery, tools and technology.“We will starve Russia of G-7 technology, industrial equipment and services that support its war machine,” the statement reads.Biden later tweeted, ""In lockstep with my fellow G7 Leaders, we’ve placed on Russia the largest set of sanctions and export control actions ever imposed on a major economy.""""Today, we’re taking more action — disrupting Russia’s ability to source inputs for its war, closing evasion loopholes, restricting their access to the international finance system, and reducing reliance on Russian energy,"" Biden added.Ahead of the summit, a Biden official speaking on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on the record, said, “Our commitment to continue tightening the screws on Russia remains as strong as it was last year.”But recent polling shows that Americans are tiring of the war and are eager to see an end date. Russia failed to swiftly conquer its smaller neighbor but has given no sign that it is prepared to withdraw its forces. Nor is Kyiv about to surrender. Ukraine is readying a counteroffensive to retake occupied land and showcase the difference Western support can make on the battlefield.Biden, who last saw Zelenskyy in person during a surprise trip to Kyiv three months ago, vowed at the time that the U.S. would stand with Ukraine for “as long as it takes.”Zelenskyy was greeted by Saudi officials upon his arrival in Jeddah on Friday.Saudi Press Agency / APThat open-ended commitment will test the resolve and patience of Americans in an election season, as the Biden administration spends billions to help keep Ukraine in the fight. The war figures to be an issue in the 2024 presidential race. Republican front-runner Donald Trump has stopped short of saying he wants Ukraine to win and told a recent CNN town hall that, if elected, he’d end the conflict in 24 hours by meeting with Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin.An unexpected domestic problem has intruded on Biden's trip: the debt ceiling fight back in Washington. Biden had originally planned to visit Papua New Guinea and Australia as part of an effort to rally U.S allies and curb China's growing influence in the Pacific. He canceled those legs of the trip so that he could return to the White House on Sunday and resume talks over raising the debt ceiling and averting an unprecedented default that could have global implications. Biden left a group dinner a little early Friday to get an update from his negotiating team, the White House said.Biden not closing the door on sending fighter jets to Ukraine, Kirby saysMay 18, 202301:51""It's a minor miracle that Biden went ahead with the trip to Hiroshima,"" said Daniel Russel, former director of Asian affairs in the Obama White House. ""I'm glad he did and we should all pray that this gets wrapped up, because the consequences would be devastating -- and not only for the U.S. Everyone is concerned,"" he said referring to the debt ceiling fight.Beyond sanctions, Zelenskyy has asked for advanced F-16s to help repel Russian forces. The U.S. and its allies now plan to provide the fighter jets to Ukraine, a senior Biden administration official said Friday, although they may not necessarily come directly from the United States.For months, the Biden administration has declined to provide the planes out of concern that weapons capable of reaching Russian soil would risk escalating the war. But the U.S. has invited Ukrainian pilots to train on simulators to assess how long it would take them to learn to fly the aircraft.At the summit, Zelenskyy will have a fresh opportunity to engage with allies.“It’s very helpful,"" Russel said of Zelenskyy's visit. ""If the industrialized countries get Ukraine fatigue before Russia gets war fatigue and tired of fighting, then there’s going to be a big problem. Zelenskyy has been brilliant in ensuring that the world sees the situation for what it is, and that it doesn’t burn out and get tired.”The summit's location is symbolic of the mortal threat that is an everyday concern for Ukraine, as well as Asian countries living in the shadow of nuclear-armed China and North Korea.During World War II, the U.S. leveled Hiroshima with a single atomic bomb. On Friday morning, Biden and his counterparts toured the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum and met a woman who survived the attack.In the park outside, the leaders laid wreaths and planted a tree overlooking the skeletal remains of a once-domed building that Japan has preserved as a reminder of the bomb's toll.Peter NicholasPeter Nicholas is a senior national political reporter for NBC News.Kristen WelkerKristen Welker is chief White House correspondent for NBC News.Peter AlexanderPeter Alexander is chief White House correspondent for NBC News.Sally Bronston, Daryna Mayer and Yuliya Talmazan contributed ","{'neg': 0.092, 'neu': 0.803, 'pos': 0.106, 'compound': 0.8046}",0.8046,"Russia hit with new sanctions as Zelenskyy is set to join world leaders at G-7 summit in Japan

He will also attend a meeting of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation trade ministers during his trip.In recent years, top U.S. and China commerce officials have rarely held meetings. Wang last spoke to Raimondo in 2021 in an introductory call, and he spoke with Tai on the sidelines of last year's APEC meeting. Tensions between the two superpowers have escalated under the Biden and Trump administrations, and relations in recent months have been further strained by the 200-foot-tall Chinese airship, which the U.S. called a spy balloon designed for eavesdropping.Still, the U.S. and China remain important trade partners. In 2022, bilateral trade hit a historic high of nearly $760 billion, according to the embassy briefing.""This fully demonstrates the strong complementarity between the two countries and resilience of the economic and trade relationship,"" Liu said. ""This bilateral relationship cannot be simplistically defined by 'competition.""Representatives for Raimondo and Tai did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The expected trade talks next week come after NBC News reported last month that a breakdown in communication between Washington and Beijing is raising the risk of an unintended crisis or conflict between the two nations.Rose HorowitchRose Horowitch is an intern with NBC News Digital Politics.

Australian woman, 95, is in critical condition after police fired stun gun at her02:22PrintMay 19, 2023, 2:00 PM UTCBy Lyme ChoA 95-year-old woman is in critical condition after police in Australia shocked her with a stun gun as she approached them with a walking frame and a steak knife at her nursing home.  Clare Nowland, who has dementia, was taken down by a senior constable, Peter Cotter, the assistant commissioner of New South Wales Police told a news conference Friday. At the time, ""she was approaching police, but it is fair to say at a slow pace,” he said. “She had a walking frame, but she had a knife.”He added that an internal investigation had been launched into the incident Wednesday at the Yallambee Lodge nursing home in Cooma, a small town around 240 miles south of Sydney.        After responding to a call about a patient having a knife in her possession, Cotter said Nowland was found in a “small confined” treatment room by two officers who arrived at the scene.Police fired a stun gun at Clare Nowland, 95, in a care home.Reuters TV“Negotiations commenced for her to drop the knife. For whatever reasons, Clare did not do that,” he said, adding that the senior constable activated his stun gun, which are widely known as Tasers after a major manufacturer. “I can’t take it any further as to what was going through anyone’s mind,” Cotter said.   The 5-foot-2 woman, who weighs 95 pounds, fell to the ground and struck her head.   Paramedics transferred Nowland to a nearby hospital where her head injury has rendered her bedridden. “She remains in and out of consciousness,” Cotter said.He added that she had left her bedroom and obtained the knife from the kitchen at Yallambee Lodge, a 93-room facility which “offers a range of accommodation and support options for those with higher care needs, dementia and respite care for both individuals and couples,” according to its website.NBC News has reached out to Yallambee Lodge for comment. Community advocate Andrew Thaler, who is assisting the family, said Friday that they were “shocked, confused, angry, and hurt” by the incident.“There was nothing she could do with the knife,” he said. “I bet all she could do was hurt herself. The police and the nurses are trained to treat people with dementia, if they can’t do that, why is she there?”The Yallambee Lodge facility in Cooma, Australia.Lukas Coch / APNowland, a long-standing member of the community, ran charity shops, was a regular churchgoer and cooked meals for the other elderly people through outreach work, Thaler said.“Clare is one of the ladies who gave more than she got,” he added. Thaler said her family of eight children and more than 60 grandchildren and great-grandchildren knew she was “old and at the end of her life line, but to suddenly have it cut short and ruined in such a way is shocking and confronting.” “It’s absurd,” he added.Cotter refused to answer any questions about criminal charges for the officer, but confirmed that he had served 12 years on the force. He added that the officer was “nonoperational at this stage while he is under review.” “Not one of our officers is above the law, and all our actions will be scrutinized robustly from a criminal and departmental perspective,” he said.The investigation was nominated a level 1 incident, which classifies injuries that lead to death or imminent death with exceptional circumstances. The classification ensures the highest level of inquiry with the inclusion of a homicide squad.“Critical incidents are a matter we are always transparent on,” Cotter said.Two police body cameras captured the incident, forming “a significant and integral part of the investigation,” but it will not be released because “it is not in the public interest,” he added. The investigation will be ultimately reviewed by the professional standards command of the South Wales Police Force, Cotter said, with oversight by the Law Enforcement Conduct Commission of New South Wales.Lyme ChoLyme Cho is an intern for NBC News based in London ","{'neg': 0.093, 'neu': 0.86, 'pos': 0.047, 'compound': -0.9908}",-0.9908,"Police taser a 95-year-old woman with dementia in Australia

In July 2021, the company was fined 200,000 yuan for publishing advertisements that featured a comedian endorsing a lingerie brand with comments said to objectify women.Reuter ","{'neg': 0.062, 'neu': 0.792, 'pos': 0.146, 'compound': 0.9925}",0.9925,"A costly joke: China slaps comedy firm with $2 million fine for military gag

McCaul had threatened to hold Blinken in contempt of Congress for not turning over the classified document.""In light of this invitation, I will pause efforts to enforce the Committee’s subpoena pending my review of the documents,"" McCaul wrote. ""Please note, however, that the subpoena remains in full force and effect, and the acceptance of this accommodation does not waive any of the Committee’s rights regarding the subpoena.""He also insisted on ""allowing other Members to review the dissent cable and response.""Rep. Gregory Meeks of New York, the top Democrat on the Foreign Affairs Committee, will be allowed to view the documents with McCaul.The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on McCaul's letter.The State Department has made various counteroffers to McCaul's March subpoena, including providing a written summary of the cable’s contents in addition to a classified briefing. McCaul, however, has insisted that the committee receive a full copy of the cable, as well as Blinken’s response to it.The U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan was widely viewed as chaotic. A deadly attack at Abbey Gate at Kabul International Airport resulted in the deaths of 13 U.S. service members and 170 Afghan civilians.The Biden administration has blown past three deadlines for a congressional subpoena for the dissent cable, arguing that providing the sensitive memo to Congress would deter diplomats from using the channel to voice opposing views.The State Department said Wednesday it would let the top two members of the Foreign Affairs Committee — McCaul and Meeks — view the 2021 cable, according to a letter obtained by NBC News.“The accommodations that the Department has provided to date are extraordinary and, as stated in our prior correspondence, already create a serious risk of chilling both future use of, and future candor in, Dissent Channel cables,” said the letter from the assistant secretary for legislative affairs, Naz Durakoglu, which called the latest proposal “extraordinary.”The letter added that the State Department’s offer was contingent on the committee’s suspending all enforcement actions related to the subpoena, including dropping the threat to hold Blinken in contempt.McCaul on Wednesday called the offer “a significant step forward” but did not drop his contempt threat.Vedant Patel, a State Department spokesperson, defended the department's engagement Thursday.“I think it is natural in these discussions for there to be deliberations and accommodations about the path forward. I’m certainly not going to speculate and hypothesize on how we continue to further engage with the committee,” Patel told reporters. “What I will reiterate, though, is that at every turn we have offered tangible, fair and realistic accommodations that we think have sufficiently met and continue to sufficiently meet the committee’s request for information.”Abigail WilliamsAbigail Williams is a producer and reporter for NBC News covering the State Department.Ryan NoblesKate SantalizKate Santaliz is a researcher for NBC News’ Capitol Hill team.Megan Lebowit ","{'neg': 0.03, 'neu': 0.91, 'pos': 0.06, 'compound': 0.9623}",0.9623,"GOP lawmaker hits pause on enforcing subpoena for 2021 Afghanistan cable

Those include publications about the bloody crackdown and others written by pro-democracy politicians and political commentators.Hong Kong is a former British colony that returned to China’s rule in 1997, promising to retain its Western-style freedoms. But the city’s cultural and creative sectors said the city’s freedoms have shrunk since Beijing imposed a tough national security law following massive pro-democracy protests in 2019.Critics said the book pulling would further undermine Hong Kong’s reputation for having free access to information and freedom of expression.But Lee defended the sweeping law at the legislature, saying Hong Kong’s freedoms are protected by the city’s constitution.“The books we offer for residents to borrow are those that we recommend,” he said. “We would never recommend books that are illegal and violate copyrights. We would never recommend those that we deem to be featuring bad ideologies.”He said residents could still find such books to read elsewhere. He did not elaborate on what was considered “bad ideologies” and why the books were removed.Asked why the books were removed, the Leisure and Cultural Services Department said public libraries review and withdraw materials that do not conform to “the collection development” from time to time. If any material is suspected of being contrary to the interests of national security or violating laws, the libraries will immediately suspend services of the material in question for review, it said.The removal of the books was reported by local media outlets after a Chinese newspaper stopped publishing works by the city’s most prominent political cartoonist on Sunday following government complaints. Comic strip collections by the cartoonist were also no longer available in public libraries.Political scholar Ivan Choy said one book he co-authored was pulled despite a previous endorsement by former Secretary for Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Stephen Lam. Lam wrote the foreword for the title and said it was the most comprehensive book on the city’s electoral system, Choy said.“We wrote this book as academics and are not trying to make any political statements. So I feel they have overreacted,” he said.After the books were pulled and the publication of political cartoons halted, Choy questioned how Hong Kong could still stay as an international metropolitan without being broad-minded and inclusive. He added China wants Hong Kong to become an international cultural exchange center, where the East meets the West.He said the changes keep Hong Kong from living up to its reputation.Since a sweeping security law was enacted in 2020, the city’s art and media communities have learned to be wary of crossing vaguely defined red lines in producing art and other content that might be perceived as challenging the Chinese Communist Party’s control.The group that organized Hong Kong’s annual vigil in remembrance of the Tiananmen Square crackdown also voted to disband in 2021 under the shadow of the security law. The annual vigil was the only large-scale public commemoration of the event on Chinese soil and was attended by massive crowds until authorities banned it in 2020, citing anti-pandemic measures.Supporters say the group’s closure shows that the freedoms and autonomy promised when Hong Kong returned to China in 1997 are diminishing.This year, a massive vigil is unlikely to take place in its usual spot, Victoria Park in Causeway Bay, on June 4. Instead, some pro-Beijing groups will host a bazaar to celebrate the city’s handover to Chinese rule there.Associated Pres ","{'neg': 0.073, 'neu': 0.841, 'pos': 0.086, 'compound': 0.894}",0.894,"Hong Kong leader defends removing politically sensitive books from public libraries

Last week, Khan supporters had attacked public property and military installations after he was dragged out of a courtroom and detained.The popular opposition leader was released over the weekend and returned to his home in an upscale district of Lahore, Pakistan’s second largest city and the capital of the Punjab region.On Wednesday, Khan took to Twitter after 200 police officers surrounded the house, and a prison van appeared on the scene.“Probably my last tweet before my next arrest,” Khan tweeted. “ Police have surrounded my house.”Earlier on Wednesday, Amir Mir, a spokesman for the Punjab provincial government, said Khan has 24 hours to hand over 40 suspects allegedly hiding at his home or face a police raid. Mir told a news conference that so far 3,400 suspects have been arrested and that more raids are planned.Pakistani authorities have said they would prosecute civilians involved in recent anti-government protests in military courts.K.M. Chaudary / APPakistani authorities have said they would prosecute civilians involved in recent anti-government protests in military courts. The army chief, Gen. Asim Munir, said in a speech to troops Wednesday that “recently planned and orchestrated tragic incidents will never be allowed again at any cost.”The advocacy group Amnesty International and the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan said they were alarmed by the government’s plan.Dinushika Dissanayake, Amnesty’s deputy regional director for South Asia, said that trying civilians in military courts is contrary to international law.Military trials in Pakistan are usually held behind closed doors, depriving civilians of some of their basic rights, including contracting a lawyer of their choice.A wave of violence had engulfed Pakistan’s capital and other urban areas following Khan’s dramatic arrest from a courtroom. Khan supporters torched buildings and vehicles and attacked police and military personnel and facilities. Ten people were killed in the clashes, and more than 4,000 were arrested.The Supreme Court later ordered Khan’s release and criticized the way he was arrested.On Wednesday, a top court in Islamabad extended Khan’s bail and protection from arrest until the end of the month. However, his legal team fears he might be arrested in old cases.Imran Khan granted bail, leaves high court amid tight securityMay 12, 202300:47Khan, 70, was ousted by a non-confidence vote in parliament last year. He is currently facing more than 100 cases, mainly on charges of inciting people to violence, threatening officials, and defying a ban on rallies. He also faces a graft case along with his wife.In recent days, the government of Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif has accused Khan of sheltering suspects linked to last week’s attacks.Khan, meanwhile, alleged some of his supporters were being tortured in police custody and demanded the immediate release of female detainees.

But this is not a choice we are in a position to make. Because China has already embarked on a self-reliance drive, whether we want to decouple from their economy or not,” Truss said in an address to the Prospect Foundation at a hotel in the Taiwanese capital, Taipei.“China is growing its navy at an alarming rate and is undertaking the biggest military build-up in peacetime history,” she said.“They have already formed alliances with other nations that want to see the free world in decline. They have already made a choice about their strategy. The only choice we have is whether we appease and accommodate — or we take action to prevent conflict,” Truss said.Elsewhere, Truss praised her successor, Rishi Sunak, for describing China as “the biggest long-term threat to Britain” in comments last summer and for urging the closure of Chinese government-run cultural centers known as Confucius Institutes, which have been criticized as outlets for Communist Party propaganda. Such services could instead be provided by people from Taiwan and Hong Kong who come to the United Kingdom of their own volition.In Beijing, spokesperson for the Cabinet’s Taiwan Affairs Office Mao Xiaoguang accused Taiwan’s ruling Democratic Progressive Party of “spending the tax money of the Taiwanese people to bribe some anti-China politicians who have stepped down from office to stage a farce of seeking external support for independence in Taiwan.”Liz Truss with Taiwan Foreign Minister Joseph Wu upon her arrival at the Taoyuan airport Tuesday.APMa also renewed China’s military threats against Taiwan, a day after the Chinese Defense Ministry condemned U.S. military assistance to the island.“If they continue to challenge and force us, we will have to take decisive measures to defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity,” Ma told reporters at a biweekly news conference. “No one should underestimate our strong determination, unwavering will and strong ability.”Next year is seen by some as a crucial period for tense relations between the sides, with U.S. and Taiwanese voters going to the polls. Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen has served the maximum two terms and Vice President Lai Ching-te, a strong independence supporter, will be running for the DPP.Meanwhile, the main opposition Nationalist Party, or Kuomintang, on Wednesday nominated local politician Hou Yu-ih as its candidate in the January election. Hou rose to prominence as a top police official but has relatively little experience dealing with China and Taiwan’s international partners.Taiwan will also elect a new legislature, which is currently controlled by the ruling party.China’s relations with Britain and most other Western democracies have been in steep decline in recent years, largely as a result of disputes over human rights, trade technology and China’s aggressive moves toward Taiwan and in the South China Sea.Beijing’s relations with London have been especially bitter over China’s sweeping crackdown on free speech, democracy and other civil liberties in Hong Kong, a former British colony that was promised it would retain its freedoms after the handover to Chinese rule in 1997.China has said a key previous bilateral agreement on Hong Kong no longer applies and has rejected British expressions of concern as interference in China’s domestic political affairs. China has also been angered by a joint Australian-U.S.-British agreement known as AUKUS that would provide Australia with nuclear-powered submarines in part to counter the perceived rising threat from China.Truss, who served an ill-fated seven weeks as prime minister last year, also said China could not be trusted to follow through on its commitments in areas from trade to protection of the environment.And she praised Taiwan as “an enduring rebuke to totalitarianism” whose fate was a “core interest” to Europe.“A blockade or invasion of Taiwan would undermine freedom and democracy in Europe. Just as a Russian victory in Ukraine would undermine freedom and democracy in the Pacific,” Truss said.“We in the United Kingdom and the free world must do all we can to back you,” she said.Truss’ remarks also stood in stark contrast to published comments from French President Emmanuel Macron last month that elicited doubts about whether Macron’s views were in line with other European countries on Taiwan’s status.“The question we need to answer, as Europeans, is the following: Is it in our interest to accelerate (a crisis) on Taiwan? No,” Macron was quoted as saying in the interview. “The worst thing would be to think that we Europeans must become followers on this topic and take our cue from the U.S. agenda and a Chinese overreaction.”Shortly afterward, Macron denied any change on France’s views toward Taiwan, saying, “We are for the status quo, and this policy is constant.”Associated Pres ","{'neg': 0.088, 'neu': 0.799, 'pos': 0.113, 'compound': 0.9853}",0.9853,"Former British Prime Minister Liz Truss warns of China threats during Taiwan visit

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan at a rally in Sivas earlier this week.Muhammed Selim Korkutata / Anadolu Agency via Getty ImagesPrintMay 28, 2023, 10:22 AM UTCBy Matt Bradley, Paul Goldman and Leila SackurANKARA, Turkey — It’s one of the most hotly contested presidential elections in recent times, but at the Arjantin İlkokulu elementary school in Turkey’s capital Ankara, the mood was quiet, orderly and calm. There was no pushing and shoving as voters waited in short lines to decide whether the country’s long-time leader Recep Tayyip Erdoğan stretches his rule into a third decade or is unseated by challenger Kemal Kilicdaroglu, who has promised to restore a more democratic society. Continuity or change? “I hope it will be good for Turkey,” said geologist Salami Toprak, 67, shortly after he voted. “Let’s see what’s gonna come out.” He added that he was thinking about the next generation as he cast his ballot.  Closely watched from Washington and Kyiv to Moscow and Beijing, the runoff in the Turkish Republic’s centenary year, come s after neither candidate was able to secure more than 50% of the votes in the first ballot on May 14, Erdoğan falling short by a miniscule amount.Kilicdaroglu, 74, has described the run-off as a referendum on the country’s future. The leader of the secular, center-left Republican People’s Party, or CHP, since 2010 is a starkly different figure from Erdoğan, who is known for his bombastic speeches. Softly spoken, he has a reputation as a bridge builder. As well as returning the country to a parliamentary democracy, Kilicdaroglu and the alliance have promised to establish the independence of the judiciary and the central bank, institute checks and balances and reverse the democratic backsliding and crackdowns on free speech and dissent. Ballot papers for the Turkish presidential election at the Arjantin İlkokulu elementary in Turkey's capital Ankara. Paul Goldman / NBC NewsBut Erdoğan is favored to win, after his ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) retained a majority in parliament in the elections earlier this month.  Initially however, he had trailed in opinion polls during a campaign dominated by the fallout from the devastating earthquake that left over 50,000 dead earlier this year and the country’s economic turmoil. Erdoğan increased wages and pensions ahead of the election’s first round, and subsidized electricity costs and gas bills in an attempt to woo voters who have faced a steep cost-of-living and currency crisis precipitated by numerous rate cuts by the government in an attempt to boost exports. Immigration has also been high on the agenda and both candidates have sought to bolster their nationalist credentials ahead of the runoff.Ahead of the first vote, Kilicdaroglu said he intended to repatriate refugees within two years by creating favorable conditions for their return. But he has since toughened his stance and vowed to send all refugees home once he was elected president.Erdoğan, meanwhile, courted and won the backing of the nationalist politician Sinan Ogan, the former academic who was backed for president by an anti-migrant party but was eliminated after finishing third in the first round of voting. On the campaign trail, Ogan said he would consider sending migrants back by force if necessary.   While the economy and migration were important issues, “Erdoğan managed to securitize the elections and convinced his base that national security was at stake,” said Dimitar Bechev, a lecturer on Turkey, Oxford University in the U.K., author of “Turkey under Erdoğan.” He added that “identity politics revolving around ethnicity and religion” had determined much of the allocation of the votes. Turkey presidential elections head to runoffMay 16, 202302:41The results will also have myriad ramifications outside Turkey, which enjoys a strategic location at the crossroads of Europe and Asia. Turkey boasts NATO’s second largest armed forces after the U.S., it controls the crucial Bosporus Strait, and it is widely believed to host U.S. nuclear missiles on its soil. Despite being a NATO member, the country has maintained close ties with Russia and has blocked Sweden’s membership of the Western military alliance. An Erdoğan win would likely deepen the country’s relationship with Moscow, according to Nilgun Arisan Eralp, the director at the Center for E.U. studies at the Economic Policy Research Institute of Turkey in Ankara. “Given the dire straits the economy is in, Russian money will be needed for the regime to continue,” Eralp said, adding that it was likely he would continue to reject Swedish membership of NATO, damaging relations with the United States and drawing the country closer to the Kremlin.Ankara has long accused Sweden of harboring militants from the banned Kurdistan Workers Party, which is a designated terrorist group in Turkey, Sweden, and the United States. Ahead of the vote, Ergun Yayla, a taxi driver from Istanbul  said Saturday that he planned to vote for Erdogan. “I think a political change might be good in our country, but as there is nobody else that I think who is honest and who could be successful,” said Yayla, 55. “The opposition is very weak and they will never win.” Matt Bradley and Paul Goldman reported from Ankara.

Ukrainian soldiers on a tank ride along the road toward their positions near Bakhmut on Tuesday.Efrem Lukatsky / APPrintMay 27, 2023, 11:44 AM UTCBy Molly Hunter and Leila SackurKYIV, Ukraine — Ukraine has entered “a new phase of the war,” a senior adviser to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told NBC News Saturday as speculation about its long-anticipated counteroffensive ratcheted up. “Now we see the intensifying attacks on the Russian rear supplies,” said Mykhailo Podolyak, adding that preparations were taking place to strike back at the Kremlin's forces. “We are preparing the battlefield for the new phase of the war. It’s going on now. It is a large number of measures in different sectors of the front line,” he said, conceding that preparation was well underway.During the interview, Podolyak also praised a slickly produced video posted on Telegram Saturday by Valerii Zaluzhnyi, the commander in chief of Ukraine's armed forces.

It’s going on now. It is a large number of measures in different sectors of the front line,” he said, conceding that preparation was well underway.During the interview, Podolyak also praised a slickly produced video posted on Telegram Saturday by Valerii Zaluzhnyi, the commander in chief of Ukraine's armed forces.  It showed Ukrainian troops training, swearing an oath and preparing for battle, alongside the caption “The time has come to return what is ours.” If Ukraine’s top general is suggesting that, he’ll have a good reason, Podolyak said, calling it “very good.”  He added that it showed “that Ukraine maybe almost ready to start a big operation aimed at the liberation of its territories.” His comments followed his tweet the other day which said the counteroffensive was “not a ‘single event’ that will begin at a specific hour of a specific day with a solemn cutting of the red ribbon.”Meanwhile, at the scene of some of the war’s heaviest fighting in the besieged eastern city of Bakhmut, Ukraine’s deputy defense minister said Saturday that Russian attacks had “decreased.” “Yesterday and today there are no active battles there — neither in the city, nor on the flanks,” Hanna Maliar said in a Telegram post.  “Instead, the enemy is actively shelling the outskirts of the city.”  After an intense monthslong battle for the city that came to embody Ukrainian resistance, the Kremlin declared full control of the city last week after months of fighting not seen in Europe since World War II.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan at a rally in Sivas earlier this week.Muhammed Selim Korkutata / Anadolu Agency via Getty ImagesPrintMay 28, 2023, 10:22 AM UTCBy Matt Bradley, Paul Goldman and Leila SackurANKARA, Turkey — It’s one of the most hotly contested presidential elections in recent times, but at the Arjantin İlkokulu elementary school in Turkey’s capital Ankara, the mood was quiet, orderly and calm. There was no pushing and shoving as voters waited in short lines to decide whether the country’s long-time leader Recep Tayyip Erdoğan stretches his rule into a third decade or is unseated by challenger Kemal Kilicdaroglu, who has promised to restore a more democratic society. Continuity or change? “I hope it will be good for Turkey,” said geologist Salami Toprak, 67, shortly after he voted. “Let’s see what’s gonna come out.” He added that he was thinking about the next generation as he cast his ballot.  Closely watched from Washington and Kyiv to Moscow and Beijing, the runoff in the Turkish Republic’s centenary year, come s after neither candidate was able to secure more than 50% of the votes in the first ballot on May 14, Erdoğan falling short by a miniscule amount.Kilicdaroglu, 74, has described the run-off as a referendum on the country’s future. The leader of the secular, center-left Republican People’s Party, or CHP, since 2010 is a starkly different figure from Erdoğan, who is known for his bombastic speeches. Softly spoken, he has a reputation as a bridge builder. As well as returning the country to a parliamentary democracy, Kilicdaroglu and the alliance have promised to establish the independence of the judiciary and the central bank, institute checks and balances and reverse the democratic backsliding and crackdowns on free speech and dissent. Ballot papers for the Turkish presidential election at the Arjantin İlkokulu elementary in Turkey's capital Ankara. Paul Goldman / NBC NewsBut Erdoğan is favored to win, after his ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) retained a majority in parliament in the elections earlier this month.  Initially however, he had trailed in opinion polls during a campaign dominated by the fallout from the devastating earthquake that left over 50,000 dead earlier this year and the country’s economic turmoil. Erdoğan increased wages and pensions ahead of the election’s first round, and subsidized electricity costs and gas bills in an attempt to woo voters who have faced a steep cost-of-living and currency crisis precipitated by numerous rate cuts by the government in an attempt to boost exports. Immigration has also been high on the agenda and both candidates have sought to bolster their nationalist credentials ahead of the runoff.Ahead of the first vote, Kilicdaroglu said he intended to repatriate refugees within two years by creating favorable conditions for their return. But he has since toughened his stance and vowed to send all refugees home once he was elected president.Erdoğan, meanwhile, courted and won the backing of the nationalist politician Sinan Ogan, the former academic who was backed for president by an anti-migrant party but was eliminated after finishing third in the first round of voting. On the campaign trail, Ogan said he would consider sending migrants back by force if necessary.   While the economy and migration were important issues, “Erdoğan managed to securitize the elections and convinced his base that national security was at stake,” said Dimitar Bechev, a lecturer on Turkey, Oxford University in the U.K., author of “Turkey under Erdoğan.” He added that “identity politics revolving around ethnicity and religion” had determined much of the allocation of the votes. Turkey presidential elections head to runoffMay 16, 202302:41The results will also have myriad ramifications outside Turkey, which enjoys a strategic location at the crossroads of Europe and Asia. Turkey boasts NATO’s second largest armed forces after the U.S., it controls the crucial Bosporus Strait, and it is widely believed to host U.S. nuclear missiles on its soil. Despite being a NATO member, the country has maintained close ties with Russia and has blocked Sweden’s membership of the Western military alliance. An Erdoğan win would likely deepen the country’s relationship with Moscow, according to Nilgun Arisan Eralp, the director at the Center for E.U. studies at the Economic Policy Research Institute of Turkey in Ankara. “Given the dire straits the economy is in, Russian money will be needed for the regime to continue,” Eralp said, adding that it was likely he would continue to reject Swedish membership of NATO, damaging relations with the United States and drawing the country closer to the Kremlin.Ankara has long accused Sweden of harboring militants from the banned Kurdistan Workers Party, which is a designated terrorist group in Turkey, Sweden, and the United States. Ahead of the vote, Ergun Yayla, a taxi driver from Istanbul  said Saturday that he planned to vote for Erdogan. “I think a political change might be good in our country, but as there is nobody else that I think who is honest and who could be successful,” said Yayla, 55. “The opposition is very weak and they will never win.” Matt Bradley and Paul Goldman reported from Ankara.

Amr Nabil / APPrintMay 27, 2023, 3:39 PM UTCBy Charlene Gubash and Leila SackurSAQQARA, Egypt — Ancient workshops and tombs dating back 4,000 years were unveiled by antiquities authorities Saturday, at a sprawling pharaonic necropolis outside Cairo, Egypt's capital. Clay pots and other items apparently used to mummify humans and sacred animals were also found at the site in Saqqara, which is a part of Egypt’s ancient capital of Memphis, Mostafa Waziri, secretary-general of the Supreme Council of Antiquities, told reporters. “We discovered the biggest embalming — we call it house — or workshop, one for humans and one for animals,” Waziri said at a news conference at the UNESCO World Heritage site.He said they had also discovered tombs dating back to the fifth dynasty 4,400 years ago, which were decorated with “daily life scenes and another life scenes” and images of harvest and cultivation.  Visitors tour the site in the Saqqara necropolis in Egypt, on Saturday.Khaled Desouki / AFP via Getty ImagesThe workshops and tombs date back to the 30th pharaonic dynasty (380 B.C. to 343 B.C.) and to the Ptolemaic period (305 B.C. to 30 B.C.), he said.The animal embalming workshop was made with mud and stone floors, and was discovered alongside bronze tools that would have been used in the mummification process. Five beds made out of stone were discovered still standing inside the room, which would have been used to mummify the most sacred animals. One of the tombs belonged to “Ne Hesut Ba,” who was the head of scribes and the priest of Horus and Maat during the the fifth dynasty in around 2400 B.C., Sabri Farag, head of the Saqqara archaeological site, said in a separate news release.The workshops and tombs date back to the 30th pharaonic dynasty (380 B.C. to 343 B.C.) and to the Ptolemaic period (305 B.C. to 30 B.C.),Khaled Desouki / AFP via Getty ImagesThe second tomb belonged to a Qadish priest named “Men Kheber” from the 18th dynasty (around  1400 B.C.), he said. Old Kingdom tombs for humans were discovered painted with the names of the dead and their wives. Inside the New Kingdom tombs, which date back to the 1500s B.C., alabaster statues of the tombs' owners were discovered still intact inside, with hieroglyphic text in blue. In February, the discovery of an unusual set of ceramic vessels at the Saqqara necropolis shed light on how ancient Egyptians mummified bodies.Old Kingdom tombs for humans were discovered painted with the names of the dead and their wives. Khaled Desouki / AFP via Getty ImagesChemical residue found in the jars allowed researchers to identify mixtures of fragrant or antiseptic oils, tars and resins, according to the study. This, matched with writing inscribed on the exterior of the containers, provided researchers with new details about specific materials used in mummification, such as dammar tree resin and elemi oil, which are native to rainforests in Asia and Africa.In recent years, Egypt‘s government has heavily promoted new archaeological finds to international media and diplomats. It hopes that such discoveries will help attract more tourists to the country to revive an industry that suffered from political turmoil following the 2011 uprising.Charlene Gubash reported from Saqqara and Leila Sackur from London.Charlene GubashCharlene Gubash is an NBC News producer based in Cairo.

Sources: Tentative agreement reached on debt limit deal01:49PrintSaveCreate your free profile or log in to save this articleSavedUnsavedMay 28, 2023, 12:55 AM UTC / Updated May 28, 2023, 1:19 AM UTCBy Sahil Kapur, Katherine Doyle, Julie Tsirkin and Liz Brown-KaiserWASHINGTON — Key negotiators struck an agreement in principle Saturday night to extend the debt ceiling and avert a catastrophic default, just days before the Treasury Department says the U.S. could run out of money, Speaker Kevin McCarthy said Saturday.The deal — which is expected to raise the country's borrowing authority in exchange for cuts to spending — still has to be converted into legislative language and pass both the Republican-led House and Democratic-controlled Senate. It follows weeks of negotiations led by President Joe Biden and Speaker Kevin McCarthy, amid demands by the GOP to extract spending cuts in exchange for allowing the nation to continue to pay the bills.McCarthy says House will vote on Wednesday to raise the debt ceilingMay 28, 202301:12""We’ve come to an agreement in principle that is worthy of the American people,"" McCarthy said Saturday on Twitter.""We still have more work to do tonight to finish all the writing of it,"" McCarthy told reporters afterward outside his Capitol office, adding that he expects to post the text on Sunday and hold a House vote on it Wednesday.He added that he'll speak to Biden again on Sunday.A source familiar with the agreement said it includes a two-year appropriations deal and a two-year debt limit extension, effectively resolving the issue until after the 2024 election. It'll include work requirements for federal aid like SNAP for Americans up to 54, with exceptions for homeless people and veterans. But there will be ""no changes to Medicaid,"" the source added.By averting the crisis, the White House would be sidestepping a first-ever default that threatens to wipe out millions of jobs and devastate the American economy, rocking faith in Biden's leadership  — and the divided Congress — as he embarks on a reelection bid.Biden and McCarthy spent an hour and a half on a call Saturday night, a rare one-on-one conversation between the two leaders that followed days of fraught talks over the final sticking points.Top Republicans had been in and out of the speaker's office on Saturday as negotiations continued, with some of the talks taking place virtually and by phone. Shalanda Young, a top negotiator for the White House, was in Louisiana to deliver graduation remarks at Xavier University where she quipped that the two-hour break was ""the most fun I’ve had in two weeks.”Republican leaders began preparing to sell a bill to the GOP conference late Friday with a deal still out of reach.Conservatives skeptical of Republican leadership had threatened to hold up the bill if the speaker struck a deal with Democrats that failed to slash spending, with one outside adviser warning of coming “trench warfare.”McCarthy has said in recent days he'll give members 72 hours to review the text before holding a floor vote. And Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, has threatened to block a speedy vote in the Senate if he isn't satisfied with the terms of the deal, meaning it could take days for the chamber to jump through procedural hoops before a vote.Extending the debt ceiling doesn’t authorize new spending into the future; it enables the U.S. to pay existing debts that both parties have accumulated over many years through demands for higher spending on domestic and military programs, as well as lower taxes.Negotiating staff for McCarthy and the White House held back-to-back negotiating sessions, some stretching late into the night before resuming again. The Republican push to add work requirements to social safety net programs remained an obstacle until the final moment. By the time a deal was announced Saturday, Democratic angst was reduced to a low simmer. Biden's low profile in the talks had drawn consternation from some members of his party who feared the president was ceding the messaging war to Republicans. Calls for Biden to use the bully pulpit of his office took on a fevered pitch as some worried about the need to sell a bill with deep concessions to voters next year. Vice President Kamala Harris, who had entered the talks publicly one week earlier before helming a glitchy Zoom call, had also kept a low profile.As anxiety mounted, so did pressure on Biden not to turn away from options to tackle the debt unilaterally such as the 14th Amendment. “The only option right now is for Congress to do their jobs without conditions,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said. On Friday, Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo ruled it out with a firm “no.”Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen set a June 5 deadline for when the government was expected to blow through the debt limit, heightening pressure in the final days.

He’s got a demanding day job. And he was never the world’s most electric campaigner to begin with. To win re-election, President Joe Biden is planning to tap an expansive stable of friends and allies to go where he can’t, say what he won’t, and be what he’ll never be.Campaign surrogates are nothing new. William McKinley deployed 1,400 while campaigning for the White House in 1896 while he mostly greeted supporters from the front porch of his home in Ohio.But Biden’s nascent re-election campaign has invested early — before it even has a headquarters and ahead of what former President Barack Obama did in 2012 — in what veteran operatives say is an unusually robust operation to tap the star power of the Democratic Party, most of which resides outside the White House.“President Biden, as he has proven this week, is very busy being president,” said Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., a campaign co-chair who was one of several surrogates who made themselves available to cable news bookers and other journalists while Biden was overseas last week. “Our president has assembled a group that includes some truly promising up-and-coming leaders from across the country.”At their best, campaign surrogates are a win-win: The campaign gets force multipliers, validators and access to their grassroots networks. The surrogates, meanwhile, get important entrees, a bit of spotlight, and some chits to cash. But surrogates also have their own interests and proclivities and — a well-documented tendency to go off-script. And an over-reliance on them could open Biden to criticism that he’s reprising the so-called “basement campaign” of 2020 because he’s unable or unwilling to hit the stump himself. (Former President Donald Trump frequently taunted Biden for not being out campaigning more.) “Part of a re-election campaign means that the president is actively governing as president. That’s the reality. So I think smartly addressing the reality means you have to leverage the networks and other voices in the party,” said a source familiar with the campaign’s planning, granted anonymity to discuss the inner workings.The campaign said it has already coordinated over 185 interviews in a wide range of national and local media, in both English and Spanish, a broad spectrum multi-platform approach that they hope will help the message breakthrough in a fractured media landscape.The campaign’s core surrogates — its six co-chairs and the 50 members of its National Advisory Board, plus Vice President Kamala Harris — were chosen not just for loyalty or stature or political needs, but because they all agreed to be available and do the work.“We anticipate being very active,” said Rep. Maxwell Frost, D-Fla., the 26-year-old progressive freshman who is a rising star on the left. “It’s definitely more than a list of 50 names. I think the president really wants to put together a list of people who are ready to work.”That will mean appearing at fundraisers and in-person events, participating in media interviews, posting on social media, and tapping their own local support networks. Administration officials and many others will be included too, such as when Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg appeared at a recent Biden fundraiser in New York.Jim Messina, who ran Obama’s re-election campaign, said surrogates are critical to fundraising efforts and as outside validators for an electorate increasingly cynical about politics. And the sheer number of media and social media platforms these days means the campaign needs lots of help to reach them all, he said. “What is true, and this was not true 10 years ago, is you can’t just recycle the usual talking points. That won’t go viral, it won’t break through. So you need people that can speak in their own voice,” Messina said. “Will it work every time? No. Will there be times when someone says something you wish they hadn’t put it exactly that way, of course. But overall, this will be more real and authentic.” Frost is one of several members of Biden’s advisory board who come from a different ideological wing of the party or have even criticized him at times, along with familiar names like Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass and Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif.“I still think he’s our best bet in Pennsylvania, in Michigan, in Wisconsin to win those states,” Khanna, who has been traveling to Iowa and New Hampshire as he eyes a potential future presidential bid, said of Biden on NBC News' ""Meet the Press"" last month.Also on the list are the two Democratic officials who seemed closest to considering a primary challenge to Biden last year, California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, in keeping with a Lyndon Johnson-style philosophy of keeping frenemies close. The list also includes potential future presidential candidates, like Govs. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania and Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan.“He’s making a very concerted effort to bring everyone in,” said Chris Huntley, a Democratic speechwriter and strategist. “There’s nothing wrong with getting together the Avengers of surrogates, who all have different powers and different abilities...showcasing the present and future of our party.”Four years ago, Republicans mocked and Democrats fretted about Biden’s pandemic-era “basement campaign,” when the candidate largely eschewed in-person events in favor of Zoom meetings and recorded video messages. And he would hardly be the first incumbent president to wage a so-called “Rose Garden campaign” that focuses more on governing from the White House than barnstorming in a swing state. Of course, Biden’s low-profile campaign won in 2020 and most presidents get re-elected, with the most recent exception, Trump, being the incumbent who campaigned the most. Biden’s heavy reliance on surrogates is sure to face similar criticism this time around, especially as Trump and other conservatives argue Biden lacks the physical and mental vitality for the job. But allies say the president should try to stay about the fray of the campaign and leave the messier work of responding to Trump and other Republicans to them.“I think you will see a real team effort to support the president and to be able to convey his message out into the world, so everything doesn’t rely on him alone,” Jeffrey Katzenberg, the Hollywood mogul and Democratic mega-donor who is also a Biden campaign co-chair said in an interview. “I think that’s the most important thing that he can do in terms of his candidacy for reelection — do what you’ve been doing. As opposed to the person who last occupied the White House.”Still, relying on others to do the work for you has its limitations, which was underscored this month when New York City Mayor Eric Adams was not added to the Biden advisory committee after criticizing the White House’s handling of migrants, though the campaign says he remains a supporter and is still considered a surrogate.And surrogates, especially political ones, sometimes come with their own parochial demands. For instance, Georgia Democrat Stacey Abrams told the Biden campaign in 2020 she would only agree to be a surrogate if they agreed to invest millions to try to win her state, according to her former campaign manager. Frost said he’s been lobbying to make sure Florida remains a priority for the campaign, even as some Democrats say Biden should write off the extremely expensive state that has sided with Republicans in recent years. “If you look at the numbers, Florida is a state you don’t want to give up,” he said. “I’ve made that case and I’ve been reassured by many people.”He’s happy to get a chance to make that case, even if it means talking constantly about Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, who just entered the presidential race. “I already talk about DeSantis about every day, and I anticipate that will continue,” Frost said.

Final removal would require a two-thirds vote in the Senate.Texas House votes to impeach Attorney General Ken Paxton03:55PrintMay 27, 2023, 4:38 PM UTC / Updated May 28, 2023, 12:01 AM UTC / Source: Associated PressBy The Associated PressAUSTIN — Texas’ Republican-led House of Representatives impeached state Attorney General Ken Paxton on Saturday on articles including bribery and abuse of public trust, a sudden, historic rebuke of a GOP official who rose to be a star of the conservative legal movement despite years of scandal and alleged crimes.Impeachment triggers Paxton’s immediate suspension from office pending the outcome of a trial in the state Senate and empowers Republican Gov. Greg Abbott to appoint someone else as Texas’ top lawyer in the interim.The 121-23 vote constitutes an abrupt downfall for one of the GOP’s most prominent legal combatants, who in 2020 asked the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn President Joe Biden’s electoral defeat of Donald Trump. It makes Paxton only the third sitting official in Texas’ nearly 200-year history to have been impeached.Paxton, 60, decried the move moments after scores of his fellow partisans voted for impeachment, and his office pointed to internal reports that found no wrongdoing.“The ugly spectacle in the Texas House today confirmed the outrageous impeachment plot against me was never meant to be fair or just,” Paxton said. “It was a politically motivated sham from the beginning.”Paxton has been under FBI investigation for years over accusations that he used his office to help a donor and was separately indicted on securities fraud charges in 2015, though he has yet to stand trial. His party had long taken a muted stance on the allegations — but that changed this week as 60 of the House’s 85 Republicans, including Speaker Dade Phelan, voted to impeach.“No one person should be above the law, least not the top law officer of the state of Texas,” Rep. David Spiller, a Republican member of the committee that investigated Paxton, said in opening statements. Another Republican committee member, Rep. Charlie Geren, said without elaborating that Paxton had called some lawmakers before the vote and threatened them with political “consequences.”Lawmakers allied with Paxton tried to discredit the investigation by noting that hired investigators, not panel members, interviewed witnesses. They also said several of the investigators had voted in Democratic primaries, tainting the impeachment, and that they had too little time to review evidence.“I perceive it could be political weaponization,” Rep. Tony Tinderholt, one of the House’s most conservative members, said before the vote. Republican Rep. John Smithee compared the proceeding to “a Saturday mob out for an afternoon lynching.”Texas state Attorney General Ken Paxton speaks at his office in Austin, Texas, on Friday.Eric Gay / APPaxton has been under FBI investigation for years over accusations that he used his office to help a donor and was separately indicted on securities fraud charges in 2015, though he has yet to stand trial.

Tony Tinderholt, one of the House’s most conservative members, said before the vote. Republican Rep. John Smithee compared the proceeding to “a Saturday mob out for an afternoon lynching.”The voting board is lit with a majority of green lights as the house votes to impeach Attorney General Ken Paxton in the House Chamber at the Texas Capitol in Austin on Saturday.Eric Gay / APPaxton is automatically suspended from office pending the Senate trial. Final removal would require a two-thirds vote in the Senate, where Paxton’s wife’s, Angela, is a member.Representatives of the governor, who lauded Paxton while swearing him in for a third term in January, did not immediately respond to requests for comment on a temporary replacement.Before the vote Saturday, Trump and U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz came to Paxton’s defense, with the senator calling the impeachment process “a travesty” and saying the attorney general’s legal troubles should be left to the courts.“Free Ken Paxton,” Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social, warning that if House Republicans proceeded with impeachment, “I will fight you.”In one sense, Paxton’s political peril arrived with dizzying speed: The House committee’s investigation came to light Tuesday, and by Thursday lawmakers issued 20 articles of impeachment.But to Paxton’s detractors, the rebuke was years overdue.In 2014, he admitted to violating Texas securities law, and a year later he was indicted on securities fraud charges in his hometown near Dallas, accused of defrauding investors in a tech startup. He pleaded not guilty to two felony counts carrying a potential sentence of five to 99 years.He opened a legal defense fund and accepted $100,000 from an executive whose company was under investigation by Paxton’s office for Medicaid fraud. An additional $50,000 was donated by an Arizona retiree whose son Paxton later hired to a high-ranking job but was soon fired after displaying child pornography in a meeting. In 2020, Paxton intervened in a Colorado mountain community where a Texas donor and college classmate faced removal from his lakeside home under coronavirus orders.But what ultimately unleashed the impeachment push was Paxton’s relationship with Austin real estate developer Nate Paul.Texas House to vote on impeachment of AG Ken PaxtonMay 26, 202304:04In 2020, eight top aides told the FBI they were concerned Paxton was misusing his office to help Paul over the developer’s unproven claims that an elaborate conspiracy to steal $200 million of his properties was afoot. The FBI searched Paul’s home in 2019, but he has not been charged and denies wrongdoing. Paxton also told staff members he had an affair with a woman who, it later emerged, worked for Paul.The impeachment accuses Paxton of attempting to interfere in foreclosure lawsuits and issuing legal opinions to benefit Paul. Its bribery charges allege that Paul employed the woman with whom Paxton had an affair in exchange for legal help and that he paid for expensive renovations to the attorney general’s home.A senior lawyer for Paxton’s office, Chris Hilton, said Friday that the attorney general paid for all repairs and renovations.Other charges, including lying to investigators, date back to Paxton’s still-pending securities fraud indictment.Four of the aides who reported Paxton to the FBI later sued under Texas’ whistleblower law, and in February he agreed to settle the case for $3.3 million. The House committee said it was Paxton seeking legislative approval for the payout that sparked their probe.“But for Paxton’s own request for a taxpayer-funded settlement over his wrongful conduct, Paxton would not be facing impeachment,” the panel said.The Associated Pres ","{'neg': 0.084, 'neu': 0.855, 'pos': 0.061, 'compound': -0.9931}",-0.9931,"Texas House votes to impeach Attorney General Ken Paxton, triggering suspension</span></a><span class=""""></span></h2>]

The supposed strong force failed at every step, they lost hundreds of thousands of soldiers, they lost huge amounts of equipment.“As he said Ukraine is a small country compared to Russia and they are being decimated by this small country.“It is difficult watching that interview because everything he said is a lie.

He said he had not been treated differently from any other prisoner, and it is the court’s judgement.On the subject of jailed westerners in Russia, Kelin claims that Evan Gerschkovich was arrested as a spy.2h ago04.42 EDTThe Kremlin’s man in London, Andrei Kelin, has spoken to the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg on Sunday morning about the war in Ukraine.He said that Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of Russia’s Wagner group, is a “free man” who is “commenting on what is happening in Bakhmut, and how the battle has gone”.“I don’t think that he is very much wrong because the threat that existed for us on the eve of the military operation … was really the danger that presented to the existence of our state,” he said, in regards to Prigozhin saying Russia’s existence is at threat.Kuenssberg challenged him on this, saying it was untrue. Kelin replied with conjecture about the size of the Ukrainian army.Kelin went on to say that he did not agree with Prigozhin that there was a chance of “losing Russia”.In response to a question about whether the attack on a hospital is justified, he brought up apparent incidents in Luhansk and Donetsk and claimed there had not been any mentions of it in British press.Updated at 05.06 EDT3h ago04.06 EDTAn interesting piece here from the Kyiv Post on President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s speechwriting team and process.Senior correspondent Maryna Shashkova said that Zelenskiy’s team say that speeches are “80%” him.“He always knows what he wants to say, and he immediately formulates it in sentences and phrases. He speaks ready-made thoughts, the speechwriter needs to listen, take notes and possibly add what the president did not say,” a source told the Post.Others involved are Dmytro Lytvyn, a speechwriter, and Yuriy Kostyuk, who worked with Zelenskiy when he was an actor.“The main task of a speechwriter is to completely turn off your ego and become a reflection of another person. They can do it,” an official in the president’s office said.Updated at 04.27 EDT4h ago03.21 EDTA 41-year-old man died during Russia’s mass drone strike on Kyiv on Sunday morning, after being hit by falling debris.The death was confirmed by mayor Vitali Klitschko.

It was not immediately clear how many of the drones were shot over Kyiv.The air force said on Telegram that Russia had targeted military and critical infrastructure facilities in the central regions of Ukraine, and the Kyiv region in particular.Serhiy Popko, the head of Kyiv’s military administration, said earlier that preliminary information indicated the air raid was the largest drone attack since the start of Russia’s invasion in February 2022.He added that Russia used the Iranian-made Shahed drones in the attack. Reuters was not able to independently verify that information.“Today, the enemy decided to ‘congratulate’ the people of Kyiv on Kyiv Day with the help of their deadly UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles),” Popko said on the Telegram messaging app.“The attack was carried out in several waves, and the air alert lasted more than five hours.”President Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged Iran earlier this week to reconsider the supply of deadly drones to Russia in order to stop their slide into “the dark side of history”. But Iran on Saturday said his comments were really designed to attract more arms and financial aid from the west.Updated at 03.24 EDT5h ago02.01 EDTSummaryWelcome back to our live coverage of Russia’s war on Ukraine. This is Christine Kearney and here’s an overview of the latest.Russia carried out a major two-wave overnight air attack on Kyiv that killed at least one person, officials said, calling it the biggest drone attack on the capital yet since the start of the war, as Kyiv prepares to celebrate its birthday on Sunday.The pre-dawn attacks came on the last Sunday of May when the capital celebrates Kyiv Day, the anniversary of its official founding 1,541 years ago. Ukraine says it shot down more than 40 drones.More on that story soon. In other news:
Preliminary operations have begun to pave the way for a counteroffensive against Russian occupying forces, a Ukrainian presidential adviser has said. “It’s a complicated process, which is not a matter of one day or a certain date or a certain hour,” Mykhailo Podolyak said in an interview with the Guardian. “It’s an ongoing process of deoccupation, and certain processes are already happening, like destroying supply lines or blowing up depots behind the lines.
The commander of Ukraine’s armed forces, Gen Valerii Zaluzhnyi, raised expectations that a major operation could be imminent by declaring on social media: “The time has come to take back what’s ours.” Zaluzhny’s declaration on the Telegram messaging app on Saturday was accompanied by a cinematic video showing heavily armed Ukrainian soldiers preparing for battle.
Ukraine’s defence ministry has claimed Russia is planning to simulate a major accident at the occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station to try to thwart Kyiv’s long-planned counteroffensive. The plant, in an area of Russian-occupied southern Ukraine, has been repeatedly hit by shelling that each side blames the other for.
Russian forces have temporarily eased their attacks on the besieged eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut to regroup and strengthen their capabilities, a senior Kyiv official said on Saturday. Russia’s Wagner private army began handing over its positions to regular Russian troops this week after declaring full control of Bakhmut after the longest and bloodiest battle of the war, Reuters reported. In a statement on Telegram, Ukraine’s deputy defence minister, Hanna Maliar, said Russian forces have continued attacking but that “overall offensive activity has decreased”.
Russian forces have intercepted two long-range Storm Shadow cruise missiles supplied to Ukraine by Britain, the RIA news agency cited the defence ministry as saying on Saturday. Reuters reports that the ministry said it had intercepted shorter-range US-built Himars-launched and Harm missiles, and shot down 13 drones in the last 24 hours, RIA reported.
Defeat in its war against Ukraine would leave Russia “vindictive” and “brutal” and posing a threat to Nato countries, the outgoing head of the RAF said. Air Chief Marshal Sir Mike Wigston told the Telegraph that Russia’s air force, surface navy and submarine force are a threat to Britain and Nato. He warned its threat could even get worse if the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, was ousted.
A construction worker has been killed near the Russian village of Plekhovo, a few kilometres from the border with Ukraine after shelling from the Ukrainian side, said Roman Starovoyt, the governor of the Kursk region. Works were being carried out not far from Plekhovo on fortifying defensive lines for the state border, the governor said on Telegram.
Ukraine struck oil pipeline installations deep inside Russia on Saturday with a series of drone attacks including on a station serving the vast Druzhba oil pipeline that sends western Siberian crude to Europe, according to Russian media. Ukrainian drone attacks inside Russia have been growing in intensity in recent weeks, and the New York Times reported that US intelligence believes Ukraine was behind a drone attack on the Kremlin earlier this month.
Ukraine has asked Germany to supply it with Taurus cruise missiles, an air-launched weapon with a range of 500km (310 miles), a spokesperson for the defence ministry in Berlin said on Saturday. Germany received the request several days ago, the spokesperson said, confirming a report by Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. She declined to provide further details or say how likely it was that Germany would supply the missiles to Ukraine.

A further upset occurred in the parliamentary vote, where Erdoğan’s coalition won a comfortable majority.A rejuvenated, jubilant Erdoğan emerged on to the balcony at the Ankara headquarters of his Justice and Development party (AKP) after the first round votes were tallied, singing one of his campaign songs to supporters.At a rally in Istanbul on Saturday, Erdoğan urged his supporters not to be complacent after a record turnout in the first round.“Are we running to the polls tomorrow? Will we cast our votes from the early hours of the morning?” he asked a cheering crowd.Kılıçdaroğlu has offered voters a chance to end Erdoğan’s two decades in power and to prevent Turkey’s longest-serving leader from extending his rule into a third decade. During Erdoğan’s reign, first as prime minister then as president, the 69-year-old has overhauled Turkey’s political system and reshaped it in his own image, introducing a presidential system, concentrating power around his office and jailing opponents.After initially focusing on how his candidacy offered voters a chance to reverse the changes introduced by Erdoğan, including promises of a return to parliamentary democracy and messages of social inclusion, Kılıçdaroğlu’s campaign pivoted firmly to the right in advance of the run-off.A woman casts her vote in Corum, Turkey, on Sunday. Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty ImagesBoth candidates have sought to harness support from voters who opted for the third-place presidential candidate, the ultranationalist Sinan Oğan of the Victory party, who obtained roughly 5% of the presidential vote in the first round.Oğan declared his support for Erdoğan, while the head of the Victory party, Ümit Özdağ, backed Kılıçdaroğlu, claiming he believed the opposition leader was more likely to follow through on his pledge to deport millions of refugees and crack down on immigration.Kılıçdaroğlu’s messaging has focused largely on anti-immigrant sentiment in the days before the run-off, as well as signing an agreement with Özdağ including promises that represent a swipe at Kurdish voters in eastern Turkey who he previously relied on for support in the first round.The 74-year-old opposition leader has dramatically hardened his rhetoric, doubling down on his promises to deport refugees from Turkey within a year of coming to power. When polled, those who voted for Oğan in the first round said they were more likely to back Erdoğan.“This is the first time Turkey is experiencing a second round vote in a presidential election. We have never done this before, so we don’t know if the majority of voters will be more interested given that there are now two candidates. This is why it’s not easy to say what we’ll be witnessing. There may be surprises, Kılıçdaroğlu may win but I agree his chances are not high compared to Erdoğan,” said Evren Balta, a political scientists at Özyeğin University.Many opposition supporters said they were determined to vote despite their candidate heading into the run-off in second place, searching for millions of votes in addition to the support he gained in the first round but with few obvious constituencies in which to find them.When asked what is driving him to vote despite the opposition’s path to victory appearing uncertain, 24-year-old Emre Göral replied with one word and a cautious smile: “Hope.”Erdoğan has focused on assuring voters by raising the minimum wage, providing free natural gas for the month of May and promoting the growth in the country’s defence industry under his rule. While the opposition has long posited that Turkey’s deep financial crisis, including rising inflation and a high cost of living, would pry voters away from Erdoğan, many instead said they felt he was the only one capable of solving such problems.Voters in the town of Kahramanmaraş, close to the epicentres of deadly twin earthquakes that killed more than 60,000 people in Turkey and Syria in February, said Erdoğan represented a leader who has shown he is capable of solving problems, unlike his rival.“Kılıçdaroğlu can’t handle a crisis,” said 34-year-old Shukran Tutem as she arranged T-shirts on a market stall. “If we compare Kılıçdaroğlu and Erdoğan, it’s easy to see that Kılıçdaroğlu wouldn’t bring anything good for this country’s future, but Erdoğan could.”During campaigning there was frequent deployment of misinformation from both sides, including Erdoğan’s use of a deepfake video showing banned Kurdish militants declaring their support for Kılıçdaroğlu. After a first round in which the opposition initially claimed victory before accepting Erdoğan was in the lead, many opposition supporters have remained mistrustful of the result, despite the Republican People’s party stating that although it challenged counts in about 2,269 ballot boxes, this would not have changed the overall outcome.“I think this has played out in an intense way in the Turkish election because the extent of polarisation in this country is so high. These two sides are so polarised that whatever their leader, group or supporters say they have a tendency to believe it,” said Balta.In an interview with CNN after the first round, Erdoğan said he was confident of victory: “The people will be the kingmaker, and when the people decide, I believe they will stand with those who successfully served the Turkish nation for the past 21 years. In the end, my people will choose stability and competence and they will cast their votes accordingly.”TopicsTurkeyRecep Tayyip ErdoğannewsReuse this contentMore on this storyMore on this story‘He works hard’: Voters in Turkey’s quake zone backing Erdoğan in runoff 2d agoUltranationalist leader backs Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu for Turkish presidency4d agoCan Turkey’s opposition bridge enthusiasm gap before runoff vote?5d agoTurkey’s economic crisis expected to deepen after Erdoğan tops poll16 May 2023‘Erdoğan is too nationalistic’: readers on their vote in Turkey’s election15 May 2023Turkey election: what can we expect from Erdoğan v Kılıçdaroğlu runoff?15 May 2023Turkey election goes to runoff after Erdoğan takes first-round lead15 May 2023Turkey election results 2023: what we know so far15 May 2023Most viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Photograph: WPA/Getty ImagesThe ObserverBrexitMore than half of voters now want Britain to forge closer ties with the EU, poll revealsDramatic reversal in public opinion seen even in those constituencies that recorded the highest votes to leave Toby HelmSun 28 May 2023 02.00 EDTA clear majority of British voters now favours building closer relations with the European Union, according to new polling that highlights a dramatic reversal in the tide of public opinion since Brexit.Even in those constituencies that recorded the highest votes to leave the EU in 2016, more than twice as many voters now believe the best route forward is to move in the opposite direction – and forge closer ties with Brussels.The survey of more than 10,000 voters, for the internationalist campaign group Best for Britain, accompanied by detailed MRP (multilevel regression and poststratification) analysis based on new constituency boundaries, will provide sobering reading for Rishi Sunak, who backed Brexit as a route to greater economic success.The poll by Focaldata found that three times as many adults (63%) now believe Brexit has created more problems than it has solved, compared with just 21% who believe it has solved more than it has created.graphicOverall, 53% of voters now want the government to seek a closer relationship with the EU than it now has, having left the single market and customs union, against just 14% who want the UK to become more distant.In Boston and Skegness in Lincolnshire, where the vote to leave the EU was 74.9% in 2016, more than twice as many people (40%) now want closer links with the EU against just 19% who want relations to become even more distant.The MRP method is a well-regarded statistical technique that combines data from detailed polling and other information from sources such as the census and Office for National Statistics data to assign an accurate probability of how different groups will vote in different constituencies.Brexit food trade barriers have cost UK households £7bn, report findsRead moreThe polling comes after the release last week of official figures showing that net migration to the UK rose to a new high of more than 606,000 in 2022 – a 24% increase on the previous high of 488,000 in 2021 – despite government claims that Brexit would allow the UK to “take back control” of its borders. Concerns about immigration will be on the agenda at a meeting between Sunak and France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, in Moldova on Thursday.When asked to consider the UK’s visa policies, more than half of all voters polled for Best for Britain said the UK should issue more visas to allow foreign workers to come to the UK. Some 19% wanted to see more visas generally and 32% said they wanted to see more visas issued, but only in sectors with labour shortages. Only 23% wanted to see fewer visas issued.Evidence is also mounting of the damage done to the UK economy and its trade as a result of post-Brexit trade barriers, extra bureaucracy and costs to exporters and importers.Last week the Guardian reported data from the London School of Economics (LSE) showing that British households had paid £7bn since Brexit to cover the extra cost of food imports from the EU resulting from new trade barriers.While Sunak has tried to build friendlier relations with Brussels than his two predecessors, Boris Johnson and Liz Truss, he is coming under increasing pressure to do more to help UK business and to explain how the damage inflicted by Brexit on trade can be limited.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterArchie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morningPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A majority of voters now understand that.”Peter Norris, co-convener of the UK Trade and Business Commission and chair of the Virgin Group, added: “From higher inflation to fruit rotting in fields, we can see the economic impact of both labour shortages and divergence from our largest trading partner, the EU.

Photograph: Wade Vandervort/AFP/Getty ImagesRon DeSantis DeSantis accused of ‘catastrophic’ climate approach after campaign launchRepublican ‘trying to out-Trump Trump’ on climate, expert says, as governor says he rejects the ‘politicization of the weather’Oliver Milman@olliemilmanSun 28 May 2023 06.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 28 May 2023 06.06 EDTRon DeSantis has been accused of a “catastrophic” approach to the climate crisis after he launched his campaign for US president by saying he rejects the “politicization of the weather” and questioning whether hurricanes hitting his home state of Florida have been worsened by climate change.DeSantis, the Republican Florida governor who announced his bid for the White House via a glitch-heavy Twitter stream on Wednesday, has previously dismissed concerns about global heating as “leftwing stuff” and he expanded upon this theme during a Fox News interview following his campaign launch.“People tried to say when we had [Hurricane] Ian that it was because of climate change but if you look at the first 60 years from 1900 to 1960 we had more major hurricanes hit Florida than the 60 years since then,” DeSantis told his interlocutor, the former Republican congressman Trey Gowdy.“This is something that is a fact of life in the Sunshine state. I’ve always rejected the politicization of the weather.”Climate scientists have said that while it is true that hurricanes have not become significantly more frequent due to climate change, there is good evidence that the heating of the ocean, now at record levels, as well as the atmosphere is causing storms to rapidly intensify and become more powerful.A study in the wake of Hurricane Ian, which pulverized roads and buildings in Florida last year, causing $112bn in damages and around 150 deaths in total in the US, found that climate change worsened the storm’s extreme rainfall by around 10%.Michael Mann, a climate scientist at the University of Pennsylvania, said that DeSantis’s stance towards climate science is “classic projection”.“It is Ron DeSantis who is engaged in the ‘politicization of the weather’ by denying basic, established science – the intensification of tropical storms with human-caused warming of the oceans.”Mann added that DeSantis has favored fossil fuel interests over Florida’s, a state acutely vulnerable to sea level rise and more powerful storms that has “been placed directly in harm’s way by the devastating consequences of fossil fuel burning and the resulting warming of our planet”.Environmental groups have also taken aim at DeSantis over a record on climate they say is no better than Donald Trump’s, his rival for the Republican presidential nomination.While governor, DeSantis has adopted bills banning Florida’s cities from adopting 100% clean energy goals and barred the state’s pension fund from making investment decisions that consider the climate crisis due to what he called a corporate attempt to “impose an ideological agenda on the American people”. He has also attacked the US military for being “woke” for warning about the national security risks posed by climate impacts.“The cost of taking his anti-climate record to the national stage as president would be catastrophic,” said Pete Maysmith, senior vice-president of campaigns for the League of Conservation Voters. “DeSantis has already made clear he would unleash his war on climate science, clean energy jobs, and strong pollution safeguards against clean air and clean water.”During his elections to Congress and to the Florida governor’s mansion, DeSantis has taken more than $1m in campaign donations from the oil and gas industry, with his campaign committee receiving $2m just last year from Club for Growth, a conservative organization that successfully agitated for the US to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement when Trump was president.“We need fossil fuels,” DeSantis said at an event in March. “You can’t just get rid of them unless you guys want to pay a lot more for energy.”However, the governor’s supporters argue that he has forged strong environmentalist credentials in Florida, signing bills to beef up the state’s resilience to sea level rise and pledging billions of dollars to restore the ailing Everglades, which has been besieged by agricultural development and, increasingly, climate change.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First ThingFree daily newsletterStart the day with the top stories from the US, plus the day’s must-reads from across the GuardianPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He’s slugging it out in the Trump lane which is really a terrible mistake. I’m hearing from Republicans in Florida ‘why is he choosing this path?’“He could’ve said, ‘Hey, we are dealing with this climate issue in Florida, let’s lead the world on this.’ Instead he’s trying to out-Trump Trump.”Inglis said that while some senior Republicans fret they will lose out on a younger generation of climate-concerned voters, they still risk being beaten in primary races by candidates that back Trump’s ongoing embrace of climate denialism.“People like (House of Representatives speaker) Kevin McCarthy know that young conservatives want action on climate change and even if Trump wins he will be a lame duck by 2026 and the party could start moving on by then,” said Inglis.“The trouble is, the scientists say we don’t have the time to wait for that.

The warrant allows police to keep him in custody for longer, according to Yonhap news agency. He was not charged at the hearing on Sunday.Officials gave the man’s surname as Lee but not his full name, as is the usual custom.Lee said he opened the door because he wanted to get off the plane quickly. “I feel really sorry for the kids,” he told reporters as he was escorted to the court for a hearing on Sunday, apparently referring to students who were onboard and taken to hospital with breathing issues. They were all discharged after about two hours, a fire department official said.Asiana stopped sales of seats closest to the exit on the Airbus model starting on Sunday, Yonhap said. The airline could not be immediately reached for comment outside business hours.A South Korean transport ministry official said on Friday that it was possible to open emergency exits at or near ground level because the pressure inside and outside the cabin was similar.TopicsSouth KoreaAir transportAsia PacificnewsReuse this contentMore on this storyMore on this storyWind buffets plane passengers as door opened on flight in South Korea2d agoGucci show reaffirms Seoul’s status as capital of pop culture16 May 2023Japanese PM expresses sympathy with Korean victims of colonial rule7 May 2023Zebra captured after three hours on the run in Seoul23 Mar 2023South Korea U-turns on 69-hour working week after youth backlash15 Mar 2023K-pop star Jin of BTS starts his military service in South Korea13 Dec 2022All South Koreans to become younger as traditional age system scrapped9 Dec 2022South Korea scrambles jets after Chinese and Russian warplanes enter air defence zone30 Nov 2022Most viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Photograph: APThe ObserverVaticanThe pope and Emanuela Orlandi: Vatican back in the spotlight over mystery of missing girlShe was 15 when she was last seen alive in Rome. Her brother explains why he backs a new theory featured in a TV showAngela Giuffrida in RomeSun 28 May 2023 03.00 EDTNot long before she disappeared in the summer of 1983, Emanuela Orlandi went to Piazza del Catalone, a small square just outside of the Vatican walls, to meet friends.There was still a party vibe during that sweltering June just a few weeks after AS Roma clinched the Serie A title. In a photograph taken at the time Orlandi, who was then 15, is wearing a headband in yellow and red, the football team’s colours, that her mother had made. It was one of the last photographs taken of the teenager before she vanished without trace on 22 June 1983, an image that has come to define the campaign of her older brother Pietro Orlandi’s unrelenting search for the truth.“Emanuela was always here with friends,” he said in an interview with the Observer in Piazza del Catalone. “They were still celebrating; it was the last photo taken of her smiling.”The disappearance of Emanuela – who has not been seen by her family since leaving her home within Vatican City, where her father was a lay employee in the papal household, for a flute lesson in Rome – has gripped Italy for four decades. But it was only in January this year that the powerful and inscrutable Holy See began its own investigation, with its promoter of justice, Alessandro Diddi, promising to leave no stone unturned in a mystery that has produced many theories, some of them outlandish, but no concrete facts. Prosecutors in Rome began collaborating with the Vatican on the probe this month.“For 40 years there has never been a collaboration between the two,” said Orlandi, who recently caused controversy after insinuating that the much-revered Pope John Paul II might have been involved in his younger sister’s disappearance. “Until a few years ago the Vatican said it knew nothing, that she disappeared in Italy and so it needed to be investigated there. On the other hand, I’m told Rome has lots of documents. For all these years the Vatican has stayed silent – maybe this means someone there has proof of what happened.”Vatican reopens investigation into teenager who went missing in 1983Read moreThe Vatican’s investigation began a few months after the Netflix series, Vatican Girl, brought Emanuela’s case back under the global spotlight. The series explored theories that have emerged over the years, the first one being that she was kidnapped by a gang in order to blackmail the Vatican into releasing Mehmet Ali Ağca, who was jailed in 1981 after trying to assassinate John Paul II. Her disappearance has also been linked to a wave of financial scandals at the Vatican bank, an alleged sex ring run by Vatican police, and the mafia.Another theory was that Emanuela was taken to London, where she lived for years in a youth hostel owned by a Catholic congregation, with her expenses funded by the Vatican. According to this hypothesis, she died in London before her body was transferred back to Rome and buried in the Vatican. In 2019, two tombs in the Vatican were reopened after a tipoff that Emanuela may have been buried there. No human remains were found.But the new, and most startling, claim in the Netflix series came from a childhood friend of Emanuela, who said the teenager had confided in her about being molested by “someone close” to John Paul II.“She said the conversation happened a few days before Emanuela disappeared and that [the alleged incident] took place in the Vatican gardens,” said Orlandi. That Emanuela might have been a victim of paedophilia is probably the most plausible theory, he added. “When you know in that environment they do certain things, maybe she was put in that situation?”Orlandi’s determination to find the truth has irked the Vatican. In April, during questioning with Vatican prosecutors, he shared an audio tape containing an alleged conversation between a journalist and the boss of a Rome criminal organisation suspected of being embroiled in Emanuela’s disappearance. In the recording, the crime boss insinuated that the late John Paul II, whose original name was Karol Józef Wojtyła, would go out at night with senior clergymen in search of teenage girls.Part of the audio was subsequently aired on an Italian TV programme during an interview with Orlandi, in which he added: “They tell me that Wojtyła occasionally went out in the evening with two Polish monsignors, and it certainly wasn’t to bless homes.”Pietro Orlandi has welcomed the Vatican investigation.

I also gave the names of the two monsignors, who were close to John Paul. Everyone knew they would sometimes go out at night together. I simply added that their [outings] were not for religious reasons.”He has also been left wondering if Pope Francis knew anything about his sister’s fate when, shortly after his election in 2013, the pontiff told him that Emanuela was “in heaven”.“He told me these words, I don’t know why,” said Orlandi. “For [Joseph] Ratzinger [his predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI], Emanuela was a taboo. So the fact that Francis used her name made me think he wanted to collaborate with me, but since then he has never wanted to meet again.”Orlandi, who has three other sisters, described a privileged childhood within the Vatican walls, where they enjoyed the gardens and felt as if they were in “the safest place in the world”.His pursuit of the truth is partly influenced by guilt. On the day she disappeared Emanuela had asked him to give her a lift to her flute lesson. “It was so hot in Rome, and I didn’t want to go,” he said. “She was a little angry, and left. I still wonder whether this would have happened if I had taken her.”Time will tell if the investigation will bring the answers he needs. “For all these years we don’t know if Emanuela is alive or dead,” he said. “I will continue my battle to the very end.”TopicsVaticanThe ObserverItalyEuropePope John Paul IIPope Benedict XVIPope FrancisThe papacynewsReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

It sits adjacent to the old circular parliament building which was constructed in 1927 during the colonial era, which will now be converted into a museum.The building was inaugurated by Modi on Sunday morning, who, dressed in traditional attire, took part in several prayer rituals.“May this iconic building be a cradle of empowerment,” said Modi in a tweet after the ceremony. “May it propel our great nation to new heights of progress.”Modi’s plan to rebuild India’s parliament draws fierce criticismRead moreHundreds of members of the opposition parties were conspicuous by their absence. Earlier in the week, they had come together to announce a boycott of the ceremony, arguing it should be the country’s president, who is largely a ceremonial figure, not Modi who inaugurated the parliament building, calling it a violation on the constitution and parliamentary procedure.In an open letter, opposition groups described Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government as “authoritarian” and said Modi’s decision “to inaugurate the Parliament building by himself, completely sidelining president Murmu, is not only a grave insult but a direct assault on our democracy … When the soul of democracy has been sucked out [of] Parliament, we find no value in a new building.”The BJP hit back, calling on opposition parties not to “politicise” the ceremony.Indian prime minister Narendra Modi carries a royal golden sceptre to be installed near the chair of the speaker during the inaugural ceremony of the new parliament building, in New Delhi Photograph: APSpeaking after Sunday’s ceremony took place, Supriya Sule, an MP from Congress, the largest opposition party, questioned how the government could go ahead without opposition participation.“To open a new parliament building without the opposition makes it an incomplete event,” she said. “It means there is no democracy in the country”.The new parliament project had attracted controversy from the start, with the Modi government accused of rebuilding the nation’s corridors of power in its own image as part of their nationalistic political agenda. Launching the project in 2020, Modi had said the new parliament building would “become a witness to the creation of a self-reliant India”.The overall development, known as the Central Vista project, cost over $2.4bn and involved building a new government secretariat and a new prime minister’s residence and office. It was accused of a lack of transparency after it was awarded to architect Bimal Patel, who is from Modi’s home state of Gujarat and has been granted some of the most high profile government projects in recent years.But the government and the project’s architects had argued that the old building, which is almost 100 years old, was no longer fit for purpose and could not be adapted.The new complex is three times larger than the old one and has room to seat over 1200 MPs, over 500 more than the original parliament. Though India currently has 800 representatives across the upper and lower house, the numbers are up for review in 2026. Given the increase in India’s population to 1.4 billion people, the number of MPs could be raised.According to the architect, materials and designs had been brought in from all over India to reflect the country’s cultural diversity and different architectural styles, including marble from Rajasthan and teak from Maharastra.A sacred Sengol, a gold sceptre from the southern state of Tamil Nadu which had been received by India’s first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru on independence in 1947, was also placed by Modi in the new parliament chamber.TopicsIndiaNarendra ModiDelhinewsReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Countries representing more than 50 per cent of the global population have refused to back the condemnation of Russia, despite the fact that they understand that “a grotesque abuse of international law” has taken place.While just five countries have supported the Russians in the UN, “40 or 50 countries have refused to join any condemnation, not because they support the invasion of Ukraine, but they feel that the west has been guilty of hypocrisy and weakness in dealing with global problems over the last 30 years”, Miliband said.The chief executive of the International Rescue Committee encouraged the audience to read the speeches of President William Ruto of Kenya, who “talks about how the effort in Ukraine should be contrasted with the effort to tackle those other wars in other parts of the world”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterArchie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morningPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

DeSantis’s limp start to 2024 race delights Trump but battle is not over
Lorenzo Tondo in Palermo@lorenzo_tondoSun 28 May 2023 06.00 EDTIf Luigia Colucci, one of Ron DeSantis’s Italian great-grandmothers, tried to emigrate to the US today, she most likely couldn’t meet current standards to enter the country – the same standards that her great-grandson has promised to further restrict if elected to the White House.Nevertheless, the official announcement that DeSantis will run for the Republican presidential nomination was welcomed with enthusiasm by many people in Italy, with at least five towns and two regions claiming the man as their own.All eight great-grandparents of DeSantis, who recently signed what has been described as the strongest anti-immigration bill in the US, were migrants from southern Italy who were among the hundreds of thousands of Italians who left home in the early 20th century in search of a better future.Luigia left Italy in early 1917, from Castelfranci, a village in the province of Avellino, in the southern region of Campania.“It is an honour and a pleasure to be connected to such an important man as DeSantis,” the mayor of Castelfranci, Generoso Cresta, told the Italian press. “The surname Colucci is very common here, even if, unfortunately, the heirs of that generation of emigrants have lost contact with their countries of origin.”Florida governor Ron DeSantis is seeking the Republican presidential nomination. His great-grandparents emigrated from Italy in the early 20th century. Photograph: Marco Bello/ReutersBut Castelfranci is not the only town claiming DeSantis as its own. About 125 miles north, the mayor of Bugnara, in the province of Aquila, said DeSantis belonged to them. “We are proud of him,” mayor Domenico Taglieri told the Adnkronos news agency, describing him as “a second-generation Bugnarese running for the White House.“It’s great news. We are rooting for DeSantis, hoping to be able to host him in town as soon as possible.”According to media reports, the governor of Florida still has a distant relative in Bugnara: Osvaldo Lupi.“His great-grandmother, Maria Nolfi, was my grandfather Domenico’s sister,” Lupi told Adnkronos. “Both emigrated to America. She died young, when she was just 43 years old, after marrying Nicola DeSantis. Daniel James DeSantis, the governor’s grandfather, was born from their marriage in the US, and, in turn, married Viola Petrella, also of Abruzzo origins.”James DeSantis and Viola Petrella had a son named Ronald Daniel DeSantis, father of the aspiring US presidential candidate.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to This is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pivotal stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, the government is yet to make any changes and campaigners believe that a rebellion of backbench Tory MPs threatens to pile pressure on ministers to make only modest tweaks to the framework, which would continue to hold back the rollout of English wind farms.The ban on onshore wind, which is the cheapest source of electricity, is estimated to have cost UK billpayers £800m over the past winter when millions were plunged into fuel poverty for the first time due to rising global energy market prices, according to analysts at the Energy and Climate Change Intelligence Unit (ECIU).British households face energy bills that are expected to remain above pre-pandemic levels until the end of the decade after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine triggered a surge in global energy markets last year. Although global energy market prices have retreated from record highs they are likely to remain far higher than usual while European countries seek alternative energy sources to help replace Russia’s gas exports.Miliband said the Conservatives’ “absurd ban on onshore wind” had cost every family in Britain £180 and left the energy system “dependent on fossil fuel dictators like Putin”.Sam Richards, the founder and campaign director of Britain Remade, which campaigns for green economic growth, said: “It’s simply mind-boggling that Ukraine, while it fights for its survival, has built more onshore wind capacity than England.“The government should start by dropping its ban on new onshore wind farms in England – at the stroke of a pen unlocking the cheapest source of energy available.”The Labour party has put forward plans to end the onshore wind ban and make Britain “a clean energy superpower” by 2030. Part of its plan includes setting up publicly owned energy company, GB Energy, to produce “cheap, clean power in Britain, for Britain”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Russia-Ukraine war – latest coverage
Julian Borger in KyivSat 27 May 2023 22.37 EDTLast modified on Sun 28 May 2023 06.30 EDTRussia unleashed the biggest drone attack against Kyiv of the war so far overnight as the city prepared to mark the annual celebration of its founding. However, according to Ukrainian military officials, almost all the Iranian-made aircraft were shot down.The air force said it shot down 52 out of 54 Shahed drones launched against the city in successive waves, but falling debris still killed one man, injured two people, and set ablaze the roof of a shopping centre.The attack appeared to come from the north and south and at low altitudes. A spokesperson from Operational Command South said the Russians appeared to seeking ways of evading Ukrainian’s steadily improving air defences.“The enemy traditionally used the eastern coast of the Azov Sea to attack, but the routes of these aircraft were somewhat unconventional,” the spokesperson told reporters. “They tried to bypass southern air defences as much as possible … They mostly flew over the temporarily occupied territories and dispersed across Ukraine.“They are trying to gravitate towards riverbeds to hide the direction of movement of the Shahed groups,” she added. “We continue to study new approaches in tactics to be as effective as possible.”The drone attacks came in the early hours of Kyiv Day, the annual celebration of the city’s founding 1,541 years ago, marked by street fairs and live concerts.Russia says military drone attempted to strike gas facility near MoscowRead more“The history of Ukraine is a longstanding irritant for the insecure Russians,” Andriy Yermak, the head of Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s office, said on his Telegram channel.Serhiy Popko, the head of the capital’s military administration, said on the Telegram messaging app: “Today, the enemy decided to ‘congratulate’ the people of Kyiv on Kyiv Day with the help of their deadly UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles).“The attack was carried out in several waves, and the air alert lasted more than five hours.”In some parts of the city, local residents, inured to Russian air raids, stood on their balconies, shouting slogans praising Ukrainian air defences and defying Vladimir Putin and Russia.Military observers have suggested that another goal of the constant stream of Russian air attacks is to exhaust Ukrainian air defence ammunition using cheap Iranian drones. Ukrainian officials have told western capitals that a shortage of anti-aircraft missiles is one of their most pressing concerns, ahead of a planned spring counteroffensive against Russian occupying forces.TopicsUkraineEuropeRussianewsReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Photograph: Susan Walsh/AFP/Getty ImagesThe ObserverJoe BidenThe moment has arrived: Biden must give Ukraine all it needs to winSimon TisdallIt’s Zelenskiy who is setting the pace diplomatically and strategically. The US must end the prevaricating that may have needlessly prolonged the warSun 28 May 2023 02.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 28 May 2023 06.37 EDTFoot-dragging, indecision and fearfulness have characterised Joe Biden’s off-screen approach to Ukraine since Russia invaded 15 months ago, compounding doubts about the durability of US support as the 2024 presidential election campaign kicks off. The contrast between Biden and the bold, energetic leadership of Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, is striking. One man frets about disaster and loss. The other thinks only of winning.Biden’s latest, belated and incomplete volte-face, over providing US-made F-16 combat jets, illustrates the problem. Zelenskiy has been asking for fighter planes since the war began. Neighbours such as Poland were sympathetic. Yet afraid of provoking a fight with Russia, Biden, national security adviser Jake Sullivan, and Pentagon officials publicly opposed supplying F-16s until as recently as March.Zelenskiy wanted the planes because he knew Ukraine was vulnerable from the air. As the invasion unfolded, Ukraine’s people, homes and vital infrastructure were mercilessly pounded by Russian missiles. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has explained how F-16s or similar planes might have supported air defence systems, reduced casualties and protected ground troops. But they were not forthcoming.Biden and Sullivan also rejected proposals by experienced former US generals for Nato-patrolled “humanitarian no-fly zones”, initially in western Ukraine, to protect civilians from aerial assault. Although admittedly risky, safe havens akin to past operations in Iraq, Bosnia and Libya might have saved many lives and stemmed the refugee exodus. They still could.Biden’s argument, then as now, is that such interventions, coming on top of large-scale US arms shipments, intelligence-sharing and aid, might be viewed by Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, as escalatory. This seems sensible at first glance. Yet it’s way too cautious. Putin and his lickspittle poltroons, Dmitry Medvedev and Sergei Lavrov, are adept at playing on western fears. Whenever new forms of assistance for Kyiv are mooted, they spew dire threats, sometimes involving nuclear weapons.Biden should listen to Antony Blinken. His secretary of state has spotted a pattern over the past year: Kremlin warnings of retaliation and direct confrontation rarely amount to much in practice. The Russians huff and puff – but mostly bluff. Putin is not entirely stupid. He knows he’d never win a fight with Nato, let alone survive nuclear warfare.Another pattern is apparent: Biden’s chronic indecision. Protracted humming and hawing last year delayed supplies of Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, Patriot batteries, longer-range high-altitude missiles, and M1 Abrams battle tanks – all of which were eventually delivered. European allies such as Germany used White House waffling to excuse their own foot-dragging. These prevarications may have needlessly prolonged the war.The F-16 U-turn, confirmed at last weekend’s G7 summit in Hiroshima, paves the way for training Ukrainian pilots and the provision of “fourth-generation” jets by Nato allies. Yet it’s a typical Biden fudge. The US itself has not committed to supply planes. If it does, it’s unclear whether they will be the latest F-16 models equipped with the latest weapons.A still image from video showing a drone attack on the Kremlin – allegedly the work of Ukraine. Photograph: Ostorozhno Novosti/ReutersUnconvincing explanations are offered for US dithering. Officials say they followed a deliberate plan to ensure Ukraine first received all the heavy weaponry and armoured vehicles required for its long-anticipated counter-offensive. “We could certainly have started earlier, but there were much higher priorities, and it’s seen by some as an escalatory act,” said US air force secretary Frank Kendall, referring to F-16 training.In fact, it was pressure from US allies that proved irresistible when the 50-nation Ukraine Contact Group met at Ramstein air base in Germany last month. US defence secretary Lloyd Austin was urged to think again by old friends such as Britain and the Netherlands, as well as by the eastern Europeans. On his return to Washington, Austin advised Biden to drop his veto.The American shift on fighter planes is a personal triumph for Zelenskiy. His tireless lobbying bore fruit, once again overcoming Biden’s hesitancy and assuaging, if not dispelling, his misgivings. And it shone a light on yet another emerging pattern: how Ukraine’s president, not America’s risk-averse commander-in-chief or the Nato alliance, is driving the west’s wartime agenda.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterArchie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morningPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Ukraine does not belong to the G7, or to the EU or Nato for that matter. But Zelenskiy has earned a place at the top table. His irrepressible diplomacy, aided by Putin’s blundering, has brought membership of both latter organisations within reach.As a leader capable of inspiring his people and influencing international opinion, Zelenskiy puts Biden, Emmanuel Macron, Olaf Scholz and Rishi Sunak to shame. He is also changing the strategic conversation in fundamental ways. US policy towards China, especially Taiwan, has hardened tangibly due to Russia’s aggression – but also thanks to Zelenskiy’s success in re-emphasising the inviolability of territorial borders and national sovereignty as globally recognised imperatives.Ukraine is increasingly setting the pace on the ground, too, independently of its main backers. Incursions into southern Russia by anti-regime militia using US military vehicles, an audacious drone attack on the Kremlin, sabotage, assassinations and mystery explosions in occupied Crimea are a likely prelude to Kyiv’s pivotal counter-offensive. Success is vital if it is to head off Chinese and possible Franco-German pressure this winter to trade land for peace.All this activity, licit and illicit, is compounding White House jitters as American public support for Ukraine appears to soften. Since neither of his main 2024 Republican challengers, Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis, is committed to assisting Kyiv, Biden must be braver and do more, faster – for his time, and Ukraine’s, may be running out. Biden describes the war as a seminal struggle between liberty and tyranny. It is.

Preliminary operations have begun to pave the way for a counteroffensive against Russian occupying forces, a Ukrainian presidential adviser has said. “It’s a complicated process, which is not a matter of one day or a certain date or a certain hour,” Mykhailo Podolyak said in an interview with the Guardian. “It’s an ongoing process of deoccupation, and certain processes are already happening, like destroying supply lines or blowing up depots behind the lines.
The commander of Ukraine’s armed forces, Gen Valerii Zaluzhnyi, raised expectations that a major operation could be imminent by declaring on social media: “The time has come to take back what’s ours.” Zaluzhny’s declaration on the Telegram messaging app on Saturday was accompanied by a cinematic video showing heavily armed Ukrainian soldiers preparing for battle.
Explosions shook the Ukrainian capital in early hours on Sunday, Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko said, adding that information was being clarified and defence systems were downing air targets. Klitschko said that at least one person had been killed and more injured in the night raids on Kyiv.
Ukraine’s defence ministry has claimed Russia is planning to simulate a major accident at the occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station to try to thwart Kyiv’s long-planned counteroffensive. The plant, in an area of Russian-occupied southern Ukraine, has been repeatedly hit by shelling that each side blames the other for.
Russian forces have temporarily eased their attacks on the besieged eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut to regroup and strengthen their capabilities, a senior Kyiv official said on Saturday. Russia’s Wagner private army began handing over its positions to regular Russian troops this week after declaring full control of Bakhmut after the longest and bloodiest battle of the war, Reuters reported. In a statement on Telegram, the deputy defence minister, Hanna Maliar, said Russian forces have continued attacking but that “overall offensive activity has decreased”.
Russian forces have intercepted two long-range Storm Shadow cruise missiles supplied to Ukraine by Britain, the RIA news agency cited the defence ministry as saying on Saturday. Reuters reports that the ministry said it had intercepted shorter-range US-built Himars-launched and Harm missiles, and shot down 13 drones in the last 24 hours, RIA reported.
Defeat in its war against Ukraine would leave Russia “vindictive” and “brutal” and posing a threat to Nato countries, the outgoing head of the RAF said. Air Chief Marshal Sir Mike Wigston told The Telegraph that Russia’s air force, surface navy and submarine force are a threat to Britain and Nato. He warned its threat could even get worse if the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, was ousted.
A construction worker has been killed near the Russian village of Plekhovo, a few kilometres from the border with Ukraine after shelling from the Ukrainian side, said Roman Starovoyt, the governor of the Kursk region. Works were being carried out not far from Plekhovo on fortifying defensive lines for the state border, the governor said on Telegram.
Ukraine struck oil pipeline installations deep inside Russia on Saturday with a series of drone attacks including on a station serving the vast Druzhba oil pipeline that sends western Siberian crude to Europe, according to Russian media. Ukrainian drone attacks inside Russia have been growing in intensity in recent weeks, and the New York Times reported that US intelligence believes Ukraine was behind a drone attack on the Kremlin earlier this month.
Ukraine has asked Germany to supply it with Taurus cruise missiles, an air-launched weapon with a range of 500 km (310 miles), a spokesperson for the defence ministry in Berlin said on Saturday. Germany received the request several days ago, the spokesperson said, confirming a report by Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. She declined to provide further details or say how likely it was that Germany would supply the missiles to Ukraine.
Russia has dismissed criticism from the US president, Joe Biden, over Moscow’s plan to deploy tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, saying Washington had for decades deployed just such nuclear weapons in Europe. Russia said on Thursday it was pushing ahead with the first deployment of such weapons outside its borders since the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union, and the Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, said the weapons were already on the move.
Russia is to start expelling German diplomats, teachers and employees of cultural institutions next month. The measure is expected to further exacerbate tensions between the two countries, which have already had very fraught ties since Russia invaded Ukraine early last year.
Russia failed in a bid to prevent Ukraine taking a place on the World Health Organization’s executive board, on a day which also saw North Korea gain a berth. Ten countries joined the board for a three-year term but Russia tried to exclude Ukraine from joining the 34-nation forum at the ongoing World Health Assembly in Geneva.
Russia has accused Japan of “cynical, unscrupulous speculation” over Tokyo’s comments around the nuclear threat Moscow poses and promised to respond to Japan’s latest round of sanctions imposed over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Japan’s chief cabinet secretary, Hirokazu Matsuno, said on Friday that Japan would place additional sanctions on Russia after the G7 summit Tokyo hosted last week agreed to step up measures to punish Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.
Tehran on Saturday accused Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, of anti-Iranian propaganda in his call for Iran to halt the supply of drones to Russia, saying his comments were designed to attract more arms and financial aid from the west. Zelenskiy in a video address on Wednesday called on Iranians to stop their slide into “the dark side of history” by supplying Moscow with drones.

Composite: Getty; Alamy; Allstar; Corbis/GettyThe ObserverFocusWhy film stars are getting older - and what it tells us about Hollywood’s new struggleIn an age of safe-bet franchises, reboots and sequels, young talent is being squeezed out of the limelightWendy IdeSun 28 May 2023 05.00 EDTThe movie star is dead. At least according to the group of disgruntled sales agents, production executives and Hollywood insiders that spoke to the industry paper Variety during the Cannes film festival. The argument goes that, while there are plenty of veteran stars still busily creaking out commercially tempting film fodder, there are precious few equivalently bankable talents from the newer generation waiting in the wings. And this is a looming problem for the film industry.Harrison Ford, for example, may still just about look the part of Indiana Jones (thanks in no small measure to the wonders of de-ageing tech), in the Cannes festival hot ticket Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny. But he’s 80 years old. How much longer can he cope with the demanding and rigorous shooting schedule of a big-budget action movie?Elsewhere in Cannes, in the Marché du Film – the market in which new film products are funded and hawked to distributors and financiers – Variety reports that the hottest titles include a reboot of the 1993 Rocky Mountains-set heist thriller Cliffhanger, which sees the film’s original star, the now 76-year-old Sylvester Stallone, returning to scramble up the side of yet another precipitous peak.Harrison Ford in 1981’s Raiders of the Lost Ark. Photograph: Paramount Pictures\lucasfilm/AllstarOther titles available include Breakout, an action thriller starring Arnold Schwarzenegger (75) and That’s Amore, a romcom that is set to star John Travolta (69) and John Travolta’s hair implants (age undetermined).On one hand, you could argue it’s admirable that, in an industry that supposedly prizes youth and beauty above all else, that the old and the wrinkly still have such currency (although not so much, it seems, if they happen to be female). But if grumbling industry insiders truly believe that there are no new movie stars – and Margot Robbie, Timothée Chalamet, Michael B Jordan, Janelle Monáe, Jennifer Lawrence and, most recently, Paul Mescal would no doubt beg to differ – then this is indeed symptomatic of a broader problem in the movie industry. Just not the one that they think it is.This myopia when it comes to seeing the potential in the next generation tells of an industry that has become increasingly risk-averse over the past few decades. Steered by the shareholders and moneymen, studios have intensified their search for the elusive “sure thing”. In practice, this means they are more likely than ever to invest in the familiar, supposedly safe bets such as remakes of proven properties, franchises, movie adaptations of board and video games – anything, in fact, with a degree of name recognition.This also applies to the casting, leading to the hiring of the same well-loved but increasingly arthritic stars in roles to which they are patently unsuited. It’s the kind of creative cowardice that results when you cede control of the arts to the accountants. It has gradually stifled the supply of daring, original films, and is a key aspect that may have hindered the development of new top-tier acting talents.It’s worth pointing out that there’s a potential disparity between the way that Hollywood quantifies the idea of a “movie star”, and the way the film fans and audiences assess stardom. The industry metric is counted in box-office dollars. It boils down to whether a star can “open” a film (whether the star’s name alone will ensure an audience, and by extension guarantee a financial return). Whereas for movie audiences, stardom is quantified rather differently. Do they draw your eye in every scene? Is there a frisson of excitement in the cinema when they appear on the screen? Are they the elementy ou remember most vividly at the end of the picture?While there’s general agreement between the industry and the punters, there are instances in which an actor can achieve star status without raking in mega-bucks for the studios. Nicole Kidman, for example, is certainly a star but is by no means a box-office certainty. And Kristen Stewart earned star status from the Twilight series but her choices have veered towards the esoteric and arthouse – the wistful supernatural stalker movie Personal Shopper, the divisive Princess Diana biopic Spencer – with commensurately modest financial returns.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Film WeeklyFree newsletterTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Photograph: APThe media landscape has changed dramatically since the days when Ford and Stallone first burst on to the scenes. And there has been a shift in our relationship with stars and stardom. Social media may have destroyed some of the mystique that formerly surrounded the movie star as an entity, but it has also meant that there is a degree of accountability for actions on and off the set, that studios are less inclined or able to protect their stars from scrutiny. Several contenders for next-generation stardom – for example Jonathan Majors, Ezra Miller and Shia LaBeouf – have found that their ascent has been abruptly curtailed by such turbulence.Recently, it seems that most problems in the movie industry tend to get laid at the feet of the streaming platforms. And the issue of the lack of new movie stars is no exception. Certainly, the sheer volume of product now available is a factor. A breakthrough performance in a series – Will Smith in The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air for example – was a reasonably well-trodden route to stardom, but a role in a streamed series or film simply doesn’t have the traction it formerly had, partly because of marketing strategies, and partly because not everyone subscribes to every streaming service.In fact, something that has had more of an impact on the cultivation of a new generation of star power is the double-pronged death grip that Marvel and DC have had on the mainstream movie landscape over the last decade or so. Promising talents – people like Elizabeth Olsen, Michael B Jordan and Letitia Wright – get sucked up by the ever-hungry content machine of the comic book franchises, and locked into lengthy contracts. And let’s face it, there is only so much you can do to build your own profile as a rising star actor when you are part of a sprawling ensemble cast and the real star is the intellectual property (IP).What you notice when you look back at the films that spawned the veteran movie stars who are still perceived to dominate the commercial landscape today, is how crucial original stories and properties, rather than today’s franchises, sequels and remakes, were as a springboard to elevate acting talent to star status.Sylvester Stallone broke through with Rocky, a comparatively low-budget rags-to-riches sports drama that he wrote, and fought tooth and nail to star in. It became the highest-grosser of 1976, and Stallone went from virtual nobody to one of the hottest stars of his generation.Harrison Ford had been a well-regarded rising talent, with supporting roles in pictures such as American Graffiti and The Conversation. Stardom came with the role of Han Solo in George Lucas’s sci-fi space opera Star Wars.Cannes 2023 week two roundup – still a country for old men?Read moreTom Cruise, widely regarded as the most bankable star of all time, honed his star power through a series of wildly popular mainstream movies: films such as Top Gun, Cocktail and Rain Man were all original stories that were embraced by audiences, along with their toothy, clean-cut leading man.In a release calendar dominated by comic book franchises, remakes and IP-driven cash-ins like The Super Mario Bros. Movie, perhaps there’s now just less scope and opportunity for a budding star to make their mark. If the industry is serious about cultivating a new generation of movie stars, perhaps it’s time that it stepped out of the marketing safe space and started taking a few more creative risks.TopicsFocusThe ObserverCannes film festivalMarvelfeaturesReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Photograph: Evan Hurd/Corbis/Getty ImagesThe ObserverFitnessGetting physical: in search of aerobics guru Richard SimmonsHaving chanced on the 80s fitness star and pop culture icon, Emma Forrest was bereft when he disappeared. Where did he go, how would she cope without him?Emma ForrestSun 28 May 2023 05.00 EDTFor as long as I lived in Los Angeles, I was looking for the angels of its name. The mural of the Virgin Mary above the local ATM. The ongoing saga of the Silver Lake convent over which pop star Katy Perry was in a legal battle with nuns. There was the Apache psychic who called, “Archangel Michael, guide us!” from the back room of her husband’s boxing studio in the Valley. And the movie star who rescued the worst of the worst addicts – people in the industry whisper “He’s a saint!”Though instantly recognisable for his halo of hair, Richard Simmons, who arrived in the city in the 1970s, emerged too strongly from the realm of camp to receive nomination to sainthood. Once he gave up dreams of acting, he’d make his name through his Sweatin’ to the Oldies aerobics videos, his place in 80s pop culture recreated by The White Lotus’s Murray Bartlett in the most recent season of Apple’s exercise dramedy, Physical. Through the decades Richard was so famous he appeared regularly on David Letterman and Howard Stern, and guested on shows from CHiPs to Arrested Development. It was easy for contestants to “become” him on RuPaul’s Drag Race because his signature upbeat energy was so extreme as to appear deranged. His short shorts and tights, combined with the way his female followers loved him as they had Liberace, made him mockable in TV sketch shows. But from the moment I met him, I believed he was a kind of saint.The highest honour was if Richard came close and shrieked in your faceI was engaged to an actor who lived in a guest house with a stone angel overlooking the city, the view across Mulholland Drive as mesmerising as he was. When we met, I was paying a ton to work out with a handsome celebrity trainer who had me pull tyres up and down a track until I had his signature bubble butt. But, in the months before my wedding, I’d come in shaking from arguments, unable to stop crying. We sat on the tyres instead of pulling them up the track.“You can’t get married,” he told me.Once someone has said that out loud and you’re not able to take their advice, you can’t go back. I told myself he was just too good looking to keep training with.Richard Simmons had been one of the very first to “brand” himself, but, as I cast around for a new workout, it was a surprise to find his gym, Slimmons, was still open after 40 years, still offering twice-weekly aerobics classes with the man himself. The gym was a bare-bones auditorium, his classes cheap as chips and, most significantly, if you were too overweight or old to exercise standing up, he would provide a chair. There were mirrors but no mirror faces. Until Slimmons, gyms were only for people who were already in shape. Not only did he answer all fanmail and emails himself, but Richard, who made hundreds of millions of dollars from his workout tapes, regularly drove elderly attendees to class.Born in 1948, he was overweight by the age of four, and by five knew his weight was perceived negatively. As an adult, he wanted to act but only played “freak show” characters in Fellini’s Satyricon and The Clowns, reaching a peak of 121.5kg. On losing 45kg, he turned to sharing his aerobic journey professionally. The origin story of Hollywood stars is often people arriving there from puritanical places – Judy Garland from Minnesota, Brad Pitt from Missouri. It could be argued that Hollywood is rigid compared to growing up in New Orleans, where Richard’s Russian Jewish mother had been a travelling fan dancer.On setting foot in his class, I recognised Richard as a particular kind of Jewish man from my family tree. He was cut from the same cloth as my dad, running up and down the stairs carrying the cat on a throne made from a basket of folded laundry, or Uncle Len guiding us, skipping, through the cemetery on Halloween. I recognised in him the combination of manic and warm. I knew, by the end of my first session, that the highest honour was if Richard came close and shrieked in your face. From someone so inherently warm, it was like an ice bath from one of LA’s famous Koreatown spas: alarming, invigorating and value for money.‘I recognised his combination of manic and warm’: writer Emma Forrest at home. Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The ObserverAfter that first class, like everyone else, I lined up to have my picture taken with him. I gave him a book of mine I thought he’d like, and he posed, gasping at the content as if scandalised. I took photos with him a few times after that, then I realised I wouldn’t need to do that every week. A successful week was when I saw both Richard and my beloved therapist, the only one I’ve ever had to talk Aboriginal dream theory in sessions.Exercise has always been about mental health to me, something I struggled with in my teens and early 20s. The irony is that what drew me to Richard was the way he seemed to do jumping jacks atop a lava beneath which lay complete madness. I thought of Bob Dylan’s Isis: “What drives me to you is what drives me insane.” I couldn’t imagine Richard ever listening to Dylan, or any music that didn’t feel related to an epileptic fit. If I could encapsulate all my classes into one moment, it’s doing the grapevine to a hi-NRG remix of My Heart Will Go On, a 90-year-old side-eyeing me to make sure I wasn’t moving in on her spot in the front row, Richard screaming in aerobic delirium, dressed as Black Swan. He wore too many costumes to list but I particularly remember a Highland Fling tartan and an outfit made from sporks.I took my fiancé, Ben, to a class, charmed he was happy to take part in this absurd and absurdist 90 minutes. When Ben (who is not a gym person) was overwhelmed, Richard flipped his dentures at him to make him laugh. Afterwards we talked about the scent of Richard’s pancake makeup, as distinctly LA as jacaranda flowers and tacos. That Richard made you laugh when you were struggling felt akin to longterm love in action.On 15 February 2014, Richard didn’t show up for his class and never came back again. His devastated followers eventually had police do a senior welfare check. The police reported he was alive, he just didn’t want to be a public figure any more. As anyone who has ever been ghosted can attest, the absence of an answer can be a shock that leads to obsessive rumination. Mauro Oliveira, his former massage therapist, said Richard’s longtime housekeeper, Teresa Reveles, was controlling him through witchcraft – Richard denied this in a radio interview. He sued the National Enquirer when it said he was transitioning to female. Rumours abounded that a knee injury had sunk him into depression. The podcast Missing Richard Simmons, released in 2017 by Dan Taberski (such a devoted attendee of class that he had dined at Richard’s home), tried to uncover what happened, but it didn’t, as had been Taberski’s hope, cause Richard to appear. Richard’s brother, Lenny, eventually spoke to Taberski, saying he sees him at holidays and he just wants to be left alone. “Is he happy and healthy?” Lenny paused: “Happy is a hard word to describe. There’s nothing going on medically”.Two things troubled Richard followers: that, having given us so much, he deserves goodness and kindness; and that having offered us goodness and kindness, he ought not so suddenly switch it off. When I got married and my husband would go through periods of not talking to me, I would follow him from room to room, pleading, “What is it, what is it? What did I do, please tell me?” I’d insist he share what was bothering him. He felt persecuted by my concern and I felt abused by his silence.That time he came to Richard’s class, a lady started filming us for one of the gym’s promotional videos. Realising this, Ben, who’d been participating with enthusiasm, said, “No I can’t be filmed, I’m a villain in a Batman movie,” and tried to sneak out. But Richard saw him leave, and shape-shifted to my side. “What’s he doing?” I tried to explain: “He’s a villain in a Batman movie that’s coming out and…” Richard’s face fell and the rat-a-tat shriek of his voice seemed to sink through molasses. He was crushed. As if overweight women romantically idolising you when you are wearing an outfit made from sporks meant you were a joke.Something I liked about Richard’s classes was that his actual exercises were basic and repetitive, jumping jacks and push-ups. I think their quotidian nature, in contrast to his eccentricity, helped foster stability, the way doing household chores can free your mind of worry. What I’d suffered with, before I found the right psychiatrist and medication, and committed to exercise, was rapid-cycle manic depression. It would change in an hour and sometimes a half hour. Ecstatic joy and optimism and crashing despair and then back again. Projecting my own difficulties, as all audiences do to their favourite stars, the possibility occurred to me that Richard might have been having a decades-long manic fit. Do you know how hard it is to be crazy and then have a window of insight that you are not well? All the things I did when I was manic felt so wonderful when I was doing them. Mania was the superhero me. The comedowns were the prison.Gym bunnies: Emma Forrest with Richard Simmons. Photograph: Courtesy of Emma ForrestThere is only one harbinger I can see when I look through his public record. In 2004, Richard had slapped a man at Phoenix Airport who’d said: “Hey everyone it’s Richard Simmons! Let’s drop our luggage and rock to the 50s!” I remembered how, one time, when they wouldn’t give me my medication at the pharmacy because of an insurance issue, how badly I’d lost it in public. It was the Britney Spears 24-hour pharmacy in the Valley, the one that she’d go to in the wee hours after she’d been driving around all night.Britney also likes to post exercise videos now she’s “free”. If there’s anxiety you cannot bear to carry inside your body, working out can stave it off. But only while you’re in it. Richard had the lightest touch, the only exercise guru who did it with humour and self-deprecation. No one knows what he looks like now, in his mansion, behind the newly gated drive.I went with my whole family back to class two days before my wedding. Ben came back in to say hello at the end and made it right with Richard. I knew things were right because Richard kept coming up in his face and screaming “Remember to brush your teeth before the ceremony!” And making the tooth-brushing gesture across the room whenever he caught his eye.One of my best friends cut ties with me 10 years ago. He never told me why and I turned it over in my head endlessly. Recently, when I prodded her, a wise mutual friend told me, in a very kind way, why: my ex-friend didn’t think writers should publish memoirs. It bothered him that I had. It didn’t matter that I held myself accountable, the act of recounting these things in public without distilling them through the lens of imagination was, he felt, beneath me as an artist. That’s interesting, I thought. I don’t agree but that’s an answer! I felt a lot better.Once Richard was gone, I worked with other instructors at new studios, some totally different – Marnie, so beautiful and ethereal, Audrey, an adorable tomboy Jock – and some too similar, like Hector, who would scream “SHAKE YOUR BOOBS!” – only it rang hollow, somehow.If Richard came down from the hill, he’d see a lot of LA is boarded up post-pandemic, coyotes roam the streets in packs during the day, the homeless are thrown away. Katy Perry won the legal action. One of the nuns died in court during a hearing. Why does Katy want a convent? We all want elevation wherever we can get it, from the vast California sky, or from a cramped exercise class.The most important thing I learned from Richard Simmons is you can be ridiculous and significant, silly and a spiritual guide. Back in London, post-divorce, I sometimes watch Sweatin’ To The Oldies on YouTube. I am not old, but old enough that when I am stressed or sad it manifests in my body. My now ex-husband and I can go long periods without talking before texting each other out-of-context song lyrics from our youth as proof of life. I want to talk to my beloved therapist, the one who used to chat dream theory. But he is one of many healers who was so badly affected by the isolation of Covid that he quit his work and left town. His patients sometimes text him, just to tell him what he meant to us. He doesn’t reply. But we can, at least, see that the messages have been read.Emma Forrest’s memoir Busy Being Free (Weidenfeld & Nicolson, £9.99) is out in paperback this weekTopicsFitnessThe ObserverLos AngelesfeaturesReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedFashionFoodRecipesLove & sexHome & gardenHealth & fitnessFamilyTravelMoneyNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

And more may be to come as new developments in tech come ever thicker and faster.“They’re torturing themselves now, which is kind of fun to see. They’re afraid that their little AIs are going to come for them. They’re apocalyptic, and so existential, because they have no connection to real life and how things work. They’re afraid the AIs are going to be as mean to them as they’ve been to us,” Rushkoff told The Guardian in an interview.In his most recent book, last year’s Survival of the Richest: Escape Fantasies of the Tech Billionaires, Rushkoff strung together a series of observations about the tech elite, often gleaned from his may encounters at conferences and private lectures with them.Rushkoff said that he believes that the tech billionaires are in escape mode – planning missions to Mars, creating island bunkers or moving to higher ground – in the event of “The Event”( code for catastrophic climate collapse) and by creating a virtual “metaverse”, fulfilling the prophecy that the tech revolution was always about preparing us for a world in which it was no longer possible to go outside.For them, the future of technology is about only one thing: escape from the rest of usHe’s called this “The Mindset” – an analysis of the way Silicon Valley technocrats think. “For them, the future of technology is about only one thing: escape from the rest of us” he wrote in the book’s opening pages. “They’ve reduced technological progress to a video game that one of them wins by finding an escape hatch.”He cites a grim list of examples by way of illustration: Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos pursuing space migration fantasies; Peter Thiel’s New Zealand compound; Mark Zuckerberg’s digital universe and others pursuing technologies toward longevity, cloning and those creating large, multiple partner families.The problem with this behavior, Rushkoff points out, is that it does not and will not work.“They’re not getting off the planet, they’re not going to live forever. They’re just living out their fantasies. They are eugenicists. There’s a reason why they got along with Jeffrey Epstein and Richard Dawkins – people who say genes are the only things that matter, we live in an entirely material universe, there is no soul, humans can be auto-tuned and anything between the ones and zeros is just noise,” he said.Rushkoff continued: “It’s a pure form of the same sort of sociopathic capitalism that we saw from the British East India Company or Hobbs talking about Native Americans. But now they have a technology that amplifies sociopathic tendencies.”To Rushkoff, author of seven books on new media and popular culture, including Cyberia: Life in the Trenches of Hyperspace in 1994, government warnings of the kind seen last week about social media are belated.“What happened to the cigarette companies will eventually happen to the social media companies,” he predicts. “They’ve had all the research for 20 years, and they’ve been knowingly saying this stuff is not harmful when they know it to be harmful.”At the same time, he’s noticed that gen Z may have a less pathological relationship to technology – their phones – than millennials or their parents. Talk to kids and you discover that “their only problem with phones is that their parents are on them too much and don’t make eye contact”.Rushkoff’s renunciations are not new. The gen X techno-optimist was, at one time, a proponent of decentralization, crypto-currency, file-sharing and other technologies initially hailed as disruptive and corrective to the old order. But alongside some benefits, they have also produced extremism, secrecy, environmental damage and fraud.What happened to the cigarette companies will eventually happen to the social media companiesWith a new tech revolution in the works in the form of AI, cyber-futurism is looking even less palatable. And its proponents and leading figures are looking less free information revolutionaries and more like reactionary capitalist moguls.Elon Musk’s decision to platform Florida governor Ron DeSantis on Twitter, notwithstanding the glitches, was significant in confirming Musk’s alignment with Republicans. The direction of political travel for the tech lords was apparent four years ago when Zuckerberg and Thiel had dinner at the White House with Donald Trump.But Rushkoff isn’t a fan of the surgeon general’s warnings, either, swathed in worried concern.“They often come off as controlled, restrained and in favor of slowing down the wheels of progress. It often comes off with a squeamish, hand-wringing, pearl-clutching tone. It’s not that it’s just unattractive. It’s infantilizing and it doesn’t help anybody. I want to become Musk-ian myself at that point. It’s like, ‘Fuck it, fine!’”The solution to the modern world’s explosion of tech challenges, he argues, is not government, but in personal choices and responsibility.The only way to rebel is to be human and aware, Rushkoff says. “Be social, get your feet on the ground, make eye contact, have sex, meet people, breathe the air. The more real-life ballast you have, the less this brittle, ideological, abstracted, social media-mediated universe bears upon your daily existence.”TopicsArtificial intelligence (AI)Elon MuskMark ZuckerbergSilicon ValleyJeff BezosComputinginterviewsReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedUSWorldEnvironmentSoccerUS PoliticsBusinessTechScienceNewslettersFight for democracyNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Photograph: Amy Sussman/WireImageObserver New Review Q&ASuccessionInterview‘Brian Cox can be frightening!’: Peter Friedman on the thrill of playing Succession’s FrankMichael HoganThe man behind the Waystar Royco exec on the highs, the frights and the best insults from the hit drama, whose final episode is just about to air – plus who he’d like to see come out on topSun 28 May 2023 04.30 EDTNew York-born character actor Peter Friedman, 74, made his name in theatre, where he was Tony award-nominated for Ragtime in 1998. His TV roles include The Affair and The Marvelous Mrs Maisel, while film credits include Single White Female, Safe, She Said and Synecdoche, New York. He currently plays Waystar Royco vice-chair Frank Vernon in hit HBO drama Succession, which is about to reach its feature-length finale.How are you feeling about the Succession finale?It was a golden era for us actors and everybody who worked on it. It was a good, good time and this last season has been wonderfully riveting, so we’re leaving on a high.Will you watch the episode when it airs?Oh yeah. I want to see how the script emerges into a drama. We read it, shoot it, then somehow it all becomes a new version that’s crackling. Getting to see what’s in and what’s out of the final cut is always fun. I expect we’ll be texting one another.What do you think the viewer reaction will be?I’m fascinated to find out. I sometimes look at Reddit and, let me tell you, people are on the right track. The darts are all over the board but they’ve been narrowing it down to what’s actually going to happen.How have you handled all the secrecy around the series?When you think of all those extras at Logan’s funeral or Connor’s wedding, it’s amazing nothing leaked. Some fans online zoomed in on the order-of-service from the funeral – I think Sarah [Snook, who plays Shiv] had it in her hand – and it said “Ewan Roy” [Logan’s brother]. They did indeed print up a bunch of decoys to put people off. I even kept his death secret from my wife until I inadvertently mentioned something funny that happened in Norway. She said: “Wait, is Logan dead?” When Harriet Walter [who plays Logan’s ex-wife Lady Caroline] came in for the funeral episode, she saw all the black clothes and said: “Who died?” It had even been kept secret from her.Who would you choose as Logan’s successor?I’m so enamoured by what Alexander Skarsgård is doing [as Lukas Matsson]. His acting is so beautiful – blithe and confident yet anxious – I’d go for him. As a viewer I’d say: “These kids aren’t up to it.” I think Frank wishes Kendall would quit and become a musician somewhere. Please, get out of here and go live a peaceful life! He just wants to see them happy, which probably isn’t going to happen.Brian Cox is frightening when he gets up into high dudgeon. I don’t mean just acting frightening, I mean actually frighteningFrank is Kendall’s godfather and an avuncular figure. What’s it like working with Jeremy Strong?We did an off-Broadway play together a few years ago – I played his dad, in fact – and I find him the sweetest guy. I’m always glad to shoot scenes with him. There’s a natural warmth there.Your character’s become a cult hero. How much do you get recognised?It depends on the day and what area of the city I’m in. There’s a high recognition rate walking around the university areas and there’s always more the day after it airs. But it’s always swell. One guy shouted “Frank!” from a car last week. Usually, it’s: “Aren’t you the guy off Succession?”Frank and Karl, played by David Rasche, have become a great double act…Isn’t Dave cool? I’m so impressed by what he does. We go way back. We were never up for the same parts – I was more Jewish in my youth, he was more Waspy – but we’ve been at the same parties for decades. There’s history and chemistry there. He’s a gregarious storyteller. I’m not but it really works.They’re often joined by Gerri. How is working with J Smith-Cameron?Again, we’ve known each other for decades, so to finally work with her is a wonderful thing. I’m going to miss that. We’re trying to make a martini date to catch up.Friedman with J Smith-Cameron (Geri Kellman) and Jeremy Strong (Kendall Roy) in the first series of Succession. Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamyThe Waystar exec team have been called the village elders, greybeards, boiled eggs…Emperor penguins. Ancient grains. I even had Sir Talky of Fuckchester thrown at me. I loved that.What did you make of the Frank character when you first got the role?Before the pilot episode, I was like: “What’s a COO?” For research, I found a real COO and we had a nice conversation for 45 minutes. Then, at the end of the pilot, I was fired as COO. What have I been since? Because Frank was in league with Kendall for a takeover, I think Logan was just keeping his enemies close. When the dust settles, I’m going to ask Jesse [Armstrong] exactly what I did in the company.What’s it like being repeatedly told to fuck off by Brian Cox?He’s frightening when he gets up into high dudgeon. I don’t mean just acting frightening, I mean actually frightening. He can get there! But he’s also the nicest guy in the world.Roman Roy openly loathes Frank. What’s it like being adversarial with Kieran Culkin?As Frank, I’m offended sometimes, but as Peter, it’s fun. Certain bits aren’t scripted. After some two-line spat, Kieran will throw a champagne cork at me. I’m like: “Ow, fuck, that’s not in any script.” But it’s perfect. Kieran has been so hot this season.‘We can almost think that Frank might be a good person’: Peter Friedman as Frank in Succession. Photograph: HBOFrank’s often been a Roy family punchbag, forever fired and rehired. Why does he stick around?Exactly my question! If he’s the only one we haven’t seen commit heinous crimes, we can almost think that Frank might be a good person. So why is he with these sharks? Why doesn’t he join a non-profit and spread good if he’s so damn moral?Did the yachts, mansions and private jets give you a taste for the high life?No, I don’t like responsibility. I’d be too busy worrying about how to keep up with paying for it all. I’m going to miss a payment, I know it, and the jet’s gone! When we went to foreign countries, Fisher Stevens [who plays Hugo] was our maître d’. He’s been everywhere, done everything and knows all the restaurants, so he’d get us together for dinner.My favourite Frank line is when he called Kendall “the Calamari Cock Ring”.That’s right! [laughs] I didn’t know what that meant but it was funny. I guess it means a cock ring made of calamari.Karl’s buying a Greek island. What’s Frank’s retirement plan?I’ve gotten so few clues from the writers. When they joked about him having a girlfriend in Italy who was seen giving a blow job to somebody else, was that just an office haze or for real? Sometimes I think the audience knows more about Frank than me.Was your last day of shooting emotional?More wistful, because it’s been so good. Everybody’s star has risen. There’s been a degree of excellence that one should be wistful about, because I don’t know how soon each of us will find it again.Frank and Karl have been compared to Statler and Waldorf. Weren’t you a Muppeteer in the late 70s?Yes. I’ve done right hands for a lot of famous puppets. I never touched those guys but I can see the resemblance.Weren’t you also Mr Snuffleupagus on Sesame Street?Only half of him. I was the back end, the business end, although you have the easier gig because you’re not doing the mouth movements to Jerry Nelson’s voiceover. It’s sweaty work inside Snuffy but as a 28-year-old making $50 per shot, it was all worth it.How do you relax when you’re not working?Over the past three years, I’ve got into silent movies – partly so I can watch them in bed and won’t disturb my wife. I also read the classics I’ve never got around to. Right now, I’m on The Haunted Hotel by Wilkie Collins.What’s your next dream project?Maybe something on stage. The first four decades of my career seemed extremely slow, with lots of unemployed time. The past 20 years have been a pleasant surprise. Being Frank was a wonderful experience, but it’s important to shake it up a bit. To feel like you’re fluid, greased up and ready to go. It’s stupid but I’d love to do something interacting with puppets. With me on the outside this time. Less sweaty.What will you miss most about Succession?The overall excellence and lovely people.

Here, she shares what shifted her perspective – and explains why older women are no longer invisibleSaskia SarginsonSun 28 May 2023 07.00 EDTI hate having my picture taken. As soon as the lens finds me, I freeze. I’m not part of the selfie generation. I’m old school. I don’t document my every move with photographic evidence of me living my best life, my face angled just so to catch the light. As soon as someone whips out an iPhone, I frown and duck.So, it’s odd that on this grey London day I’m sitting in a studio looking down a large lens with several people gathered behind it, scrutinising the real me, and then looking at the frighteningly large image of me appearing on a screen behind the camera, whispering about what they see and pointing at parts of my face.A year ago, while walking my dogs in my local park, a young woman approached me with a business card. “I’d like you to join my modelling agency,” she said. “Who? Me?” I said, aware that I was over 60, dressed in muddy jeans with no makeup on and dirty hair. “Er… I don’t think so,” I told her.“I’m a granny,” I added, as if that explained everything. But it turns out older faces are in demand. My wrinkles could actually earn me money.It turns out that being over 60 and a granny and a model are not mutually exclusiveAfter a few minutes of existential angst I decided that – hell, yes, I could. I’d be mad to turn down the chance of what seemed to me at the time to be free money. The life of an author (unless they go by the title of JK Rowling) is very similar to the myth of the scribe in the garret, hunched over a flickering candle, pen in hand, hunger snapping at the door. There’s not really a living wage in it, which is why most writers, including me, supplement it with whatever they can get their hands on: teaching, editing, journalism. So why not modelling? I’m not proud, I thought, if they want me for a chairlift ad, I’ll do it.But as with all things that seem too good to be true, it was. The journey from being handed the card to the studio in London was not a speedy one. Part of the problem was that I went off to castings dragging impostor syndrome with me. As soon as I walked in the door, words of apology spilled out of my mouth. “I’m not really a model,” I’d confess to the receptionist, casting agent, or anyone who’d listen: “I’m a granny.” And I’d get up photos of the cherubic child on my screen to prove it. I felt that if I got it in first, it would save everyone the embarrassment of having to explain that I wasn’t wanted. Because, obviously, I was too old.I felt ridiculous, standing on a taped X in a dark room, being asked to repeat the same line over and over, about how fabulous my hair looked now that I’d used a particular product, which I’d been directed to show to the camera while expressing extreme joy. “Could you hold the tube the right way up, love?” “Could you not cover the name with your hand?” “Could you do that all over again without blinking?” Holding a tube up and smiling at the same time is surprisingly difficult.I got “heavy pencilled”, for jobs – a good thing. But the actual jobs themselves eluded me. My impostor syndrome grew garrulous – see, told you, you’re not a model, you’re a wrinkly fraud.“I’m not really a model,” I’d confess to the receptionist, casting agent, or anyone else who’d listenI won’t pretend that the rejections didn’t hurt, even if my impostor syndrome was lapping them up. Criticism and rejection are part of my day job. But there’s only so much of it a person can take.Still, I persisted; the thought of all that lovely cash and not wanting to disappoint my agent, spurring me on. Since the pandemic, lots of auditions are self-taped. And thank goodness for that, because embarrassment and self-respect are checked at the door while following instructions like: stare at a pretend dog and cry! Dance like nobody’s looking! Tell a funny story and bring lots of energy! My facial tics were scary on that one.And then came a live audition in which I had half my face painted in heavy-duty foundation. I felt quite glamorous while the makeup artist was dabbing away at my skin – but a quick glance in the loo mirror told me I looked like an unfinished ancient geisha girl.But I got the job. A real beauty job advertising makeup. As they didn’t let me know until the day before, I’d presumed it was another “no” and eaten my bodyweight in chocolate over the weekend. But they didn’t care about my spare tyre; they just wanted my face, wrinkles and all.Tell a funny story and bring lots of energy! My facial tics were scary on that oneThe job entailed having more makeup applied than I thought possible – all manner of bronzers and blushers and highlighters – and then false eyelashes, and black stuff inside my eyes, something called “top lining” I discovered. My reflection in the mirror peered back at me, a bit blurry without my glasses, but, wow, I thought, who knew what makeup could do?When my hair and makeup had been finished, an assistant handed me what appeared to be a white handkerchief: “You all right wearing this?” she asked airily.“What, you mean this belt?”“It’s a boob tube,” she explained, helpfully.The reply that crossed my mind was, “Honey, if I was a stone thinner and 30 years younger, maybe.” But out loud I tried for a more subtle, “Um. You know. Er. It’s not really… me.” We compromised on a flesh-coloured vest to be touched out later.Positioned on a stool close to the camera, I tried to remember the “smize” thing, smiling with your eyes, that I’d heard about on a reality TV programme. It’s quite hard to do under a tonne of makeup that’s making your eyeballs feel as if they’ve been rolled in vinegar. But I tried. My image popped up on a huge screen every time the photographer pressed the button. I could just glimpse myself on it – the expanse of my features magnified and then examined by three makeup artists, a hairdresser, the woman from the company, her assistant, the photographer and his assistant. They huddled over every shot, discussing in urgent whispers, then some of them would rush over and do things to me. At one point I had three people attending to my eyebrows with great concentration. It took at least 15 minutes.At one point I had three people attending to my eyebrows with great concentration. It took at least 15 minutesMy impostor syndrome took over, of course, especially when they were considering my face and frowning. They’re wondering how to tell you to go home, the voice in my head sneered. They’ve booked you by mistake. But I got to the end of the day, and everyone had been kind and treated me like a professional. They removed my makeup and I left, feeling elated that I’d got away with it. Nobody realised I wasn’t a model, I thought in amazement, as I cycled away.It turns out that being over 60 and a granny and a model are not mutually exclusive. After all, a model just means to represent something, so why not older women? The UK population is an ageing one, with more than 15.5 million people aged 50 and over. I don’t think that including older models (known as “mature”, as in cheese, or “classic”, as in car) is just a cynical move to pander to the Grey Pound – although that must be part of the strategy. I’m hopeful that it’s also a genuine recognition that women past childbearing age are not redundant. My own insecurities about my drooping jowls and crows-feet come from growing up in a world where young, wrinkle-free women with perfect features were held up as the only image worth aspiring to, the only look that had any value. But public perception changes over time and our understanding of identity has become more complex than ever before. Older women, once considered undesirable hags who should stay hidden, are finally being recognised and seen. Our wrinkles are proof that we’ve lived, learned, suffered, grieved, celebrated, and loved. They are marks of wisdom, strength and experience. We can shrug off the embarrassment that plagues younger people. “Who cares what anyone else thinks?” is something I hear my older friends say all the time. And that mindset gives freedom. We’ve often been perceived as a threat precisely because we’re not going to stay quiet and behave.Being asked to work as a model thrust me into a world where looks seemed to be the only currency that counted. I had to remind myself that I was representing my age group, not pretending to be 20, or even 40. Older women are a powerful force; they do so many important things, from providing childcare for grandchildren and volunteering to being CEOs and professionals of all kinds. We may not care about making fools of ourselves, but we do care about our health, looks and lives; we are a valuable part of our families, communities and, yes, the marketplace. We are not invisible.So, count me in; I’m up for modelling jobs – be it an ad for a chairlift or a faceful of makeup. But, if anybody wants me to wear a white boob tube, sorry, that won’t be happening.Seven Months of Summer by Saskia Sarginson is published by Piatkus, priced at £14.99TopicsModelsThe ObserverAgeingfeaturesReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedFashionFoodRecipesLove & sexHome & gardenHealth & fitnessFamilyTravelMoneyNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

She’s somewhere out of sight in the kitchen of her Paris flat, and all I can see on my laptop is a vividly coloured glass partition – a Mondrian pattern of rectangles in rich shades of red and orange. Then suddenly the French actor comes into view, greeting me with a big “All-ôôô!”, so perkily singsong that the English equivalent would have to be “Coo-eee!”I like the panel, I tell her. “I found it in a little shop where I used to live,” she says. “I’m crazy about glassworks and those colours. I found this, et hop …!” – she bought it. You can imagine Calamy’s best-known character, Noémie Leclerc from the hit Netflix series Call My Agent!, buying something similar in a burst of enthusiasm: et hop! With her ebullient energy, fast, throaty delivery and her dress style today – green leopard-print top, big hoop earrings – you might easily assume that Calamy and her TV character are a very close match.Certainly, Calamy plays Noémie with such relaxed exuberance that it feels an effortless creation. Her role as the frazzled staffer in a top Paris talent agency made Calamy a universally recognised face after two decades in French film and TV. And the success of Call My Agent! has launchedher into a series of ever-more prominent big-screen roles, some considerably more heavyweight than her TV image as an insouciant farceuse may suggest. Now being feted with big acting awards, Calamy, 48, has emerged as something like France’s answer to Olivia Colman – an approachable screen presence who seemed always to have been around, inspiring widespread affection, then suddenly bursting into the limelight as a formidable talent whose moment was long overdue.Watch a trailer for Full Time.She plays the lead in Éric Gravel’s Full Time, which was released last week in the UK – a realist drama about work stress that also works brilliantly as a race-against-the-clock nail-biter. Calamy won the 2021 Orizzonti best actress award at the Venice film festival for her role as Julie, a highly qualified market researcher who, divorced with two children, works as a chambermaid in a high-end Paris hotel. Much of the film involves Julie racing to and from work, while surreptitiously attending job interviews, the ante raised by city-wide transport strikes: “I think it’s pretty clear that this film is not against strikes,” Calamy cautions.Indeed, Full Time is a very political film about the tribulations of earning a living, notably in jobs that bring little prestige yet involve high degrees of professionalism. Calamy took a crash course training in luxury hotels to perfect her technique and movements: “Like changing a bed very fast, making it excellent. It’s a whole choreography, and seeing the rhythm those women work at, it’s dazzling.”She was attracted to Full Time partly because a friend was a union official who supported Paris hotel staff fighting for better conditions. “The jobs are subcontracted out and these women are paid by the room – so all the time they spend going from floor to floor, none of that is taken into account. It’s extremely hard physical work – you see women who have been doing it for 15, 20 years, and they have tendinitis, back problems, all kinds of issues.”Noémie’s character grew and I grew with her. She helped me feel a lot more confident myselfIn its own way, Call My Agent! is also about the realities of work, with its demystifying picture of French showbusiness as an everyday, often desk-bound hustle. Calamy’s role as Noémie began as frothy comic support, but with time developed very differently. “Someone said to me: ‘Oh, Noémie’s a bit nunuche” – “ditzy” may be the best translation – “but I wouldn’t see her that way. Not when you discover her depth.”In season two, Noémie embarks on a very workplace-inappropriate romance with agency boss Mathias, and emerges gradually as a force of nature, intensely sexual and much cannier than anyone suspected. “What I liked was that it starts out with a cliche – the boss and the assistant – and then it’s flipped over. At the start, the fragility’s all on her side, but then she starts to put herself forward, and emerge as a desirable and desiring person, and a thinking one.” Calamy owes Noémie a lot, she says: “Over four seasons, she took on more and more substance – she grew, and I grew with her. She helped me feel a lot more confident myself.”Calamy grew up near Orléans; her mother was a psychologist, her father a hospital doctor. She got the acting bug, or the clowning bug, early. “I don’t remember this, but apparently my mother took me to the circus when I was four, and I said: ‘I want to be a circus lady!’”Her comedy roles allow her to be that – in a way. She won the best actress award at France’s Césars with a film that highlights the broader end of her range, but with an uneasy emotional undertow: 2020’s My Lover, My Donkey & I. Not nearly as louche as the English title suggests – in French, it’s Antoinette dans les Cévennes – it’s a sort of anti-romcom about a woman who goes donkey trekking in the southern French mountain region to stalk her married lover. Calamy knows the Cévennes well: she spends time there with her Colombian partner, who is a mountain guide. “He has a little mazet,” – a small, very basic rural house – “no water, no electricity, very rudimentary.”Left to right: Nicolas Maury, Laure Calamy and Amélie Etasse. Call My Agent!. Photograph: FTV-Monvoisin Production-Mother ProductionsDespite Calamy’s comic forte, her reasons for taking on projects are often highly serious, as witness Full Time. “The directors I choose to work with are ones with a political viewpoint,” she says. Hence, leads in two recent dramas with strong feminist themes (Calamy is a member of Le Collectif 50/50, the organisation for gender equality in French cinema). In Angry Annie, she played a woman who becomes an activist for abortion rights in the 1970s; in Her Way, a sex worker whose trade is presented in matter-of-fact terms, just daily life for a single mother out to earn a living. Her Way is about women who opt for sex work as a free choice, says Calamy: “The ones who say: ‘I’d rather do this than pack shrimps in a factory all day long.’”Decidedly anglophile in her cinematic tastes, Calamy loves Ken Loach: “There’s something epic, something really Brechtian about his films.” She also adores Peter Greenaway’s The Cook, the Thief, His Wife & Her Lover (“Extra-ordinaire! Extra-ordinaire! It’s like Dante’s Inferno!” she enthuses, wide-eyed). And then there’s an all but forgotten 1993 drama called Anchoress, which she has seen four times: “Totally hardcore art cinema,” she says. It’s a medieval drama in which Toyah Willcox plays the mother of a girl who aspires to sainthood: “You’ve got the daughter, who’s very mystical, while her mother is this hyper-liberated woman who pisses in front of the church. I identified with both of them!”Since we spoke, Calamy has been confirmed as the lead in a new French HBO series about the real-life case of a woman who falsely claimed to have been a victim of the Paris Bataclan attacks. Before that, UK viewers can look forward to Sébastien Marnier’s film The Origin of Evil, a definite departure for her. A very black comedy thriller, it stars Calamy as a factory worker who gets entangled with a snake pit of a moneyed family. “You could definitely say that [Sébastien] wanted to get away from anything you know about me,” Calamy says. “The sunny, sporty, flamboyant characters. He wanted to take that image and mess with it – dirty it up,” she says with a big, appropriately dirty laugh.Her last few films suggest that we have only just begun to get a sense of what Calamy can do in lead roles. Full Time director Gravel tells me: “She always says: ‘Women get good roles in their 40s, but I know it won’t last.’ I don’t agree – I think we’re going to see her on screen for a long time. She has this energy which was just waiting for the right moment.”Full Time, which features Calamy pretty permanently in fevered constant motion, feels perfectly tuned to her particular dynamism. “I loved all the running. I need to let off steam physically – I have too much energy at times. People usually ask me to walk slower – so let’s say this film corresponded to my rhythm.” From here on, Calamy can expect to set her own pace and cinema will just have to keep up with her.
Full Time is in UK cinemas; The Origin of Evil is released later this year

Photograph: © Tate/Madeleine BuddoTate Britain’s rehang: predictable and dull? Photograph: © Tate/Madeleine BuddoThe ObserverTate BritainThe challenge of rehangs: galleries wrestle with changing politics of artA reshuffle of Tate Britain’s collections has led to it being accused of reducing art to social historyVanessa ThorpeSun 28 May 2023 07.00 EDTEveryone has a favourite. For some it might be John Singer Sargent’s luminous 1885-6 image of two young girls hanging paper lanterns in a summer evening garden. Well, don’t worry, despite all the fuss about Tate Britain’s radical reorganisation, that pretty painting is still on the wall of the popular London art gallery.Detractors of the big new rehang, such as the Guardian art critic Jonathan Jones, are accusing the gallery of instructing art lovers what to think, while others, in contrast, are praising curators for shaking up conventional views of British art and what it can show us.One thing is certain, though: a collection built up on the wealth of a colonial sugar merchant, and with a low proportion of women artists on show, had to find a fresh story to tell. So now, while Singer Sargent’s well-to-do girls in their white summer dresses are still there, another striking lantern picture has joined the parade. Marianne Stokes’s 1899 work, A Fisher Girl’s Light (A Pilgrim of Volendam Returning from Kevelaer), depicts a workaday scene in a poor girl’s life from a female artist’s perspective. What is more, the gallery is now boasting that, overall, half the contemporary works on show are by women.A Fisher Girl’s Light (A Pilgrim of Volendam returning from Kevelaer) by Marianne Stokes, 1899. Photograph: Seraphina Neville/TateThe Tate rehang is one of a wave of important changes going on inside European and American art galleries and museums, as the heritage world shifts to reflect a wider range of contributors and address the glaring prejudices of the past. At the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, focus has moved over from Spanish master Diego Velázquez to the work of his enslaved Afro-Hispanic assistant, Juan de Pareja, an artist until now known largely only for the portrait painted of him. “The Met’s purchase of Velázquez’s painting in 1971 made headlines at the time, but scholars and the press said practically nothing about the man depicted,” said David Pullins, associate curator in the museum’s department of European paintings, when the show opened last month.And at the Hunterian, the London surgical museum, a recent rethink has altered its displays of anatomical oddities. The notorious Irish Giant, the huge skeleton of Charles Byrne, has been removed after 200 years, and is now only glimpsed in the background of a portrait of Hunter, the man who bestowed the collection. From this autumn the museum is also to run a string of “Hunterian Provocations” designed “to explore issues around the display of human remains and the acquisition of specimens during British colonial expansion”.Major museum rehangs, together with swings in emphasis, have always been staged periodically of course, sometimes controversially, but the decisions being taken now are inevitably seen in the light of the “culture wars”: the new ethical battles being waged even though no one claims to want to fight them.The Financial Times welcomed the rehang of the Tate’s free-to-view collection, but noted that the result “defiantly claims art as primarily social and political history”. And among gallery visitors the debate also seems to centre on how blunt the social arguments should be. For Joy Francis, executive director of Words of Colour and co-curator of the Museum of Colour, a direct approach is a good thing. “Any attempt to redress inequity in arts and culture will get my attention,” she said. “I’m glad Tate Britain has taken the steps to reflect artists of colour in its rehang and hope they will continue to step into the future embracing the reality of intersectionality.“But it’s also about what happens beyond the exhibition space in terms of Tate’s culture, approach to curation, commissioning and acquisition, which I hope will undergo its own radical revisioning and internal interrogation, so we hear different, bolder and less apologetic conversations about who is and isn’t being represented in the art world.”Perhaps the most arresting changes at the Tate are the mini-interventions. Works by living artists have been dotted among the paintings from the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries, to highlight particular ideas and connections. A sculpture by Mona Hatoum points up the contribution of migrant and refugee artists in Tudor Britain, while a drawing by Pablo Bronstein deliberately “resurfaces” the existence of queer communities in Georgian London.For Jones, writing last week, the Tate’s “worthy” efforts flow from the right set of principles but are “predictable and dull”. “To try to pretend it still matters, Tate Britain ostentatiously ‘rehangs’ its collection every few years,” he wrote. “Not a single such rehang has ever made a convincing, coherent case for British art – and the latest is no exception. Maybe it doesn’t want to promote British art, for it seems to disapprove of much of it.”The use of Bronstein’s modern treatment of molly houses to set a new context for Georgian work is a clear abuse for Jones: “What, for instance, has Tate Britain got against William Hogarth’s pungent 18th-century satires that it has to ‘correct’ them with a contemporary piece by Pablo Bronstein celebrating Georgian London’s molly houses?” he asked.The Gate of Calais (also known as O the Roast Beef of Old England) by William Hogarth, 1748 Photograph: GL Archive/AlamyIt was, however, Hogarth’s 1748 painting, O the Roast Beef of Old England, which still held the attention of renowned historian and television presenter Simon Schama at a preview last week. Reserving judgment on the whole rehang, he pointed out the resonant nationalist politics on display in the famous image of The Gate of Calais, with its traditional side of beef apparently at the mercy of hungry Frenchmen and sympathisers, while Hogarth himself looks on.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Art WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But Jones is concerned that artists with something blatantly political to say are now being preferred to those with more oblique attitudes. He argues the newly included work of British women’s rights campaigner Annie Swynnerton, while laudable, is not groundbreaking art.Any rehang questions the purpose of a gallery: is it most important to offer challenging perspectives, to accurately represent the world, or to showcase freewheeling talent? Such rival priorities are contested as much within the art world as by gallery-goers and probably always will be.Looking at the past through the eyes of the present is a perfectly reasonable thing to doTim Marlow, Design MuseumWhat we do get in the Tate rehang is a clear chronology. Not just in the progression of British art, but in an explicit timeline high on the wall of one gallery. The Grenadian uprising against British rule is marked up, nine years before the Battle of Trafalgar and 11 before the 1807 British ban on the trading of enslaved people.Tim Marlow, chief executive of the Design Museum, is a fan of the Tate’s latest exhibitions and regardsit as natural that the same criteria apply to the permanent collection.“The passion and shrillness of some of the responses just shows that people do still care,” he said. “But looking at the past through the eyes of the present is a perfectly reasonable thing to do. Some inclusions may jar, but anything that makes you look again seems an intelligent thing to do.“The suggestion that it’s hectoring or that the labels are intrusive? Well, not at all. It’s a broadly chronological look and there’s a fluidity in the framework anyway that means that later sections can be added to or taken away from in the future.”TopicsTate BritainThe ObserverArtPaintingSlaveryFeminismfeaturesReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedFilmBooksMusicArt & designTV & radioStageClassicalGamesNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

They flashed two or three packets of what looked like ordinary Malboros or Camels for €5 (£4.35), about half the legal price. “There are so many illegal cigarette sellers near stations, they’re taking over the pavements,” said a customer at a local bakery.The French government has warned of an “explosion” in contraband cigarettes since the Covid lockdowns, as the number of smokers in France remains stable and has even risen among women over 18. Men selling cheap contraband packets near stations in and around Paris, from the Gare du Nord to Barbès or Noisy-le-Sec and La Courneuve, are so commonplace that some residents’ groups deem greater Paris a “giant, open-air, illegal tobacconist’s”.But France’s cigarette wars are a sign of deeper problems running through society. International criminal gangs are putting millions of euros into setting up secret illegal cigarette factories in western Europe and France is a key target market – it has among the highest taxes on cigarettes in the EU with the average price of a pack about €11. At the bottom of the chain, the young men selling a handful of packets on the street – many from Maghreb countries or Afghanistan – are often without legal papers and unable to find other work, vulnerable to gangs and making a tiny profit to survive. Those who buy the cigarettes say they cannot make ends meet so have no choice, despite risking a €135 fine if they are caught purchasing illegal tobacco.More than one-third of cigarettes smoked in France in 2021 were bought illegally, according to KPMG research, funded by the tobacco industry. French authorities seized 600 tonnes of contraband cigarette products in the first 10 months of last year, more than twice the amount captured in 2020.“If there weren’t buyers, there wouldn’t be any sellers; you see all types of people coming here to buy the cigarettes,” said Sandrine, a restaurant worker at a brasserie near Hoche station in Pantin. Her restaurant, offering “couscous every day”, had lost customers who feared cigarette sellers’ turf wars on the pavement outside. “My boss has lost 80% of the turnover on our pavement tables. The sellers think they control the street. I live above the restaurant and I don’t feel safe,” she said.Sandrine, alongside a local pharmacist, baker, estate agents and bookshop staff, held a protest over the cigarette sellers in March. More than 1,500 people signed a petition. The police presence was increased and the sellers decreased but Sandrine said in recent weeks smaller numbers of sellers had returned.People step past cigarette butts littering a pavement in Paris. More than one one-third of cigarettes smoked in France in 2021 were bought illegally, according to research. Photograph: Emmanuel Dunand/AFP/Getty ImagesBertrand Kern, Pantin’s Socialist mayor, said: “It’s a similar mechanism as cannabis – you have apartments where the packets of cigarettes are stocked, and people who deliver them regularly so that the sellers only have three or four packets on them, which means for prosecutors it’s very hard to pursue.”Municipal police arrested 495 cigarette sellers across Pantin in 2021 and 2022 but most were released. Kern said that near Hoche Métro station, the atmosphere had been particularly bad because sellers themselves inhaled nitrous oxide. Asked who was buying the contraband cigarettes, he said: “It’s everyone. I’ve done campaigns to warn about what’s in these counterfeit cigarettes – they’re even more dangerous than real cigarettes – but when a pack sells for €5 or €6 instead of €11, people don’t really hear that health message.”He said a key issue was the international crime groups behind the illicit tobacco trade.A turning point came earlier this year, when gendarmes raided a vast illegal cigarette factory in an abandoned building in a village near Rouen, Normandy. Nine workers, Moldovans and Greeks, aged between 21 and 55, had been housed on camp beds, completely cut off from the outside world. The full production line of machinery was estimated by police to have made 250 cigarettes a minute, labelled as well-known brands. At least 19.4m cigarettes and 15 tonnes of cut tobacco were seized, alongside 50 tonnes of packaging materials including filters and labels. The value was estimated at about €17m on the illegal French market.Europol, the EU police agency, which shared information to trace the Rouen factory, sees illicit tobacco as a key focus in its fight against economic crime. It is working to trace illegal factories across Europe and some are set up in dire conditions. In Spain in 2020, an illegal cigarette factory was found in a bunker 4 metres underground where workers were locked in toxic conditions and criminal bosses made an estimated €625,000 profit a week.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to This is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pivotal stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Setting up an illegal factory can cost a criminal network more than €1m, Bley said. In 2021, Europol detected and reported 74 illegal cigarette factories in the EU, up from 47 in 2018.Bley said criminal groups worked together setting up factories and distribution, but rivalries were common. He said: “They are willing to use violence against each other.”Philippe Alauze, the head of the tobacconists’ federation in Île-de-France, Oise and Seine-Maritime, said the illegal trade was not only crushing independent tobacconists – the only people licensed to sell cigarettes in France – it put minors at risk and was allowing violent crime groups “to map out a territory, with mafia networks setting themselves up in France”.At her independent bookshop near Hoche station, Morgane Payock-Monthé said: “This is about who is illegally occupying the public space. Sometimes there have been so many cigarette sellers, childminders with pushchairs can’t get past. Sometimes the sellers fight, pushing each other up against our windows. It’s becoming difficult for everyone.”TopicsFranceTobacco industrySmokingEuropenewsReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Why won’t Starmer?William KeeganAs every sector counts the mounting cost of our catastrophic break with Europe,  Labour must find its nerveSun 28 May 2023 02.00 EDTWhat do my friends the musicians Sting, John Etheridge and Tom McGuinness (of the Manfreds) have in common, apart from music? They have recently told me they are witnessing first-hand the frustrations of Brexit: loss of the benefits of freedom of movement, and the bureaucratic damage inflicted on one of this country’s widely recognised strengths, namely the creative arts.In this they are joined by most British manufacturers and members of the hospitality industry. These are struggling to find replacements for the EU workers who have been made to feel unwelcome and have been effectively banned, or voted with their feet. All their would-be employers think Brexit is hugely damaging to their respective businesses, and would like to reverse it.Moreover, they cannot understand why the Labour party is being so wet on the issue. One hears the view that Keir Starmer is playing a cautious and clever game. But one also hears the view that, for all the efforts of Starmer and shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves to convince the public that Labour has a vision, this vision is coming across as being somewhat blurred, and mistily confusing.At a time when opinion polls show that clear majorities of respondents think Brexit was a mistake, and one of the prime culprits, the egregious Nigel Farage, admits that “Brexit has failed”, Labour seems terrified of seizing the opportunity of a political lifetime, and simply going for rejoining.Before we continue, it should be noted that, inevitably, Farage blames everyone but himself for the disaster of Brexit, and shows no signs, as yet, of fulfilling his promise to “live abroad” if Brexit proved to be the disaster it indubitably is.The ultimate irony, as the former EU commissioner for competition Mario Monti reminded us in the Financial Times, is that “the benefits of such a successful project [the single market], whose parents were two British politicians (prime minister Margaret Thatcher and commissioner Arthur Cockfield) would eventually be given up by the UK as part of Brexit”.People can no longer blame the EU for their troubles. Years of austerity and neglect are catching up with usI cannot refrain from reminding people of our Brexiter prime minister Rishi Sunak’s Freudian slip in pointing out to the awkward squad in the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist party that by being in the UK and the single market they had the best of both worlds.It is a common refrain that “things are going to pot” and “nothing seems to be working properly” – an exaggeration, perhaps, but an understandable one. But one thing is abundantly clear: people can no longer blame the EU for their troubles. Years of austerity and neglect are catching up with us.Which brings us back to Labour. I commend the view of Trevor Greetham of Royal London: “While there wasn’t a ‘Brexit dividend’ there would certainly be a ‘reversing Brexit’ dividend. Any party coming in to office with a credible promise to join the single market, or ultimately the EU, would be able to base their tax and spending plans on a significantly larger economy with OBR approval” – a reference to the Office for Budget Responsibility’s widely accepted calculation that the macroeconomic cost of Brexit rises to about 4% or £100bn a year.The alternative, says Greetham, is the “austerity mark two” already pencilled in for this government’s plans for public spending should it win the next election.Now, the damage being caused by Brexit is mounting visibly by the day. My two objections to those politicians and columnists who say it will be years before we can rejoin are, first, the damage is guaranteed to intensify when the next stage of the barriers to trade comes into force at the end of this year, and, second, there are still ultra-rightwing Brexiters who are trying to enforce the abandonment of thousands of EU laws, which would make it that much more difficult to negotiate re-entry. So far even Brexiter Sunak has warded them off on most issues, but those ERG fanatics are still hard at it.After the searing experience with the 2016 referendum, people worry about the ghosts that might reappear if there is another. But why bother? Edward Heath seems to be remembered principally for the three-day week of 1973-74 and being brought down by the miners. But he also goes down in history for exercising the leadership to take us into what was then the European Economic Community in 1973 – it was Harold Wilson who held a referendum in 1975 to reconcile the dissidents in the Labour party. Mrs Thatcher did not feel the need to hold a referendum in 1986 when we joined the single market.In my view, Starmer should come out strongly, and soon, for re-entry. He should make it an election issue, while hammering home the mounting costs of a Brexit championed by a failing and totally discredited Conservative-Brexit party.TopicsEconomicsWilliam Keegan's in my viewBrexitLabourEuropeForeign policyEuropean UnionKeir StarmercommentReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedBusinessEconomicsDiversity & equality in businessSmall businessRetailNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Photograph: Pete Still/RedfernsThe ObserverTina TurnerRaw talent and a refusal to accept barriers made Tina Turner greatMaureen MahonShe later became an icon of survival, but fans loved her for the sheer energy she exudedSun 28 May 2023 04.01 EDTLast modified on Sun 28 May 2023 05.12 EDTTina Turner, the trailblazing singer who was hailed as the queen of rock’n’roll, survived so many personal and professional challenges that some of her fans might have believed that she was going to live forever.Her death last week at the age of 83 brought home the fact that she was as mortal as the rest of us, but her refusal to stay in the box that Black women are expected to occupy will remain a lasting source of inspiration.Turner’s musical journey is front of mind to me as a scholar who researches the contributions African American women have made to rock’n’roll. She was a bona fide superstar, the only artist I have written about who has such a high level of name recognition among people who are not pop fans. Indeed, as has become clear in the days since her death, everyone seems to have heard of her. I am fascinated by her ability to have achieved this level of celebrity and the skilful way she mobilised her remarkable vocal talent and riveting stage presence to refuse and resist being consigned to the margins of popular music.Born Anna Mae Bullock in 1939, the young Tina Turner did not have an easy childhood, but she had the capacity to imagine other possibilities and a willingness to work to achieve her dreams. Anna Mae loved singing. She sang in church and sang along with the rhythm and blues (R&B), pop, blues and country music that she heard on the radio when she was growing up in rural Tennessee.When, as a teenager, she saw the Kings of Rhythm she had the audacity to ask the bandleader, Ike Turner, to let her sing with them. Little Ann, as she was known back then, captured audiences in the late 1950s with the urgency of a voice that deployed rough vocal textures, shouts, screams and pure singing power.As the frontwoman for the Ike and Tina Turner Revue during the 1960s and 70s, she became known for a unique combination of energetic vocals and non-stop movement. She and her backing singers, the Ikettes, sang full throttle and performed rapid-fire dance steps; the whirling arms, swinging hair and fringed mini dresses added excitement to the show.Turner wasn’t afraid to be sexy and she wasn’t afraid to sweat. She was a bracing alternative to the controlled and composed style of performance that dominated among Black women during this period.She was a bracing alternative to the controlled and composed style of performance that dominated among Black womenBut she was also seeking a way out of her abusive marriage and professional partnership with Ike Turner. She had attempted suicide – and knew that she had to make a change. Well outside the box of the Christianity she had been raised in, she found in Nichiren Buddhism and the practice of regular chanting a source of strength that enabled her to escape the debilitating existence that was her marriage.Her disclosures about the abuse she suffered during her 16 years with Ike shocked fans, but by leaving him she provided a model for people who were contending with intimate partner abuse. She became an icon of survival, not simply because she left her tormenter but because of the tremendous professional success that she achieved after the split.That success was not preordained. When she started out on her solo career path in the late 1970s, she was working in a recording industry that generally kept African American artists from participating in the lucrative genres of pop and rock. But Turner was tired of singing R&B and determined to move on.In direct opposition to conventional recording industry wisdom, she set her sights on rock, dreaming of large-scale concerts at arenas. It was an uphill battle to convince decision-makers to offer a contract to a Black woman in her 40s who wanted to play a style of music seen as the purview of white youth. Never mind the fact that rock was rooted in African American music. Never mind the fact that she had honed her skills alongside Ike Turner, one of the originators of rock’n’roll.It took about four years to secure the recording contract that led to her 1984 blockbuster Private Dancer. Recorded in London in collaboration with white rockers who were longtime fans, the album delved into the sound of 1980s hard rock and synth pop. By placing Turner’s unmistakable voice in the foreground of songs it sealed her reputation as a versatile rock singer, possibly the best one working at the time.The attitude-rich track What’s Love Got to Do With It gave Turner her first No 1 single and before long she was headlining sold-out concerts at the stadiums that she had dreamed of playing. Grammy awards, more chart-topping recordings, and record-breaking tours followed. She reimagined what a Black woman vocalist could do.Turner escaped domestic violence and circumvented recording industry racism, sexism and ageism. She reinvented herself in her 40s, became a global pop superstar and, after a glorious run, retired from the stage as the undisputed queen of rock’n’roll. She leaves behind recordings and concert footage that showcase the inimitable voice and indomitable spirit that propelled her career and paved the way for artists, especially Black women like Beyoncé and Brittany Howard, who dare to think and do otherwise. Tina Turner’s legacy is her singular reminder of what is possible if you step outside the box.

This time, though, I hope not too widely. I’d be happy if it doesn’t catch the attention of Jacob Rees-Mogg or of government officials.I’m due to give a talk to civil servants later this year. If anyone were to trawl through my social media they might discover the occasional criticism of government policy. And I might suffer the same fate as Dan Kaszeta.An expert on chemical weapons, Kaszeta had been invited to address a government-organised conference on the issue last week. Then, he was disinvited because, as an official email put it, a “check on your social media has identified materials that criticised government officials and policy”.Under secret rules drawn up by Rees-Mogg, civil servants must trawl through social media posts of all speakers at official events. Anyone critical of government policy can be banned. Not just Kaszeta, but a number of other speakers, too, have been disinvited for “criticism of government policy”.This is a government that preens its advocacy of free speech. Its Higher Education (Freedom of Speech) Act 2023, which became law this month, allows speakers to seek compensation if they are “no-platformed” and empowers the Office for Students (OfS) to fine infringing institutions. But what the law proclaims universities mustn’t do, the government itself is happy to.The greatest chill on free speech in universities today comes not from students no-platforming speakers but from Prevent, the government anti-terror policy that has helped create a climate of self-censorship, placing certain topics, ideas and arguments off-limits. In 2019, the court of appeal ruled that Prevent guidance to universities was unlawful because it was so “unbalanced” against free speech.Earlier this year, in a parliamentary debate, the home secretary, Suella Braverman, called for opponents of Prevent to be denied a “platform” to “ensure that… misrepresentations of Prevent are deterred”. A government whose own legislation demands that universities be sanctioned if they ban speakers with controversial views wants also to no-platform critics of its own policies.It’s not just the government with a one-eyed view of free expression. Recent years have seen the emergence of organisations, such as Toby Young’s brainchild, the Free Speech Union (FSU), whose defence of free speech seems driven primarily by a hostility to “woke” policies. Last week, the FSU tweeted about Matthew Goodwin’s new book on the “woke elite” (it is hosting a panel discussion on it), and about Amazon’s “sanitising” of David Cronenberg’s 1988 cult classic film Dead Ringers in its remake. It was, however, silent on the Kaszeta ban.The FSU’s 2020 report Threats to Academic Freedom in Britain mentions the impact of Prevent policies just once, and then only to castigate “leftists” for being more concerned about “threats from outside the university” than about the woke culture of censorship internally. And where the FSU has welcomed the new universities free speech law and dismissed criticisms, longstanding anti-censorship organisations, such as Index on Censorship and English PEN, have rightly warned of the dangers of state-imposed free expression.Yet, if there is a selectiveness in the way anti-woke free speech champions look upon censorship, many of the issues they highlight are nevertheless important. There is growing support in sections of the left and on campuses for the suppression of unacceptable views.The Higher Education Policy Institute found in a student survey last year that 79% thought “Students that feel threatened should always have their demands for safety respected” and more than a third believed academics should be sacked for teaching “material that heavily offends some students”. “Many people may be surprised, perhaps even unsettled”, the report observed, “by the greater keenness of students to limit what their peers and lecturers can say and do within the law”.Last week, the OfS, as part of its regular reporting on the impact of Prevent guidance, published data on cancellations of university talks. Out of 31,545 speakers in the academic year 2021-22, 260 had their events cancelled. The reasons for doing so are unclear; the OfS data unfortunately does not show how many speakers were banned because their views were deemed unacceptable. Whatever the figure, it is small – less than 1%. This shouldn’t lead us to conclude, though, that there is no issue. Controversial speakers will inevitably be small in number, but attempts to stop them speaking often highlight a deeper problem, particularly the tendency to portray political and social disagreements as “hatred” or “bigotry”.The most incendiary issue at the moment is that of trans rights. “Gender critical” feminists such as Kathleen Stock or Julie Bindel, who argue for the importance of sex-based rights and for the exclusion of transgender women from sex-based, women-only spaces, such as refuges or prisons, have faced calls for their meetings to be shut down.There is an important debate about how to negotiate trans and women’s rights. Shutting down one side is unacceptableMany of their critics argue that such individuals are not being censored because they have other platforms on which they are able to express their views, from newspaper columns to books. That is to miss the point. After all, Kaszeta can also avail himself of other platforms. That does not mean that what happened to him is not censorship.At the same time, opponents of gender critical views should be equally free to express themselves. Last week, a tweet from Oxford University LGBTQ+ campaign calling for Stock’s invitation to speak at the Oxford Union to be rescinded was taken down by the student union on the grounds it might infringe the new law. The FSU crowed about it as a victory. It was, in fact, a blatant denial of free speech. The episode revealed both how state-imposed free speech can itself be a form of censorship and how little the FSU understands about the meaning of free expression.There is an important debate about how to negotiate trans rights and women’s rights, and how best to ensure that both are respected. Shutting down one side of the debate as unacceptable will not settle the issues but merely make it more difficult to work out a fair solution.For too many people today, on both the left and the anti-woke right, what matters about free speech depends upon which side of the culture wars they stand. It is an issue too important to be treated with such casual disdain. Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist

Rapid increases since the national living wage’s 2016 introduction have slashed the proportion of “low paid” employees (earning below two-thirds of the typical hourly wage) to 9% (versus 21% in 2015), the lowest in more than 50 years.This is what real progress looks like, but it is not mission accomplished, because lower earners may have higher wages but still too often lack something else: good work.We’ve chosen as a country to give low earners little or no protection from unexpected changes to the hours or shifts they work. The result? Four times as many of them experience volatile hours (and therefore pay) as higher earners. Try paying the rent with that insecurity.And when life gets difficult, lower earners’ incomes take a hit in a way higher earners almost never experience. The majority of those earning less than £20,000 a year tell us that if they have to miss work for a family emergency, such as a sick child, they won’t be paid.And if they get sick themselves it’s terrible for their financial, not just physical, health. If I can’t work I get paid in full, but we’ve chosen to leave lower earners with disgracefully low sick pay: if you’re sick for one week you are left with £43.76 to live on because you’re not paid for the first three days.Even as the minimum wage has risen, lower earners’ work has become more intense and their job satisfaction has fallen. Good work is the mission but, with next to no progress beyond raising the minimum wage, it’s very much not one we’ve accomplished. Torsten Bell is chief executive of the Resolution Foundation.

For the second time in two months a space ship took off, its fiery trail vanishing wisp-like into the blue autumn sky.”Thus Angus MacVicar began his novel Return to the Lost Planet, with words that have stayed with me since its publication in 1954 and its later serialisation by the BBC. Scotland was here depicted as an international centre of rocketry, with its glens and hills regularly reverberating to the sound of missions blasting their way to other worlds, in this case “the lost planet” of Hesikos.This fictional vision of my home country – as a space power – has never left me and, I am happy to report, after many decades, my hopes for Scottish rocketry may, at last, become reality. According to current schedules, Scotland will indeed ring to the sound of rockets regularly demolishing its moorland peace as probes are blasted into orbit round the Earth. Indeed, two rival centres, one in Sutherland, the other in Shetland, are already vying to become the first spaceport in Britain – indeed in Europe – next year. Other sites – in the Western Isles; at Machrihanish, near Campbeltown, in Argyll; and at Prestwick, near Glasgow – are also being considered as launch centres.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterArchie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morningPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Cornwall and Wales have also outlined plans for their own spaceports. The crucial point is that Britain seems on course to achieve its goal of becoming a satellite launch power in its own right, after decades of relying on US or Russian rockets to put our probes into orbit. Such confidence is worth noting after a week in which a major player in this fledgling industry – Richard Branson’s Virgin Orbit – announced that it was shutting down operations, triggering headlines about the threat to UK space ambitions.Virgin Orbit used a jumbo jet, christened Cosmic Girl, to carry a rocket, strapped to a wing, to high altitude where it was released and ignited, carrying its satellite cargo into orbit. Several payloads were launched from California this way but an attempt to repeat these successes in Cornwall earlier this year ended in failure. Last month, Branson chose to auction off Virgin Orbit’s main assets, recovering just over $36m (£29m), a mere 1% of the company’s Wall Street value of $3.5bn in 2021.The demise of Virgin Orbit was regrettable but it was not a major setback, insiders insist. They say that the changes that have been transforming the launch business have a momentum that is too great to derail Britain’s space ambitions – which are primarily focused on developing vertical take-off rockets to launch satellites for telecommunications and for monitoring Earth’s environment.The first satellites used to monitor the Earth were the size of cars. Today you could fit them into a small shoeboxMatt Archer“The first satellites that were used to monitor the Earth were the size of cars. Today you could fit them into a small shoebox,” says Matt Archer, launch director of the UK Space Agency, which provides seed funding for many spaceport projects. “That is a game changer.”Such dramatic miniaturisation means that three-stage behemoths – like the 54-metre-high Ariane 5 rocket – are unnecessary for launching the kind of satellites that the UK wants to put in orbit. The Orbex Prime rockets that will take off from Space Hub Sutherland – located on the A’Mhoine peninsula northwest of Tongue village – will be 19 metres high and consist of only two stages. ABL rockets that will lift off from SaxaVord on the island of Unst, in Shetland, will be only slightly bigger.These two sites come with benefits. Earth-monitoring spacecraft that study sea-level fluctuations and ice-sheet changes often fly in orbits that sweep them over the poles, allowing them to monitor the entire planet underneath. So, blasting a rocket northwards, over open seas instead of over inhabited land, gives a key advantage to spaceports such as Sutherland and to SaxaVord, which is located on the most northerly inhabited island in the UK.Archer predicts that there will be around a dozen launches from these spaceports by the end of the decade. These are not going to make them the Cape Canaverals of the north. But they will still have an important impact. The oil industry is leaving Scotland, young people are departing from rural areas, and the population there is ageing. A vibrant space industry will provide jobs for skilled, educated young people. The Scottish government estimates that its space sector could generate £4bn for the economy by 2030, as well as creating 20,000 jobs.It is a promising prospect, though caution is required. No rocket has yet taken off from British soil and put a satellite into orbit. The technology is risky. Just ask Branson. Delays are likely and next year’s schedule for the first launches from Sutherland and Shetland could easily slip. Nevertheless, I remain hopeful about the realisation of my childhood dream. One day soon spaceships will indeed fracture the tranquillity of the Highlands as they head to the heavens.TopicsAerospace industryOpinionScotlandWalesCornwallSpaceSatellitesVirgin GroupcommentReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedUKUK politicsEducationMediaSocietyLawScotlandWalesNorthern IrelandNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

It is set in 2032, and Anna, a former influencer, is due to undergo an extreme surgery, Aesthetica (also the title of the book, by Allie Rowbottom), which promises to reverse every cosmetic procedure she’s had on her face and body over the past 15 years. “This is the best I can hope for,” Anna thinks. “A clean slate before the next storm, next tragedy, next decade.” As soon as I’d finished reading the book, I started to read about the book. At the author’s book launch, Botox was available alongside the drinks, a sly little nod to the slipperiness of the subject, and the strange dissonance between who we are and how we look.That reversal surgery seemed both the grim stuff of a body-horror film and also, completely reasonable. When Kylie Jenner appeared to have dissolved her famous lip fillers, clinics reported an immediate rise in requests for similar procedures. And more celebrities started doing the same: the Evening Standard reported how Kate Moss’s half-sister Lottie had paid £450 to get lip fillers then the same price to get them dissolved. American model Blac Chyna posted a video of her facial fillers getting dissolved. “Back to the baseline…” she said. Courteney Cox talked on a podcast about her biggest beauty regrets: “Fillers,” but, “I was able to reverse most of that.” We are seeing a shift in beauty, a living make-under montage. Almost a decade since Jenner first admitted to lip fillers (increasing Google searches for them by 11,300% in 24 hours), injectables have spread through towns and faces with remarkable speed, sometimes “migrating” from eye to cheek, leaving people looking vaguely uncanny, or from famous pop stars to tired mums on a Black Friday deal. But now, patients are reporting “filler fatigue” and sharing their own journeys back to that mythical “clean slate”.I was surprised, briefly, at my reaction to this trend. A good thing, no? No, Eva? A good thing, surely, if women are feeling more comfortable in their own skins, less quick to rush to a needle, less appalled by their ageing faces, in slower pursuit of perfection? I mean, yes. If that was what we were really seeing. The truth, as always, is so much less simple: truths about beauty and body image are always complicated by politics and a certain kind of scar tissue. Of course a time would come when fillers would go out of fashion; this is how fashions work. The same has happened with every other cosmetic surgery, from breast implants to, more recently, bum implants. Once a trend becomes accessible to everybody, those with more capital will reject it and move on to the next, less accessible thing. That’s what wealth brings – the power to change, at the flick of a needle. And while we continue to uphold the same bitter beauty standards – grounded in wealth, youth and whiteness – the most privileged people will continue to buy their way in and uphold that power.Whenever the word ‘natural’ appears it plucks at our morals, it alludes to shameThere is an irony, with the celebrity shift away from injectable fillers towards some sense of “natural” beauty, in the fact that the former was a face that was achievable to anyone willing to take the risks and pay the cash. But the latter, a face with perfect skin, a small nose and high cheekbones, is a far more expensive illusion. Whenever the word “natural” appears it plucks at our morals, it alludes to shame, it looks back over its shoulder at those left behind, with sneering pity.Cosmetic procedures are in constant conversation with social media, and the impossible beauty standards enabled by airbrushing and Instagram filters. Last week, when Martha Stewart became the oldest Sports Illustrated cover model ever, at 81, the reaction was shock and applause. And yes, fabulous, but: what were we applauding? Her lack of wrinkles? A body that looks half its age? And if that, then, why? The body of a sometime billionaire has very little in common with the body of a normal person, beyond its abilities to eat, shit and breathe. It occurred to me that only other 81-year-olds will have anything to compare those photos to; the rest of us are unlikely to have seen many, if any, 81-year-old swimsuited, unmodified bodies. As a portrait of Martha Stewart, the shoot is fine, but any attempt to expand its meaning beyond that stalls quite quickly. My point is, for all the reports of change, for all the noisy moves towards diversity and authenticity, I’m deeply suspicious about any progress having been made at all.Beauty trends cycle and spin in ever-decreasing circles; the fashionable face was inflated, so inevitably, it must now be deflated. The tits go up, the tits go down, the arse goes out, the arse goes in, a darkly merry dance – keep on improving, keep on buying, keep on judging, shaming, changing, keep on perfecting. And while it might take an hour in a clinic to dissolve a woman’s fillers, it’s a far larger job to dissolve the beauty standards that took her there in the first place.Email Eva at e.wiseman@observer.co.uk or follow her on Twitter @EvaWisemanTopicsBeautyThe Eva Wiseman columncommentReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedFashionFoodRecipesTravelHealth & fitnessWomenMenLove & sexBeautyHome & gardenMoneyCarsNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Lestienne rashes in, flips a lovely pick-up pass, raises set point, and a Khachanov double means he leads the number 11 seed 6-3 6-1! He’s noises up the crowd as you might, and the crowd is swelling nicely, excited to see what could well be the story of the day.29m ago06.33 EDTIt’s worth noting that it’s nice and warm in Paris, and when that’s the case it’s a different tournament to when it’s cold.

Her tough luck to get this draw, and Saba tells Fabrice she’s delighted and appreciates the crowd’s support – she had initially thought it was her they were jeering. She says the win in Australia was huge for her, but she thought her first major would be Roland Garros – she’s not sure why. It meant a lot that she beat Swiatek in the Madrid final, and gave her the confidence to think she can make something happen here.Updated at 06.43 EDT41m ago06.22 EDTAryna Sabalenka [2] beats Marta Kostyuk 6-3 6-2Another terrific performance from Saba, who meets Udvardy or Shymanovich next.

There’s was always been a touch of the Haleps about her – incredible power and hands, but not necessarily the temperament to back them up. Now, though, she’s a Grand Slam champ and no one can ever take that away from her; if it means she’s more relaxed at the business end, and it might, the rest of the field will do well to look out49m ago06.14 EDTOn Lenglen, Lestienne is whooping it up, a delectable lob earning him a break in set two … which he consolidates. He leads Khachanov 6-3-2-1, and is looking really good.

A first chance to see Tsitsipas, of course, who is still gunning for a debut major. Can he make it here? Will he ever make it?

The defending champ has won here in two of the last three years and also holds the US Open title, which is to say we might be starting an epoch. She looks by far the best player on tour and at 21 still has lots of improving to do … except women’s tennis is least predictable sport on the planet, so really, who knows? Yes, she’s a strong favourite, but also, we need to see more before we can assume what she’ll do with that; she gets going tomorrow and in the meantime, Aryna Sabalenka, seeded two and a new person having finally won her first major in Melbourne, has a chance to show us how she’s feeling.The men’s side, meanwhile, has no Rafael Nadal – champion in 14 of the last 18 years. What a ludicrous sentence that is! But he’s not here this term, meaning an opportunity for everyone else – in particular, Novak Djokovic, as if he needs such a a thing, and Carlos Alcaraz.Djokovic is tied with Nadal on 22 Grand Slams, took the Australian Open in January, and looks for all the world like he can keep winning them until the end of time; arguably, no sportsperson has ever been harder to beat. Alcaraz, though, is on the surge, a brilliant clay-courter with a majestic all-court game; at some point, this competition will surely belong to him, and that point might just be now. This is going to be great.TopicsFrench Open 2023French OpenTennisReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedSoccerNFLTennisMLBMLSNBANHLF1GolfNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

A more activist fanbase would have turned Filbert Way into the toxic cauldron the club deserves. 0/10Premier League 2022-23 fans’ verdicts, part one: Arsenal to LeedsRead moreStars/flops At a push, Nampalys Mendy turned out to be less crap than the rest of them. Flops? Literally everyone else.Biggest surprise I genuinely thought we’d be comfortable in mid-table this season. What shocked me most about the club is just how deep the rot of complacency had set in. From the players to managers to the board and even the media covering the club, all of them hold a significant share of culpability for this calamity.Best and worst away fans I couldn’t tell you who the best were – I was too busy staring off into the distance contemplating the abyss on the many occasions we’ve been turned over at home. The worst were Nottingham Forest, because we don’t like them.Moment that made me smile The arrival of the new Big Strong Leicester Boys podcast, fronted by Jake Watson, was a rare positive - some real catharsis there. A sorely needed refuge for fans. Chris Whiting clippings.me/chriswhiting; @ChrisRWhitingLeicester: hubris, dither and delusion? Photograph: Katie Chan/Action Plus/ShutterstockLiverpoolUntil our run of eight wins in nine we’d been pretty inconsistent – 9-0 against Bournemouth and 7-0 against United tempered by below-par performances, defeats and listless draws. But the past couple of months have seen us get back to what we’ve come to expect and for every low, we’ve had multiple highs. The boss has had a rocky time of it too, obviously, but anyone doubting him needs a rethink. We didn’t challenge for the title, as we thought we would, but that’s football. That’s life, as Jürgen would say. 7/10Stars/flops Alisson has been immense. Without him we’d have finished in a lower position for sure. Mo Salah. Again. He’s scored over 20 goals and made numerous assists. Bobby Firmino was at his superlative best at the start of the season, until injury, and Stefan Bajcetic at just 18 was a star in midfield – looking forward to his return next season. A sometimes collective loss of form from some players, including our big names, added to a strange season. See below.Biggest surprise The way we struggled at times, particularly away. Reams have been written as to why: loss of form, lack of investment, injuries, burnout from last season … We’ve probably witnessed the end of an era and are now looking to rebuild. But it hasn’t all been bad, we’ve had some great performances and good times along the way.Best/worst away fans Forest were brilliant. A group of them paid their respects and laid flowers at both the Heysel and Hillsborough memorials and once in Anfield unfurled a huge banner that read: “Respect the 97. Solidarity with Survivors. No to Tragedy Chanting.” Arsenal, too, for their honouring of the minute’s silence for the 97. The worst, all those who continue with vile chants mocking the dead and those in poverty. Shame on you.Moment that made me smile Bobby scoring against Villa was ace. But the biggest win was publication of Uefa’s independent inquiry into the horrors in Paris at the Champions League final which, thanks to many, but particularly Spirit of Shankly, exonerated Liverpool supporters from all blame. Steph JonesStefan Bajcetic: teenage star in midfield. Photograph: Simon Stacpoole/Offside/Getty ImagesManchester CityIt’s been phenomenal. I don’t think any City fan thought in early February that we’d be on for the treble. It looked like a season of transition, even with Haaland. But this has been one of Pep’s greatest triumphs, second only to the 2020-21 season when he constructed a title-winning team without a striker – which was properly ridiculous. It’s all been about him; the money is obviously a huge factor, but I think rival fans are realising he is the difference. 9.5/10Stars/flops Haaland has obviously been the star, he’ll go from strength to strength. But I think most City fans would agree Rodri and Aké are comfortably second and third place for our POTY. De Bruyne, Grealish and Stones/Dias all deserve admirable mentions, but the unfancied duo are well-deserving of their top three slots.Biggest surprise The turnaround in form since that loss at Spurs in early February, and the Premier League charges that dropped the following day. We looked really disjointed at the time – Arsenal were imperious – and we’d just shipped a sulky Cancelo off to Bayern without a replacement. Most of our key players were struggling to recover their form and fitness after the World Cup. But Pep again proved himself an absolute genius of a coach and a brilliant man-motivator, too. His press conference immediately after the charges genuinely made my hair stand on end, seeing the pride with which he talked about the club. His club.Best/worst away fans Leeds were best. I wanted them to stay up … before Big Sam. Worst? Surprisingly, Liverpool.Moment that made me smile Away from City, watching Brighton has been an absolute joy. They play such daring and exciting football under De Zerbi and have a wealth of good young players. From a selfish point of view, I hope we can sign a couple in the summer. Lloyd Scragg 9320pod.com; @lloyd_scraggPep Guardiola: making the difference. Photograph: Michael Regan/Getty ImagesManchester UnitedIt’s been mixed: we played some good football but also fell apart spectacularly at times, taking some heavy losses on the road. But losing Casemiro, Varane, Rashford, Eriksen, Martínez and Garnacho at critical times was unlucky. Ten Hag impressed, dealing swiftly with the Ronaldo sideshow, dropping the captain and improving the likes of Rashford, Shaw and Wan Bissaka. He now knows who he can rely on, and I expect the likes of Maguire, Martial, De Gea and possibly Sancho to follow Phil Jones out the door. He’s going to need several transfer windows to turn us into title challengers, but it’s been a good start. 7/10Stars/flops Martínez defended like his life was on the line and his tacking and passing out from the back has been incredible. He has this natural ability to sniff out danger: our best signing for years. Rashford is fulfilling the potential we all knew he had and the emergence of Garnacho has been wonderful: a real match-winner for the future. Sancho, though, hasn’t matched his big reputation or price: a winger who won’t take players on. I just can’t see how he succeeds in this team.Biggest surprise It’s been a long old road but after 18 years we’re finally getting rid of our parasitic owners.Best/worst away fans West Ham brought big numbers for a televised midweek game in the FA Cup and were noisy throughout. Worst were Liverpool: not a peep out of them until they scored in the 81st minute.Moment that made me smile Ten Hag’s dad-dancing at Wembley. Shaun O’Donnell""You should resign after that."" 🤣 Roy Keane shares his thoughts on Erik ten Hag's dancing 🕺 pic.twitter.com/gCJKlReB1A— Football Daily (@footballdaily) February 26, 2023NewcastleFans hoped we’d build on last season’s extraordinary turnaround, but not many expected what we got: a first cup final since 1999 and a season in the top four. The football is some of the best since the Keegan or Robson eras, and Eddie Howe deserves the plaudits. He’s brought world-beating performances out of pre-takeover signings such as Schär, Joelinton and Willock, and created a fearsome team spirit. 9/10Stars/flops There were stars all over, from graceful striker Alexander Isak, midfield fulcrum Bruno Guimarães and ever-smiling sprinter Miguel Almirón to powerhouse Sven Botman, cult hero Dan Burn and our indefatigable leader, Kieran Trippier. Flops? Ryan Fraser ended up training with the under-21s and faces an uncertain future. For a player of his talent, that’s a waste.Biggest surprise The reinvention of Sean Longstaff. The local lad’s form dipped alarmingly under Steve Bruce and some fans got on his back. But under Howe he has established himself as integral to the high-press tactic. He deserves a nice lie down on a beach after the graft he’s put in.Best/worst away fans The best were the Spurs fans who endured their 6-1 drubbing and stayed to the end. The worst were the Spurs fans who abandoned their team 21 minutes in. Though you have to have some sympathy…Moment that made us smile The great reception given to our women’s side at half-time at our game against Brighton after their National League Division One North title win. It’s great to see such progress throughout the club. David and Richard HolmesSean Longstaff: local lad reinvented. Photograph: Serena Taylor/Newcastle United/Getty ImagesNottingham ForestIt’s worked out OK in the end, hasn’t it? At the start and mid-points I said 17th would be a victory, anything else would be a bonus, so I’m delighted. Stevie Cooper is either the greatest conman of all time or he’s genuinely a brilliant coach and wonderful human being. The owner rightly realised Cooper’s the glue that bound the club and fans together for the last 18 months and stuck by him. It was all a bit hairy for a while, but it’s a 7/10 for me.Stars/flops Morgan Gibbs-White looks a steal at £30m. Apparently survival stuck an extra £5m on the price, but we won’t pay the quoted £42.5m unless we qualify for the Champions League. Are Wolves fans still laughing now? But the beating heart of our team is Ryan Yates: homegrown and a Forest fan. We look so much more competitive when he is fit. Jesse Lingard didn’t work out, though – at least on the pitch. His personality and demeanour make him popular, but he never looked fully fit and made only a fleeting contribution.Biggest surprise We knew we needed 15 or so signings but got twice as many. Some actively made the squad worse. But even then we were carrying up to 12 injuries at a time for half the season, so the 25-man squad was stretched.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Football DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Credit also to Brighton for a good and loud following for a long midweek journey. Worst were Wolves: they can give it but they couldn’t take it when Gibbs-White beat them in the Carabao Cup shootout.Moment that made me smile Cooper screaming into the sky at the end of the game that secured our safety. Did I mention that I love him? Rich Ferraro 1865: The Nottingham Forest PodcastWe did it. pic.twitter.com/VLhpckYZLY— Nottingham Forest (@NFFC) May 20, 2023SouthamptonWhere to begin?! An absolute train wreck from start to finish. Many argued for the sacking of Ralph Hasenhüttl either during the summer or at various points until he was eventually shown the door in November. If those people had been told who his replacement would be they might have kept their counsel. The absolute bin fire that was Nathan Jones’s tenure came and went in a few months amid ludicrous press conferences and nonexistent tactics. Rubén Sellés then got two wins in his first three, but none since, so essentially all three have failed miserably. 0/10 is being generous.Stars/flops Not many stars, really. Roméo Lavia has been a standout for most of the season, Ward-Prowse hit yet more free-kick goals, and there’s been a surprise renaissance for Theo Walcott, but other than that, it’s thin gruel. Both keepers were terrible (one has the excuse of being 21, the other very much doesn’t). Meanwhile, we’ve been impotent up front, which naturally makes a winning combination.Biggest surprise Spending big without selling first to finance it. The only problem is it was mostly squandered, and we failed to get the centre-forward who might have seen us safe in what must be an all-time low-quality Premier League bottom half.Best/worst away fans Wolves fans seem to have a bit of beef with us for reasons best known to them, so their second-half turnaround at St Mary’s after spending an hour a man down was pretty loud (and put us out of our Jones misery). Most teams who have come to St Mary’s have left happy, although most of the games have blended into one by now so it’s difficult to pick out any particularly poor away crowds.Moment that made me smile Jones’s unhinged post-match press conference after defeat at Brentford. Fortunately he only lasted another week, but that was pretty funny in a “laugh at yourself so it doesn’t feel so painful” kind of way. Steve Grant SaintsWeb.co.uk; @SteveGrant1983Nathan Jones: nonexistent tactics. Photograph: Dan Mullan/Getty ImagesTottenhamThe season went exactly how it was always destined to go even if I spent the first half of it believing it would all work out in the end. Three managers, no identity, plenty of discontent. Conte the consultant imploded because he wasn’t really suited for us. A case of him making no concessions and Spurs appointing a coach for a quick fix without the necessary tools to achieve one. Again. 5/10, considering how hyped I was at the end of last season.Stars/flops Harry Kane. Obviously. Broke the Jimmy Greaves record: he’s our best forward, our best midfielder too. He’s rendered superlatives redundant. A modern-day tragedy that the past four years have been stagnant while Harry continues to define greatness. As for flops? I prefer “disappointments”. Factor in injuries, lack of rotation – Bissouma, Richarlison, Kulu, Bentancur too. We’ve had a rough time of it. Son’s form was, at times, tragic.Biggest surprise Even though you always expect things to go wrong, I didn’t quite see us collapsing to this current numb state of apathy. I predicted Champions League but instead we have a fragmented fanbase, no design or leadership from the board, possibly no European football, three “managers” in a season and the awkward persistence of playing two in the middle. Oh yeah, and no recognisable philosophy. COYS, Daniel.Best and worst away fans Champions League nights are usually great because the away fans seem more interested in singing and chanting than interacting organically with the game, so that was always a pleasant soundtrack to distract from the lack of rhythm on the pitch. Worst fans? Arsenal. Why? Why not? Anyone singing about north London when they originate from Plumstead playing under the guise of Woolwich gets my vote every time.Moment that made me smile I could write a book off the back of all the Spursy things that fizzled with bitter flavour across the season. However, Emerson Royal’s no-look pass résumé is unparalleled. I’ll add that I really like Emerson: him going from scapegoat to pretty decent right-back is heartwarming in a season of cold snaps. Spooky @Spooky23; patreon.com/SpookyInPurgatoryA tough crowd for Daniel Levy. Photograph: Richard Heathcote/Getty ImagesWest HamOur first European final since 1976. For success-starved fans it’s massive. At times Moyes’s counterattacking tactics looked outmoded and a £160m spend produced a relegation fight – though injuries to Aguerd, Scamacca, Paquetá and Zouma didn’t help. But Moyesy got results in the must-win games and credit to the board for sticking with him. Our near exemplary record in the Europa Conference has been underestimated; he deserves another crack at the job next season. Let’s see what he can do with Paquetá settled in and a fit Scamacca – though much will depend on how the money for Rice is spent. 7/10Stars/flops Declan Rice is our best player since Bobby Moore. Even though he’s probably off he’s given it everything and is still humble. It would be fantastic to see him join Moore and Bonds in lifting a trophy. Paquetá has provided memorable moments of showboating while Antonio has done well to see off the striking competition. Jarrod Bowen was more on fire after the World Cup break and Benrahma also had a mainly decent season. Flops include the hard-working but off-form Soucek, £35m Scamacca and Maxwel Cornet, who had a bad injury, but looked nothing like the player he was at Burnley.Biggest surprise Combining a relegation struggle with a European final. Pablo Fornals’s late winner against AZ Alkmaar will never be forgotten.Best/worst away fans Best were Leeds for noisily backing their losing side while dressed as nuns and Big Sam, which takes courage. Most overconfident were Arsenal for singing: “Are you in Tottenham in disguise?” and: “You’re going down,” only to see their 2-0 lead pegged back and their title bid derailed.Moment that made me smile Chelsea gave us fantastic comedy value by spending £600m but forgetting to sign a striker and then reappointing Everton reject Frank Lampard. Just hope they can stay up next season. Pete May Author, Goodbye to Boleyn; hammersintheheart.blogspot.co.ukDeclan Rice: still humble. Photograph: Simon Dael/ShutterstockWolvesUp to Christmas it would be 1/10 on the basis we were bottom but just about still breathing. Since Julen Lopetegui came in, though, it’s been closer to an 8. We escaped relegation with three games to spare and enjoyed a couple of fine victories. He’s been excellent and must be retained at all costs. So overall, for the season, 6/10.Premier League 2022-23 fans’ verdicts, part one: Arsenal to LeedsRead moreStars/flops Rúben Neves kept us afloat in those horrible early months and made key contributions throughout. Craig Dawson and Mario Lemina were vital January additions. Matheus Nunes has to be a flop given what we paid for him and the expectations about what he’d bring, but he did produce a couple of big moments to help keep us up, including the goal of the season against Chelsea.Biggest surprise The January splurging. The owners have been notoriously stingy mid-season and always retained a very lean squad. This time they recognised the desperate need for reinforcements and that business was the difference. All six players contributed in some way.Best/worst away fans Leeds are the best and worst. Really loud and annoying. And yes, I am being salty because they’ve inflicted a couple of painful defeats in recent years.Moment that made me smile The reaction to Big Sam’s arrival at Leeds with four games to go. Especially one fan commenting: “Give him the next two but make sure there’s a replacement lined up for the run-in.” Thomas Baugh wolvesblog.com; @wolvesblogRúben Neves: kept Wolves afloat.

The success was followed by the almost immediate announcement that Oliver Kahn, the club’s CEO, who was not in Cologne, and Hasan Salihamidzic, their sporting director, would leave the club.Dortmund had gone into the last game of the season in top spot but stumbled to a 2-2 draw against Mainz, allowing Bayern to squeeze past them in the tightest league race in years.Borussia Dortmund hand Bundesliga title to Bayern Munich with Mainz drawRead moreIn a climactic season finale, Bayern were celebrating what ended up being an unexpected title win while Dortmund’s dreams of their first league trophy since 2012 were left in tatters as they found themselves trailing Mainz 2-0 early on before battling back – but they needed victory to become champions. Bayern finished on 71 points, ahead on goal difference. Leipzig and Union Berlin finished third and fourth respectively and will also compete in the Champions League next season. Hertha Berlin and Schalke were relegated, while Stuttgart will go into the relegation playoff.“It is unbelievable that I experience such a title race,” said Thomas Müller, who celebrated a record 12th Bundesliga title. “We conceded an equaliser just as we have done the entire season and then Musiala drills in the winner. That makes you crazy.“People interested in football have the feeling that we do not deserve this and I clearly say I understand that because of the second half of the season being so chaotic for us. But it is still an unbelievable moment. Crazy, electric. I hoped it would happen but did not think it would.”While the title win rescues some silverware in what has been a frustrating season for Bayern, news emerged shortly after the final whistle that Jan-Christian Dreesen, the current CFO and vice-chairman, is set to become the new CEO. The search for Salihamidzic’s replacement has begun. “This was decided by the club’s supervisory board,” read a club statement.Jamal Musiala celebrates the decisive goal against Cologne. Photograph: Thilo Schmülgen/ReutersThomas Tuchel, the club’s manager, said in a post-match interview with Sky Germany of the backroom changes: “I have been informed yesterday. They convinced me to join Bayern. We have won the title. Now we have the next political topic.”A tweet from Kahn’s account read: “I would like to celebrate with you, but unfortunately I can’t be with you today because I was forbidden.”Unglaublich! Ein ganz großes Kompliment und Gratulation Jungs! Ich hab's euch immer gesagt! Immer bis zum Schluss alles geben und niemals aufgeben. Ich bin unheimlich stolz auf euch und diese Leistung! Ich würde gerne mit euch mitfeiern, aber leider kann ich heute nicht bei euch…— Oliver Kahn (@OliverKahn) May 27, 2023The surprise sacking of Julian Nagelsmann in late March and the arrival of Tuchel did not bring success, with the team crashing out of the German Cup and the Champions League last eight.The Bavarians needed a win against Cologne and Kingsley Coman settled their nerves early on, putting them into the lead with a superbly curled shot into the top corner. With Dortmund behind in the first half, Bayern knew they were now in front and controlled the first half without risking too much. Leroy Sané did slot in just before the break but his effort did not count following a VAR review for handball.With Bayern club bosses, including Salihamidzic, nervously checking their phones for the score in Dortmund, Cologne earned an 80th-minute penalty and Dejan Ljubicic sent the keeper the wrong way to level.Sané thought he had missed the chance to hand his team the title when he failed to beat the Cologne keeper in the 88th minute, but Musiala did it perfectly a minute later, curling in a low drive to end a rollercoaster season.TopicsBayern MunichThe ObserverBundesligaEuropean club footballnewsReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedSoccerLive scoresTablesFixturesResultsCompetitionsClubsNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

He knew it was good. Referees reviewed it, but it didn’t take long to give the official word.Elation for Boston. Devastation for Miami.“Just happy we won,” White said. “Whatever it takes.”Jayson Tatum scored 31 points, Jaylen Brown scored 26 and Marcus Smart added 21 for the Celtics, who became only the fourth NBA team to erase a 3-0 deficit in a best-of-seven series and force a deciding game. The others in that club – the 1951 New York Knicks in the NBA finals, the 1994 Denver Nuggets in the second round and the 2003 Portland Trail Blazers in the first round – all lost Game 7, all on the road.Boston, however, are going home for their shot at history. Game 7 is Monday night on the Celtics’ floor, a matchup that’ll decide who meets the Western Conference champion Denver Nuggets in a title series that will start Thursday.“It’s a seven-game series,” Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. “There’s nothing better than Game 7s.”Derrick White of the Celtics scores the game-winning putback in Saturday’s Game 6 of the Eastern Conference finals. Photograph: Issac Baldizon/NBAE/Getty ImagesJimmy Butler made three free throws with 3.0 seconds left for a one-point Heat lead, capping a Miami rally from 10 points down with less than four minutes remaining.The Celtics had White inbound the ball on the game’s final possession, and he passed to Smart – who missed a three-pointer. But White sprinted from the inbound spot to the rim, the ball fell into his hands and he got the lay-in away just before time ran out.“Just resiliency from the guys,” Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla said. “That’s it.”Mazzulla was asked what went through his mind at that moment.“Nothing,” Mazzulla said. “Game 7.”Butler scored 24 points and Caleb Martin had 21 for the Heat, who are trying to pull off their own improbable trek to the title series by being only the second No 8 seed to make the NBA finals. They’ve now lost as many games this week – three – as they had in their first 14 playoff games this spring combined on the way to ousting No 1 Milwaukee, then No 5 New York and taking what was supposed to be an insurmountable 3-0 lead over the second-seeded Celtics.The Celtics have now won five of their last six East finals games in Miami – a stretch that includes a Game 7 over the Heat last season to reach the NBA finals.That one, obviously, ended the Heat season. At least this time, Miami still has a chance.“I don’t know how we’re going to get this done, but we’re going to go out there and get it done,” Spoelstra said. “And that’s what the next 48 hours is about. There’s been nothing easy about this season for our group, and so we just have to do it the hard way.”The Heat are the 151st team to grab a 3-0 series lead in a best-of-seven. All 150 of the previous clubs finished the job. But the Celtics have made very clear that they have other ideas, and Mazzulla listed a lot of reasons why.“Faith. Love. Togetherness. Physicality. Belief. Hope.” Mazzulla said. “All those things combined. It starts with the locker room. Those guys had a choice to make and they chose to believe in each other.”TopicsNBABoston CelticsMiami HeatBasketballUS sportsReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedSoccerNFLTennisMLBMLSNBANHLF1GolfNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Multiple important saves across the season and the shootout star of the dramatic WCL win over Lyon alongside Maren Mjelde. What she has gone through off the pitch, recovering from a recurrence of thyroid cancer, makes her performances all the more impressive. 8Zecira Musovic Has had to settle in the role as Chelsea’s No 2 once again with only seven league starts this campaign. Reliable back-up when called upon. 7The story of Chelsea’s remarkable fourth consecutive WSL title triumph | Suzanne WrackRead moreDefendersMagdalena Eriksson A stalwart in defence over her six years at the club, she struggled early on with rumours swirling around her potential departure. Since January, though, she has returned to form, creating a perhaps unpredictably strong partnership with Mjelde over the last few months. She will head for pastures new but scoring on her home send-off seemed written in the stars. 8Kadeisha Buchanan Her high-profile arrival from Lyon promised much but her first season has had its challenges. Her competitive debut was shaky, conceding a penalty against Liverpool, and her struggles have continued. Progress not helped by an injury picked up against Lyon that kept her out of action in the run in. 7Niamh Charles Missing out on the Euros would shake most players but she returned this season more determined than ever. Her versatility is key – played either side as full-back, wing-back and in attack. Reliable, strong in transition, and with an eye for goal. Strong performances have translated to the WCL, where she is regularly called on. 8Millie Bright Injury unfortunately curtailed her season but before that she was the glue that held Chelsea’s defence together. One of Emma Hayes’s leaders in the dressing room, she is a commanding presence, no-nonsense in a challenge and possesses the ability to turn defence into attack with remarkable accuracy. 9Ève Périsset Arriving in the summer, the transition to WSL football has not always looked easy. Thirteen leagues starts, sharing minutes with Charles in the right-back role, she has looked more settled since January and her physicality is improving. Plenty of promise for the years ahead. 7Jess Carter Took time to get going this season. Not a regular starter in the league but her development has been noteworthy. Played as a left-back and central defender and looks particularly comfortable when put in a back three. Caught the eye against Barcelona and Lyon. 8Maren Mjelde Has largely had to watch from the side-lines this season but brilliant when called upon. Centre-back partnership with Eriksson has thrived of late. Her composure from the spot, twice, sent Chelsea through to the WCL semi-finals. 7Aniek Nouwen Signed a new contract in January but spent the second half of the season out on loan at Milan after only one league start. 5Alsu Abdullina Made just six appearances off the bench. Rumoured loan moves never transpired. 5Millie Bright as excelled at the back for Chelsea. Photograph: Eddie Keogh/The FA/Getty ImagesMidfieldersGuro Reiten Without doubt, Chelsea’s player of the season. At times understated, the Norwegian has gone from strength to strength, developing into one of the most potent and intelligent wide players in the league. Ever present, the accuracy of her delivery sees her lead the WSL in assists (11) and she has chipped in with an impressive nine goals. 10Erin Cuthbert Her move from wing-back to central midfield has been seamless. Integral to Chelsea’s success, she’s the engine that makes everything tick. Unceasingly competitive and consistent, her drive to improve is evident. Scored her 50th goal for the club against Leicester this month. 10skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Moving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterInformative, passionate, entertaining.

Signed a new contract with the club in December. Has had slightly less game time this year but performance level has remained high. She provides strong protection while also chipping in with goals and assists. 8Melanie Leupolz Returned from maternity leave in January to put pen-to-paper on a new deal. Has found her feet once again, rebuilding relationships with her fellow midfielders and improving game by game. A broken nose against Lyon did not hamper her progress. 7Jessie Fleming Has perhaps caught the eye less than last season after a slow start but her influence has still been felt, especially in recent months. Her versatility is a key weapon for Hayes who has praised the work she has done to match the league’s physicality. A new contract in November shows her value. 7Jelena Cankovic Made a strong impression when called upon in her first season in a Chelsea shirt. Hit the ground running in December, scoring her first two goals against Reading. 7Katerina Svitkova Arrived from West Ham in the summer to bolster the midfield. Surgery on a knee injury kept her out for much of the season. 5Erin Cuthbert (centre) lets fly against Reading on Saturday.  Photograph: Tom Phillips/SPP/ShutterstockForwardsSam Kerr By her high standards, this season probably will not register as her best. Remains a big-time player made for the most important moments. In the absence of Kirby and Harder, and the transfer of England, she has shouldered the attacking responsibility with 12 league goals, 5five assists, and a never-ending abundance of energy. 9Lauren James One of the most technically gifted players in the game. Fully fit at the start of the season, she hit the ground running with eye-catching performances. Possesses a unique ability to make the sport look easy and has built a strong partnership with Kerr, chipping in with five league goals. Performances tailed off slightly but at just 21, she’s Chelsea’s star for the future. 9Emergency surgery to Chelsea glory: Emma Hayes’ extraordinary seasonRead moreJohanna Rytting Kaneryd Joining in the summer from Häcken, the 26-year-old Swede has had to settle for a role on the bench. With just seven league starts, she has struggled to make her mark on the right with James in front of her. 6Pernille Harder Despite missing much of the season with a nasty hamstring injury, her status as one of the world’s best players is clear to see. Has thrilled Chelsea fans since her return, with five goals in the last five league games. The key behind Chelsea’s FA Cup victory. Will be missed at the club next season. 8Fran Kirby Another disrupted season. Strong start but illness and a knee injury suffered against West Ham in February has kept her out for large spells. 6Bethany England Spent first half of the campaign on the bench as back up to Kerr. Two league goals in eight appearances. Made high-profile move to Tottenham in January in search of game time. 6TopicsChelsea WomenWomen's Super LeagueWomen's footballfeaturesReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedSoccerLive scoresTablesFixturesResultsCompetitionsClubsNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Part two: Leicester to Wolves
Observer fans' networkSun 28 May 2023 03.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 28 May 2023 03.11 EDTArsenalThe best campaign in a couple of decades of underachievement. Few were tipping us for the top four, so there’s no shame in being the only club to challenge City’s dominance – particularly impressive given the continued absence of a deterrent against financial doping. There’s no escaping the sense, though, that we might be waiting a long time for a better title-winning opportunity, given our lack of cup and European distractions at the business end. The test now for Mikel Arteta is whether he can improve the squad depth enough for us to arrive in the finishing straight looking less burned out next season. 9/10Premier League 2022-23 fans’ verdicts, part two: Leicester to WolvesRead moreStars/flops Ramsdale, Ødegaard, Saka, Martinelli, Saliba and Zinchenko starred, but really it was a team effort. The only letdown was Vieira’s failure to grasp his opportunities. Fábio’s body language doesn’t exactly scream hunger and desire, but I’m not about to write him off just yet.Biggest surprise I’ve been saying for years that we wouldn’t achieve top four so long as Xhaka remained at our fulcrum. But with Partey protecting the defence Granit moved into a more advanced role and became everybody’s darling. He saved his best season to last.Best/worst away fans Best were Bodø/Glimt, despite their loss. Worst? Always Spurs. Most of them were out the door long before the final whistle.Moments that made me smile Tony Adams on Strictly; Emiliano Martínez’s Villa own goal; Conte’s meltdown press conference; and Newcastle 6-Spurs 1. Bernard Azulay onlinegooner.com; @GoonerN5Granit Xhaka: became everyone’s darling. Photograph: Lindsey Parnaby/AFP/Getty ImagesAston VillaSince November the season has been beyond any realistic dreams. The style and the effectiveness of our football have been a delight and the strategy and tactics from a different textbook entirely. “Unai Emery” could be my first tattoo at 51 (sorry, wife and kids). He’s brought a fractured club together, taught new tricks to senior dogs like Mings and McGinn, and been beautifully humble throughout. A demonstration that hard work and great coaching can achieve almost anything. I’m very confident we’ll squeak into Europe today but, either way, the 90 versus Newcastle and the two first halves against Spurs and Liverpool will never be forgotten. Just wow. 9/10Stars/flops Douglas Luiz rightly won player of the year despite starting only two of the first seven games. Tyrone Mings ran him very close having been dropped in August. If you want a flop, then it’s the former manager. The list of heroes is long. Ramsey, Martínez, Watkins, McGinn – I could go on naming players with 8+/10 seasons.Biggest surprise The change in mood. Emery mentions the “connection” with the supporters in every interview. Performances and this all-for-one spirit have aligned perfectly and the fusion is complete. Today’s Villa Park will be electric, and win or lose it will be a love-in – a mile away from the mostly bored, sometimes poisonous atmosphere last autumn.Best/worst away fans Everton best, Fulham worst. But really they’re all the same (and so are we) – sing when you’re winning, yawn when you’re not.Moment that made me smile All the players apparently shouting: “Don’t shoot,” at Bertrand Traoré in the 87th minute at Leicester, just before he smashed it into the top corner. Jonathan PritchardUnai Emery: beautifully humble throughout. Photograph: Molly Darlington/ReutersBournemouthWe survived. Job done. And barely anyone but us Cherries supporters thought we would. In a season where we were the first team to change our coach, were bought by a new owner, suffered a record-equalling 9-0 defeat and couldn’t get a point for an eternity after the World Cup, that’s an incredible success. Gary O’Neil and his team deserve high praise. We’re very conscious that he lacks experience, and in many games we’ve seen him learning painfully on the job – often, it’s not been pretty. But we got there in the end, and we’re looking forward to another top-flight season. 6/10Stars/flops Stars: Jefferson Lerma, Marcus Tavernier, Phil Billing, Neto and Dom Solanke. But everyone worked their socks off. Flops: Ryan Fredericks and Junior Stanislas were both too injury-prone and barely played.Biggest surprise The impact of new owner Bill Foley: ambitious, outgoing and positive. He’s building on the substantial legacy of Max Denim.Best/worst away fans Arsenal never stopped singing that Saliba song. The worst were Everton, abusing their own players and nearly starting a fight with some of them after the game.Moment that made me smile Our club social media team produced an end-of-season video compilation of all the pundits saying we would get relegated. What do so-called experts know, eh? Jeff Hayward Back of the Net podcast; @afcbpodcastCome on guys, you knew this was coming 😘 pic.twitter.com/k5L0TvqfD9— AFC Bournemouth 🍒 (@afcbournemouth) May 14, 2023BrentfordIt’s been magnificent. I predicted, maybe optimistically, that we’d finish a place higher than last season’s 13th. Never did I think we’d thrash United, comfortably beat Liverpool, Chelsea and Spurs, and be the only team to best City on their own patch. We’re still in with a shout of Europe with one game to go, so I can forgive our terrible cup runs. You know Thomas Frank is doing a grand job when the so-called big boys come sniffing. As the song goes, he knows exactly what we need. 9/10Stars/flops Ivan Toney has been the undoubted star, but Brian Mbeumo has come into his own since Toney’s absence. Ben Mee and Ethan Pinnock have been incredible at the back; Rico Henry is arguably the best left-back in the country but constantly gets overlooked for an England call-up. Flops? It’s hard to pick holes but, if I had to, Frank “the Tank” Onyeka hasn’t quite fulfilled his potential.Biggest surprise Beating Man City in their own backyard. We deserved it, too. I also didn’t foresee pundit Micah Richards finally backing down and admitting we were a decent team after coating us all last season. Fair play.Best/worst away fans Gillingham brought loads, sang loads and celebrated their League Cup shootout win like they’d won the final. The Priestfield was one of my first away games in the 80s. It’s hard to believe we were close rivals who used to play each other every season since then, until 10 years ago. Fulham were the worst, walking out on 85 minutes when we went 3-1 up, missing Vinícius making it 3-2. A real disrespect to their players. It wasn’t as if they had far to go home either. Weird.Moment that made me smile Bees fans chanting “Daniel Levy we want you to stay” during the 3-1 victory at Spurs. See also “Frank Lampard we want you to stay” at Stamford Bridge. Billy Grant Beesotted podcast and blog; @Beesotted; @BillyTheBee99Rico Henry: best left-back in the country? Photograph: Nigel Keene/ProSports/ShutterstockBrightonIncredible, we’re the luckiest fans in the world. Our best-ever finish, Europe for the first time, breathtaking football, a manager hailed by Guardiola as “one of the most influential in the last 20 years” and our owner, Tony Bloom, a lifelong fan who has given all the staff a 20% bonus. Brilliant, just brilliant. 10/10Stars/flops Roberto De Zerbi is a genius, he’s motivated the whole city – we’ve got loads more and better songs, and the Amex is rocking. It’s heartwarming to see so many youngsters thriving and stalwarts such as Lewis Dunk and Solly March playing out of their skins. Even when we sell players another star pops up. What a time to be alive. Nobody flopped: there probably isn’t one player who hasn’t enjoyed their best season – and it feels as if there is a lot more to come.Biggest surprise Potter going to Chelsea. Why leave such a well-run outfit for such a shambles? Also, the sheer resilience has been eye-opening: bouncing back from losing 5-1 at home to Everton by beating Arsenal 3-0 at the Emirates was quite something.Best and worst away fans The best were the City fans who clapped Julio Enciso’s wonder goal before it hit the net. The worst? Entertaining Palace gets more stressful and unpleasant every season, obnoxious lot.Moment that made me smile Putting six past Wolves on my 60th birthday. And the club’s De Zerbi cam on YouTube that follows him on the touchline: he’s all whistling, gestures and knee slides. Steph FinchamRoberto De Zerbi: motivated the whole city. Photograph: Jacques Feeney/Offside/Getty ImagesChelseaAn absolute shocker that nobody saw coming. League form was a shambles; it was only the performances in Europe that saved us from total disaster. Sacking Tuchel so early was ridiculous; Potter looked good to oversee a long-term project but couldn’t manage a large squad, find his best XI or find a way through so many injuries; and Lampard was clearly hired to appease fans and put players in the shop window: there’s no other explanation for some of his team selections. 4/10Stars/flops It’s hard to pick stand-out players, but Thiago Silva was great and Kepa made big saves. Cucurella was the chief flop, constantly out of position, a £62m headless chicken. Hopefully a new manager can sort him out.Biggest surprise The scale of the implosion, aided by a mad transfer policy and replacing the whole structure from the medical teams to the boardroom – it all felt like a strange business strategy from people who are supposed to be experts in their field. It tore the heart out of the club.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Football DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The worst were West Ham: a sea of flat caps and crossed arms. Not a good look.Moment that made me smile Amid the gloom, Spurs, as usual, didn’t let us down. Conte’s press conference where he ripped his squad apart telling the world what we all knew was pure box office. Once a blue, always a blue. Paul Baker in memory of Trizia FiorellinoMarc Cucurella: a £62m headless chicken? Photograph: Dave Shopland/ShutterstockCrystal PalaceIt’s a 7.5/10 season of two halves. All Palace fans wanted Patrick Vieira to succeed but there was just no way back for him from the dismal cup campaigns, the run of games without a win or a shot, the joylessness and the collapse in confidence of our flair players. Roy Hodgson’s impact has been immediate: wonderful, attacking football with a team full of freedom to play to their potential and score for fun.Stars/flops It’s just a matter of time before Marc Guéhi becomes a mainstay of England’s defence. Michael Olise, Cheick Doucouré and Jordan Ayew all impressed, and then there’s Eberechi Eze: a broken man in his substitute appearance at Brighton in March, but just two months later he’s in the England squad. Édouard and Mateta still aren’t convincing up front, though.Biggest surprise The return of Roy. At the time it felt like his comeback represented the failure of a project that fans had bought into – a new style and new generation. That it took Roy and Ray Lewington to make it click was something no one saw coming.Best/worst away fans Man United were loud. Everton were silent.Moment that made me smile The ecstatic, unbridled celebrations at Selhurst when Mateta scored the winner against Leicester with the last kick. It was the end of a terrible run, and a win in Roy’s first game. Perfection. Chris Waters @Clapham_Grand90+4. #CPFC | #CRYLEI pic.twitter.com/KfgSA5hiv3— Crystal Palace F.C. (@CPFC) April 1, 2023EvertonQuite the most disastrous season. Everything that could go wrong has. A squad bereft of goals and with a suspect defence was always going to struggle. Lampard was inexplicably retained by Moshiri and the board after an aggregate two-game league and cup 7-1 loss to Bournemouth before the World Cup – and they compounded that decision by not firing him until late January. Dyche has improved results, and our destiny remains in our control, but to even be in this position says everything about the appalling manner in which the club has been run in the Moshiri era. However, a vociferous bear pit at Goodison today will see the fans dragging the club over the line for the second successive season. 1/10Stars/flops Pickford has excelled and, in my opinion, is the best keeper in the league by some distance. Honourable mention to McNeil in recent weeks. Too many flops, Maupay particularly.Biggest surprise The board’s decision to vilify their own fanbase, and the regular feed of pro-board, anti-fan messages in favoured print media.Best/worst away fans Brighton were best, great to see a club being rewarded for doing things well. Newcastle fans the worst, for just being Newcastle fans.Moment that made me smile Has to be Ben Godfrey winding up Haaland at the Etihad. Haaland lost it and ran away after a crude tackle on Mykolenko. The Esk TheEsk.org; @TheEskNeal Maupay: among Everton’s flops. Photograph: Michael Zemanek/ShutterstockFulhamMany “experts” tipped us for relegation, so a comfortable 10th is superb. Marco Silva alone deserves 10/10 – with maybe half a point docked for those Old Trafford shenanigans.Stars/flops Most have improved immeasurably under Silva (and Boa Morte), notably Tim Ream and Kenny Tete, and the team ethic and spirit was evident from the off as we gave Liverpool a real fright. João Palhinha patrolled midfield magnificently, Bernd Leno kept goal with authority, Andreas Pereira and Willian added application to their skills. Few disappointed, but Mbabu and Chalobah didn’t shine. Top of the flops has to be the appalling use of VAR (Variously Applied Rules). So much for “clear and obvious”; and so much for a coherent and uniform approach. Ironically, the plethora of camera angles has just served to highlight the different assessments of similar incidents, often on the same day.Biggest surprise Was our squad being so competitive. Newcastle and Arsenal were setbacks, but otherwise we were a match for anyone. And that included City, who needed some generous interpretations of the rules in both games. Less surprising, alas, is the hike in ticket prices for next season at a time when many are finding it tough.Best/worst away fans Sunderland fans made a lot of noise. Villa’s didn’t.Moment that made me smile Finishing above Chelsea for the first time since 1983, aided by Carlos Vinícius’s headed winner against them at the Cottage. Having initially struggled as Mighty Mitro’s stand-in, he grew in confidence after that cult-hero moment. David Lloyd @DMLTOOFIFJoão Palhinha: patrolled midfield magnificently. Photograph: Jed Leicester/ShutterstockLeedsPeople could write studies on how Leeds surged to the top, threatening to gatecrash the established elite with a thrilling team, only to throw it all away in two short seasons. Or they can just update the studies already written on Leeds United 2002-2004 with new chapters about blowing it again, in 2021‑2023. Nothing about Marcelo Bielsa makes it impossible for a club to build upon what he leaves, but everything about the way Leeds have been run has ruined what he did for us. The board hired the wrong coach, Jesse Marsch, then bought the wrong players for the wrong tactics. I don’t think it’s coincidence that we’re going down with Southampton, both looking at our Red Bull playbooks with buyer’s remorse. Even if we stay up today – it’s unlikely! – that won’t disguise the failure. 0/10Premier League 2022-23 fans’ verdicts, part two: Leicester to WolvesRead moreStars/flops Wilf Gnonto turned out to be a wonderkid, only signed on deadline day with the club in a flap after loaning Dan James to Fulham to make room for Cody Gakpo (lol). Tyler Adams was good enough, and if he wasn’t injured we might have got to safety. Lots of flops, but Weston McKennie redefined letdown.Biggest surprise This season is absolute trademark Leeds United Football Club. Not surprised by any of it.Best and worst away fans Palace were best, because they seemed too surprised about winning 5-1 to gloat much. Manchester City were humdrum.Moment that made me smile A power surge knocked out VAR comms just after kick-off against Arsenal at Elland Road. Twenty minutes of blissful lo-tech confusion followed. Switching it off then on again was as good a tactic as any Leeds tried this season. Daniel Chapman thesquareball.net; @MoscowhiteTSBWilf Gnonto: turned out to be a wonderkid.

Photograph: Ciro de Luca/ReutersClubs over the past decade such as Manchester United and Spurs have turned to José Mourinho only when they are already on a downswing. Photograph: Ciro de Luca/ReutersInside footballJosé MourinhoJosé Mourinho, the anti-Barça, may have gone out of style but he still mattersJonathan WilsonThere is something magnificent about the Roma manager’s Europa Cup final date with Sevilla on WednesdaySat 27 May 2023 15.00 EDTPerhaps it’s different if you live in Italy or if Serie A is the league you follow most closely. Perhaps, then, José Mourinho is still a cussed ball of fury, bearing ancient grudges, determined never to relinquish a slight, real or imagined, the Keyser Söze of the dugout, the Karla of the press conference, manipulating and plotting, radiating paranoia as he insists his club is the victim of a conspiracy by the referees, the media and the football authorities.But if not, there was something almost heartwarming about Roma’s 0-0 draw at Bayer Leverkusen in the second leg of their Europa League semi-final. He’s still doing it! He hasn’t changed! 28% possession. One shot on target to Leverkusen’s 23. The ball in play for just 54 minutes, despite 14 minutes of injury time. An xG of 0.03. This was a celebration of mourinhismo, a Camp Nou 2010 for the modern age. He had a lead from the first leg, so why should he attack?José Mourinho reveals ‘deep feelings’ for all his former clubs – except TottenhamRead moreFor 15 years the game at elite level has been about possession and the high press, about playing on the front foot, but when Barcelona preferred Pep Guardiola over Mourinho in 2008, it confirmed what he had always suspected: that the club had never fully accepted him when he had been a coach there in the late 90s; that they would always side with their own; that he would become the anti-Barça; that if they wanted to play with the ball, he would play without it.His Porto and his Chelsea both pressed to an extent – it was only after that rejection that he retreated fully into the shadows, became the Sauron of anti-football, preaching, in direct contradistinction to Guardiola, his doctrine that he who has the ball has fear. In that sense his entire post-Chelsea career can be seen as an extended passive-aggressive sulk. And after this long, there is something rather magnificent about that.The past 15 years have had their moments. Having been jilted, Mourinho has not withdrawn, Miss Havisham-like, to a mouldering mansion, plotting to break the heart of an idealistic protege – although André Villas-Boas’s heart ended up broken by football anyway. He has been in the arena. His achievements with Internazionale were remarkable, and that semi-final second leg in 2010, victory through defeat with 10 men and 19% possession, represented his great revenge over Barcelona, greater than finally ending Guardiola’s run of success by winning La Liga with Real Madrid in 2011-12.Guardiola seemed exhausted by the end of their two-year tussle in Spain, but hindsight suggests the struggle took more out of Mourinho. Even that final league title at Chelsea was followed by dismissal in the December of the next season. Since when there have been anti-climactic stints at Manchester United and Tottenham – although subsequent history perhaps calls for reassessment.Mourinho did, after all, lead United to second in the Premier League, as well as claiming the League Cup and the Europa League. United have not matched the 81 points they won under Mourinho in 2017-18 since, nor had they won another trophy until the League Cup this season.Mourinho took Spurs to sixth then had them seventh when he was sacked a week before the 2021 League Cup final: that may not seem a huge achievement, and Tottenham did qualify for the Champions League under Antonio Conte the following season, but nobody could realistically claim that the club’s situation now is better than when Mourinho left.Josè Mourinho celebrates Roma’s Europa League victory against Bayer Leverkusen, a win that secured another final for the Portuguese coach. Photograph: Fabio Rossi/AS Roma/Getty ImagesIt is not as simple, though, as suggesting that a club dwindling exculpates Mourinho, that he bravely fought the impulse to failure. Nor, though, does it seem likely that the toxicity he tends to leave behind can extend so long, that he has been the cause of the problems. Rather it is probably that clubs over the past decade have turned to Mourinho only when they are already on a downswing, that he is their Hail Mary to arrest decline: far easier, after all, to hope a charismatic brooder can shake things up than actually implement a proper process of reform.Mourinho could have faded away. He is 60, and surely doesn’t need the money. But football has a hold on him yet. He is not now that which once he was but how dull it is to rust unburnished, not to shine in use.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Football DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But he is no longer in the vanguard of tactical development and the decision to be the anti-Barça, indeed, means he is consciously archaic, like a Lancashire weaver making a virtue of the fact his cloth was produced not with a spinning jenny but on a handloom.Voldemort in charge of the Death Star: the glorious prospect of Mourinho at PSG | Barney RonayRead moreHe is like Neil Warnock or Steve Davis or John Major, a figure from the past whose irritating idiosyncrasies have become somehow consoling in their familiarity, who offers a nostalgic bridge to the past, a past that wasn’t perfect but in which the implacable agents of unpleasant foreign regimes at least had the decency to pretend they were just everyday oligarchs. (And almost all people in sport are inherently nostalgic, happy enough in the end just to sit with their litany of half-forgotten names).Mourinho hasn’t changed. In the past few weeks he has worn a wire because of a referee he doesn’t trust, seen an assistant sent off for grabbing an opponent and administered a textbook drive-by to the Tottenham chairman, “President Levy”. But these are the hits people want to hear him play (at least for now; it might be different if he does return to the mainstream at Paris Saint-Germain).Twenty years after his first Uefa Cup final, when his Porto, time-wasting and feigning injury in what would become recognised as the grand Mourinho style, beat Celtic in Seville, he is in another one, this time against Sevilla and this time with Roma. It is not the elite level any more. Roma’s net spend last summer was minus €58m. Mourinho is no longer striving with gods. But he won the inaugural Conference League last year and he is still annoying people. Some work of noble note may yet be done.TopicsJosé MourinhoInside footballRomaEuropa LeagueChelseaTottenham HotspurPep GuardiolacommentReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedSoccerLive scoresTablesFixturesResultsCompetitionsClubsNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Photograph: Marla Aufmuth/Getty Images for Massachusetts Conference for WomenThe ObserverFrench Open 2023Bianca Andreescu: ‘You’re alone on court. It’s like a lonely, lonely journey’Canadian has recovered quickly from a brutal ankle injury and is stronger than ever mentally after a break from the gameTumaini Carayol in ParisSat 27 May 2023 13.00 EDTAfter an arduous time on the road this year, Bianca Andreescu’s fortunes finally appeared to be turning on her favoured American hardcourts at the beginning of spring. In Miami, she defeated world No 10, Maria Sakkari, en route to the fourth round of the WTA 1000 event. She was on song.But while she was battling Ekaterina Alexandrova in the fourth round, disaster struck. Early in the second set, Andreescu landed badly on her ankle and fell. As she waited for the medical team, clearly in shock, Andreescu cried and screamed in pain and frustration.“First of all, it was the worst pain I’ve ever felt,” says Andreescu. “And second, I was thinking: ‘Why me? Why again?’ and in Miami too, every time I’m in Miami – 2019, 2021, 2023, I’m playing really good tennis, and then I get injured.”Rolling in the deep: why tennis players are backing off against serveRead moreThis time, unlike other occasions in her young career since winning the US Open in 2019, the worst-case scenario was avoided. The 22-year-old worked hard on rehabilitating her ankle and she returned a month later in Madrid. “I just tried my best to stay positive. It wasn’t easy. But at one point, I felt a sense of peace, that it was supposed to happen in a way,” says Andreescu.At the beginning of last season, Andreescu’s mental-health struggles led her to take a break from the sport. She travelled, volunteered in a domestic violence shelter and saw the world beyond tennis. Her crisis came when she recognised that her self-worth was too tied up in her results. “I started at age seven, we kind of identify ourselves as a sports person. And we kind of forget about the human being,” she says.As she stepped away, she seriously considered whether to continue. “As a young athlete, I was doing really, really well in the juniors, ITFs. And then my first year in the pros, I won the freaking US Open. I knew what it was to win, basically.“And then when I started losing, I didn’t know what was happening in a way. I didn’t know how to deal with it. I was shocked, which was really weird because people are losing every single week in tennis. And now I know how it feels. I’ve been through it and I’m glad that I did because I was able to realise that if I want to have a long career, I can’t continue like that.”Andreescu has come to view her sport with a far greater perspective now. “There are more important things out there than winning or losing or even just playing tennis. I’m very grateful to play but having food on the table is more important, amazing parents, supportive friends, little things like that. Thinking about that has really helped me shift my perspective.”Bianca Andreescu knows there are more important things to life than tennis after taking a break from the game. Photograph: Robert Prange/Getty ImagesThree weeks ago, Amanda Anisimova, a French Open semi-finalist aged 17 in 2019, announced she would be taking a break due to struggling with her mental health and burnout. “It’s become unbearable being at tennis tournaments,” she wrote.Andreescu says she sent Anisimova a message and would be there to chat if she wanted. “It takes a lot of guts to do something like that. For me it took a lot because you’re not only thinking about yourself, but you have to think about everybody else around you and to be able to take that step is incredible. So I condone her for that. And I think it’s probably going to be the best decision she’s ever made.”Tennis can be mentally draining, which Andreescu explains by listing all of the challenges, from the near-endless season to the stress of being an employer, the constant abuse from gamblers – and loneliness. “You’re alone out there, you’re alone on the court, you don’t have anyone really helping you. It’s like a lonely, lonely journey in a way. But if you try to find love in the process, that’s the most important thing, basically, love and appreciation,” she says.Nowadays, Andreescu is trying to find a balance between throwing herself into her career and maintaining perspective. On court, she has changed much of her team this year. Off court, it means spending more time actually viewing the cities she visits, making beats on SoundCloud, playing sudoku and watching reality shows such as Love is Blind.On whether her interest in reality TV would translate to her wanting to be in the second season of Netflix’s Break Point tennis docu-series, Andreescu says she declined last year but would now. “I didn’t want to be bombarded with all the cameras at the time. But if they’re going to make a new season I would love to be a part of it. I feel like my personality will be interesting.” Andreescu’s personality would, of course, bring plenty of drama, an assertion she does not dispute. “The drama queen,” she adds.Since returning from her ankle injury, Andreescu has lost her two matches. She heads into the French Open at zero, trying to build momentum anew and doing so on clay, a still-unfamiliar surface. At the same time, though, Andreescu has seen a lot in her short time on tour and seems far better equipped for whatever is to come.TopicsFrench Open 2023The ObserverFrench OpenTennisfeaturesReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedSoccerNFLTennisMLBMLSNBANHLF1GolfNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

According to McCarthy there are no new taxes and the bill includes “historic reductions in spending, consequential reforms that will lift people out of poverty and into the workforce.”“I expect to finish the writing of the bill, checking with the White House and speaking to the president again tomorrow afternoon, and then posting the text of it tomorrow, and then we vote on it on Wednesday,” McCarthy said.The deal still needs to receive approval from the divided Congress, and McCarthy will probably need some support from Democratic members to get the proposal through the House, given Republicans’ narrow majority in the lower chamber.US House speaker Kevin McCarthy stops to speak with reporters after reaching a tentative deal to raise the United States' debt ceiling Photograph: Nathan Howard/ReutersThe deal would avert an economically destabilising default which the Treasury Department warned would occur if the debt ceiling was not raised by 5 June.Republicans who control the House of Representatives have pushed for steep cuts to spending and for funds to be stripped from the Internal Revenue Service, the US tax agency.Both sides have suggested one of the main holdups had been a Republican effort to boost work requirements for recipients of food stamps and other federal aid programs, a longtime Republican goal that many Democrats have strenuously opposed.Exact details of the final deal were not immediately available, but negotiators have agreed to cap non-defence discretionary spending at 2023 levels for two years, in exchange for a debt ceiling increase over a similar period, sources told Reuters earlier.The two sides have to carefully thread the needle in finding a compromise that can clear the House, with a 222-213 Republican majority, and Senate, with a 51-49 Democratic majority.The long standoff spooked financial markets, weighing on stocks and forcing the United States to pay record-high interest rates in some bond sales. A default would take a far heavier toll, economists say, likely pushing the nation into recession, shaking the world economy and leading to a spike in unemployment.Biden for months refused to negotiate with McCarthy over future spending cuts, demanding that lawmakers first pass a “clean” debt-ceiling increase free of other conditions, and present a 2024 budget proposal to counter his issued in March. Two-way negotiations between Biden and McCarthy began in earnest on 16 May.Democrats accused Republicans of playing a dangerous game of brinkmanship with the economy. Republicans say recent increased government spending is fueling the growth of the US debt, which is now roughly equal to the annual output of the economy.McCarthy has vowed to give House members 72 hours to read the legislation before bringing it to the floor for a vote. That will test whether enough moderate members support the compromises in the bill to overcome opposition from both hard-right Republicans and progressive Democrats.Then it will need to pass the Senate, where it will need at least nine Republican votes to succeed. There are multiple opportunities in each chamber along the way to slow down the process.TopicsUS politicsJoe BidenKevin McCarthynewsReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedUSWorldEnvironmentSoccerUS PoliticsBusinessTechScienceNewslettersFight for democracyNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

In May 2022 a white supremacist killed 10 Black people at a Tops supermarket in Buffalo, New York. The attacker said he had chosen the location because it was in a predominantly Black neighborhood. He was sentenced to life in prison earlier this year.A self-described white nationalist killed 23 people and injured 22 in a shooting in El Paso, on the border of Mexico and the US, in 2019, in an anti-immigration attack targeting Hispanic people.In recent years a white supremacist killed nine people at a Black church in Charleston, while just this week a man was arrested after he crashed a rented truck into bollards near the White House. The man subsequently praised Adolf Hitler to investigators and said he intended to “kill the president”, according to charging documents.​Michael Jensen, senior researcher at the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (Start) at the University of Maryland, said 70% of individuals committing terrorist acts in the US are individuals, or part of “isolated cliques” – small groups of three to four people.“That said, these individuals might be lone actors, but they’re not lonely actors,” Jensen said.“They are embedded in these online ecosystems where they are exchanging ideas with each other all day every day.”Jensen leads the Profiles of Individual Radicalization in the United States (Pirus) project, a database tracking how US extremists came to be radicalized.According to the data, 90% of the cases of US terrorists are classed as domestic. Of the domestic extremists, 95% are far-right, Jensen said: white supremacists, Proud Boys, anti-immigrant groups and anti-government groups.There has been a worrying increase in the number of attacks. Prior to 2016, Jensen and his team logged about 150 individuals a year who were “committing crimes inspired by extremist ideology”.Since 2016, the number of people committing such crimes has jumped to about 300-350 cases a year, Jensen said – not including a huge spike in 2021 as a result of the January 6 insurrection.As the number of incidents have risen, there have been changes in how people come to rightwing terrorism.“Before the internet and before social media, how an individual was likely to radicalize is that it was going to be through a face-to-face relationship that they had in the physical world,” Jensen said.“So they had a cousin that was involved in a skinhead gang and they recruited them, or there was a group active in their neighborhood and they saw a flyer and took an interest in it.“It was a much more labor intensive process to get people involved.”With the advent of social media, white supremacist ideas and groups are available “at the click of a button”, Jensen said. Individuals have a much easier path to becoming radicalized.At the same time, the threat of rightwing terrorism has been exacerbated by the normalizing of political violence, or violent rhetoric, by elected officials and media personalities. Prominent figures can provide a gateway for people to commit violence when they demonize immigrants, the LGBTQ+ community, or indulge conspiracies like the great replacement theory, Jensen said.“They get this disinformation and conspiracy theories that are a bit more watered down: does not make calls to violence, but they provide the mechanisms for people to follow that narrative to the places where they will encounter that rhetoric.”Susan Corke, Intelligence Project Director at the Southern Poverty Law Center, said the far right has been “increasingly mobilized since the beginning of the Trump era”.‘You wear Walmart khakis’: US cyclist who taunted fascist group wins plauditsRead more“Currently, the level of mobilization, coordination and sustained focus of the far right’s anti-LGBTQ+, particularly anti-trans, is much worse.“The past year saw unprecedented violence against transgender and gender-nonconforming people, and the most frequent victims were women of color, especially black transgender women,” Corke said.Corke said terror attacks by individuals should be seen within the wider context of hate-filled rhetoric and extremist platforms.“While a shooter or someone who takes violent action may act on their own, I would say that they are not solo actors,” she said.“People do not ‘self-radicalize’ – they exist within social and political structures that perpetuate these ideas, often through deliberate disinformation and active recruitment from groups espousing hateful ideologies.”Corke said the way to combat and prevent rightwing terrorism is to educate young people and work towards early intervention.“Communities and governments need to adopt a public health approach to preventing extremism by engaging communities, mental health experts, social workers and, especially, people involved in the day-to-day lives of young people,” she said.In 2021 a report by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence – the head of the US Intelligence Community – warned that racially motivated extremists posed the most lethal domestic terrorism threat. It echoed post-January 6 warnings from Christopher Wray, the director of the FBI, that the threat from domestic violent extremism was “metastasizing” across the country.But despite the FBI and US intelligence pronouncements, a major problem with combating rightwing terrorism is that law enforcement does not adequately track of instances of violence, said Michael German, a former FBI special agent infiltrated white supremacy groups in the 1990s who now works at the Brennan Center for Justice.“The FBI doesn’t know how many people white supremacists killed last year in the United States. They don’t collect that information,” German said.When attacks by white supremacists do happen, “they often get parsed in a way that minimizes them,” he said. White supremacist violence is frequently recorded under the category of gang violence, rather than domestic terrorism, while attacks conducted by individuals who have far-right beliefs are frequently classified as hate crimes – outside of the domestic terrorism umbrella.“You would think that if the FBI and the justice department had a real interest in significantly suppressing this type of crime, they would at least count them,” German said.Proud Boys and Oath Keepers: what is their future with top leaders jailed?Read moreGerman said a significant change from the time he spent undercover to investigating neo-Nazi organizations in the 1990s to the modern environment is the language elected officials use to talk about certain groups.“Back in the 90s there were Republicans who used dog whistle politics, they used phrases and arguments that the far-right militant crowd understood as speaking to them about their issues,” German said.“Now you see sitting politicians who exalt in violence, and call for more of it and call for exonerating the people who committed violence because they committed violence in furtherance of their political cause.”That’s the kind of rhetoric that led to the January 6 insurrection, German said – and could continue to cause problems in the future.“If the government is saying: ‘Do it, and do it for me, and I’ll pardon you, or I’ll pay your legal bills, which are things that are said today. Then it’s easier [for members of the far right] to say: ‘Okay, this is this is authorized.’“That’s how you get 10,000 people attacking the US Capitol.”TopicsThe far rightUS politicsUS Capitol attacknewsReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedUSWorldEnvironmentSoccerUS PoliticsBusinessTechScienceNewslettersFight for democracyNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

This position is handpicked by Beijing, and he predictably lost.Since its inception the party has aspired to become a “governing” force, instead of pushing back “just for the sake of opposition”.At its peak of popularity, the Civic party was the second-largest group in the opposition camp – pocketing six seats in Hong Kong’s half-elected legislature in 2012.“We had our eyes fixed on the benchmark of democracy,” said Leong in the party’s farewell letter on Saturday. “History goes in circles … While the Civic party has not accomplished what we set out to do, there is a time for everything.”Since 2019, when the financial hub was upended by huge, and at times violent, pro-democracy protests, half a dozen of the party’s key members have faced criminal convictions for taking part in demonstrations and attempting to raise funds for protesters.They also took part in unofficial political primaries within the pro-democracy camp – which was deemed a national security risk – and four were charged with “conspiracy to subversion”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterArchie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morningPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Photograph: Mirrorpix/Getty ImagesThe ObserverExplorationWas ‘the first man to reach the North Pole’ a fraud?Frederick Cook claimed to have reached the top of the world, but a new book says he was lyingVanessa ThorpeSun 28 May 2023 05.00 EDTWho was the first person to reach the north pole? According to American adventurer Frederick Cook, it was him. But now a new book will set out the evidence that the explorer’s 114-year-old claim was an instance of fake news on a global scale.In The Explorer and the Journalist, author Richard Evans has examined the greatest scandal in polar history, reigniting a debate that has smouldered since September 1909, when Cook, who had been missing for a year, sent out a telegram announcing he had reached the pole in 1908.The son of German immigrants, Cook grew up in the foothills of New York state’s Catskill Mountains. He quickly became a popular hero, embraced by scientists because of his humble attitude and the credit he gave to the Inuit. “He had a mild manner that made him seem genuine and believable,” said Evans. “And he was seen as a kind of antidote to all the big personalities of other explorers, like his fellow American Robert Peary, and the Norwegian Roald Amundsen.”Cook’s eventual undoing came in the shape of a British journalist, Philip Gibbs, who was sent by his newspaper, the Daily Chronicle, to secure the first interview with the triumphant American. Tracking him down to his berth on a boat off the coast of Denmark, Gibbs joined Cook for a fateful breakfast in the dining saloon, writing in his memoir: “I was favourably impressed by the first appearance of the man who says he reached the pole.“Here, surely, was a typical sea rover. Under his Danish cap there was a mass of shaggy fair hair, a pair of smiling blue eyes, and a florid face with a powerful nose and a large mouth which, when he smiled, showed broken teeth. An honest face, surely, if any face is honest.”Gibbs was keen to get the polar scoop. But as the putative explorer started to avoid the topic of his exploits, the reporter’s doubts grew. Cook had already made his name as part of the Belgica expedition, the first group to over-winter in Antarctica. And on that southern trip he had earned a favourable reputation by prescribing fresh meat to fight off scurvy and coming up with an idea to free the boat from ice. Also on board the Belgica was a young Amundsen, who remained a lifelong admirer of Cook even after scandal struck.A photograph that Cook claimed was of him and two Inuit men at the North Pole. Photograph: ullstein bild/Getty Images“I read Gibbs’s memoir about six years ago and it kept drawing me back,” said Evans, whose book was published last week. “I have set my book in Copenhagen in that year because at that moment it was like the centre of the world, with all the rival polar explorers and their backers in one place. Most journalists would have given their eye teeth for the kind of early access that Gibbs got. But although the Scientific Society in Copenhagen really believed Cook, Gibbs pushed on with his doubts and got his paper to publish this potentially libellous piece, suggesting that Cook was lying.”When Gibbs filed his sceptical, explosive accusations he was 32 years old and on his fifth job in Fleet Street. The Cook story permanently elevated him to the rank of the leading British journalists of his day. Polar scholars have obsessed over details of the competing claims ever since. But after assessing the case and laying out the counterclaims, Evans concludes Gibbs was on to the truth: “For what it is worth, I agree.”Lack of evidence was Cook’s main problem. He had told Gibbs his notes would prove his claim, but said he had given them to someone to take to New York. Conclusive documents never materialised.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterArchie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morningPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Peary soon accused Cook of lying, while Cook attempted to rise above the allegations. Today, many believe both men were lying.Cook went back to America to ride out the reputational storm, earning big money as a lecturer, but questions about his honesty persisted. Before his north pole expedition, he had been best known as the first person to reach the top of Mount McKinley – now called Denali – in Alaska. But when doubters looked back at this claim it seemed that the photograph of the summit Cook had submitted looked just like another much lower one in the range.Some people still argue that Cook did reach the pole, and he himself spent the rest of his life trying to establish his claim. He went on to become a Texas oilman and was later accused of fraud, spending six years in prison.While the race to the south pole has a clear winner in Amundsen, the truth about the race to the north pole is uncertain.Some now give the credit to Amundsen once more, because he flew over it in an airship in 1926. American Ralph Plaisted reached it on a snowmobile in 1968 and British explorer Sir Walter Herbert got there on foot a year later.TopicsExplorationThe ObserverArcticAntarcticanewsReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedUSWorldEnvironmentSoccerUS PoliticsBusinessTechScienceNewslettersFight for democracyNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

No charges have been filed and Chanana has not responded to the claims. There have also been concerns over hundreds of thousands of pounds donated to the Conservatives by benefactors linked to Russia.“The UK’s current rules do not provide a sufficiently robust safeguard to protect our electoral system from the effects of foreign money,” said Lord Evans. “Our 2021 report included important recommendations to mitigate these risks.“The changes we proposed were not radical or bureaucratic, but they could have a significant impact on the integrity of our electoral system. We would urge the government to take them forward as a matter of urgency.”Karan Chanana, a food tycoon from India, donated more than £220,000 to the Conservatives through a UK subsidiary. Photograph: Stuart C Wilson/Getty ImagesParties are banned from taking money from foreign donors, but critics argue that there are loopholes rules designed to prohibit foreign donations under the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 (PPERA).An amendment to the national security bill that would have required political parties to carry out due diligence on the true source of donations was voted down by the government this month.Labour has accused the Tories of being “asleep at the wheel” over the influence and sources of foreign money.Labour party chair Anneliese Dodds said: “With recent news that Tory donors have links to alleged money laundering, fraud, corruption and other unacceptable activities, the question is: is there anyone the Conservatives won’t accept money from?“Rishi Sunak and the Conservatives have serious questions to answer. They need to come clean about what due diligence they carry out on their donors – and why it appears to be so inadequate. They also have to explain why they whipped their peers to vote against an amendment to close loopholes on foreign donations.”Amira G Foods, controlled by Chanana, was among the new corporate donors supporting the Tories in the run-up to Boris Johnson’s landslide election victory in December 2019. Ben Elliot, appointed co-chair of the Conservative party in July 2019, presided over a surge in donations, with the party receiving more than £37m in the last quarter of the year, a record figure and more than that given over the same period to all the other parties combined.The Tories have previously been challenged by Labour over whether they would keep donations from Britannia Financial Group, which also first donated in the same period. The group, which has its headquarters in London and is controlled by the Venezuelan-Italian banker Julio Herrera Velutini, according to corporate filings, is a client of Hawthorn Advisors, the public relations firm co-founded by Elliot.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterArchie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morningPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He has pleaded not guilty to the charges, which his lawyers have said are baseless and politically motivated.“It’s quite obvious there need to be much tighter rules on political donations from individuals, companies or other types of entities,” said Steve Goodrich, head of research and investigations at Transparency International UK. “The government [is] worryingly complacent, and there has been a lack of curiosity about the provenance of funds which parties have been accepting.”A Conservative party spokesperson said they only accept donations from permissible sources, namely individuals registered on the UK’s electoral roll or UK registered companies.““Donations are properly and transparently declared to the Electoral Commission, openly published by them and comply fully with the law.”A government spokesperson said: “Transparency of electoral funding is a key cornerstone of the UK’s electoral system. It is an offence for a political party to accept a donation from a foreign donor, and we have introduced a new requirement on political parties to declare their assets and liabilities over £500 upon registration, as recommended by the committee on standards in public life.”Britannia Financial Group declined to comment.TopicsParty fundingThe ObserverConservativesElectoral reformEthicsIndianewsReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedUKWorldClimate crisisNewslettersFootballCoronavirusBusinessEnvironmentUK politicsEducationSocietyScienceTechGlobal developmentObituariesNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Let’s not forget that,” she wrote on Twitter.The winning film, starring German actor Sandra Hüller, is the French director’s second to be selected to compete on the Cote D’Azur, after her dark comedy Sibyl.Hüller, best known for her role in 2016 comedy-drama Toni Erdmann, also featured in another leading contender for the top prize at Cannes this year, British director Jonathan Glazer’s The Zone of Interest. In Triet’s film she plays a writer forced to defend herself as the main suspect in her husband’s murder.A curious choice for the Palme – but what an extraordinary CannesRead moreThe sought-after top film prize, awarded by a team of judges that was led by last year’s winner – director of The Triangle of Sadness, Ruben Östlund – was presented by veteran Hollywood actor Jane Fonda at the annual film festival’s sparkling closing ceremony.“The first time that I came was 1963,” said Fonda, as she prepared to give the famous award to Triet. “The festival was smaller then. There were no women directors competing at that time and it never even occurred to us that there was something wrong with that. We have come a long way, but we have a long way to go.”Seven female directors, Fonda pointed out, had films in the competition this year. “It is historic,” said Fonda. “But one day it will be normal.”Triet, who is the third woman to win the prestigious award, beat other contenders including British director Ken Loach, a festival favourite, whose new film The Old Oak premiered at the Palais at the end of the festival.Glazer did not walk away empty-handed; he won the grand prize for The Zone of Interest, his adaptation of a Martin Amis novel that nightmarishly describes the domestic concerns of a Nazi family who live in close proximity to the Auschwitz concentration camp in Poland towards the end of the second world war.Glazer is best known for his critical hits Sexy Beast and Under the Skin, a sci-fi dystopia which starred Scarlett Johansson as an alien. Accepting the award, he said: “This is an honour beyond my dreams. I want to honour the memory of Martin Amis and am so glad that I got to show the film to him.”The best acting prize went to the Japanese acting legend Koji Yakusho, for his portrayal of a reticent, tree-loving Tokyo toilet cleaner in Wim Wenders’s film Perfect Days. It is a performance in which the complexity of the character’s feelings for the natural world around him, and the details of his traumatic past as a member of a well-to-do family, become evident as the story slowly unfolds and he deals with the characters he meets.Best actress went to Merve Dizdar, star of the Turkish drama About Dry Grasses from director Nuri Bilge Ceylan. Dizdar mesmerised many critics in her role as Nuray, a rural schoolteacher. “I would like to dedicate this prize to all the women who are fighting to overcome difficulties in this world, and to retain hope,” Dizdar said, as she accepted her prize.Presenting the special jury prize, British actor Orlando Bloom said that cinema’s value was the way it can bridge differences, “not always an easy feat”. He gave the prize to Finnish director Aki Kaurismäki for his film Fallen Leaves, which stars Alma Pöysti as a supermarket clerk who leads a lonely existence until she meets a heavy-drinking construction worker who also seems adrift.Best director went to Tran Anh Hung for his film The Pot-au-Feu, which features French actors Juliette Binoche and Benoît Magimel, as a revered chef, as they fall in love in the kitchen.TopicsCannes 2023The ObserverCannes film festivalnewsReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedFilmBooksMusicArt & designTV & radioStageClassicalGamesNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

It makes Paxton only the third sitting official in Texas’ nearly 200-year history to have been impeached.Paxton, 60, decried the move moments after many members of his own party voted to impeach, and his office pointed to internal reports that found no wrongdoing.“The ugly spectacle in the Texas House today confirmed the outrageous impeachment plot against me was never meant to be fair or just,” Paxton said. “It was a politically motivated sham from the beginning,”Paxton has been under FBI investigation for years over accusations that he used his office to help a donor and was separately indicted on securities fraud charges in 2015, though he has yet to stand trial. His fellow Republicans had long taken a muted stance on the allegations, but that changed this week.“No one person should be above the law, least not the top law enforcement officer of the state of Texas,” David Spiller, a Republican member of the committee that investigated Paxton, said in opening statements. Another Republican committee member Charlie Geren said without elaborating that Paxton had called some lawmakers before the vote and threatened them with political “consequences”.Lawmakers allied with Paxton tried to discredit the investigation by noting that hired investigators, not panel members, interviewed witnesses. They also said several of the investigators had voted in Democratic primaries, tainting the impeachment, and that they had too little time to review evidence.“I perceive it could be political weaponization,” Tony Tinderholt, one of the House’s most conservative members, said before the vote.Paxton is automatically suspended from office pending the Senate trial. Final removal would require a two-thirds vote in the Senate, where Paxton’s wife, Angela, is a member.Representatives of the governor, who lauded Paxton while swearing him in for a third term in January, did not immediately respond to requests for comment on a temporary replacement.Before the vote on Saturday, Trump and senator Ted Cruz came to Paxton’s defense, with Cruz calling the impeachment process “a travesty” and saying the attorney general’s legal troubles should be left to the courts.“Free Ken Paxton,” Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social, warning that if House Republicans proceeded with impeachment, “I will fight you.”TopicsTexasUS politicsDonald TrumpTed CruznewsReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedUSWorldEnvironmentSoccerUS PoliticsBusinessTechScienceNewslettersFight for democracyNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

But it is likely to have to rely on the far-fight Vox party’s support in forming new regional governments in all of the contested regions except Madrid.The elections come at the end of a bitter campaign in which regional and local matters have been often overshadowed by the spectre of the defunct Basque terrorist group, Eta, the row sparked by the racist abuse directed at the Real Madrid footballer Vinícius Júnior, and allegations of electoral fraud.Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, who is also the PSOE leader, had begun the campaign hoping to stress his government’s economic record, new housing reforms and schemes to help young people.But his attempts to push those achievements were swiftly derailed after it emerged that the Basque nationalist party, EH Bildu – on whose support the minority government relies in congress – was fielding 44 convicted Eta members, including seven people found guilty of violent crimes, as candidates.Although Sánchez criticised Bildu’s decision, describing it as legal but “obviously indecent”, and the Basque party saying later the seven candidates convicted for violence would not take up their seats, the damage had been done.The PP leader, Alberto Núñez Feijóo, pounced on Sánchez for his reliance on Bildu and on Catalan pro-independence parties – and for bungled sexual offences legislation that allowed more than 1,000 convicted sex offenders to have their sentences cut, and more than 100 to win early release.“You’re the great electoral hope for rapists and pederasts, for mutineers, squatters, corrupt people and now for those who used to go about in balaclavas with pistols,” he told Sánchez. “And I will never be that.”Ayuso, a climate change denier who once said the spread of Covid in the Spanish capital was partly due to “the way of life of immigrants in Madrid”, went further, claiming that “Eta is still alive” in the guise of Bildu and calling, unsuccessfully, for the legal political party to be banned. Her words were criticised by a group representing the victims of terrorism that accused her of trivialising what had happened and showing a lack of respect for the families of the dead.Eta murdered 829 people during its violent, five-decade quest to bring about an independent Basque homeland before it abandoned its armed campaign in 2011 and dissolved itself five years ago.Sánchez said the PP’s familiar obsession with a vanished terror group was proof of its lack of electoral policies. He asked the party: “What’s your proposal on housing? Eta. In other words, nothing. On education? Eta. In other words, nothing. On the climate emergency? Eta. In other words nothing.He added: “When Eta is nothing in Spain it is still everything to you. Because, in your desperation, Eta is all you have, even though it doesn’t exist.”By the middle of this week, the focus had switched to racism after Vinícius called Spain “a country of racists”.Sánchez replied: “Hatred and xenophobia should have no place in football nor in our society.”Feijóo also said racism and sport were “totally incompatible”, but added: “Spain is not a racist country in any way.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up to This is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pivotal stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He said: “If the PP grows a lot and wins a lot of territorial power – and if it outperforms expectations – then that will give rise to the perception that the left’s time is up and that Pedro Sánchez is in stoppage time.“On the other hand, if the left holds out and if the result is mixed, then the impression will be that the game’s not over when it comes to the next election.”While the PSOE will be hoping to minimise losses in the run-up to the general election, Podemos, its leftwing, junior partner in the national coalition government, is badly bereft of the momentum and support that propelled it into Spanish politics eight years ago. Meanwhile, the centre-right Citizens party, once a kingmaker and possible party of government, is set to continue its slow slide into insignificance.One of the main focuses will be on the reconfigured right. Although the PP stands to hoover up support from the moribund Citizens, it is unlikely to perform well enough to avoid the need for deals with Vox, with whom it already governs the region of Castilla y León. Such deals, however, would come at a price as they would allow the left to question the PP’s credentials as a centre-right party and paint it as all too prepared to enter into cynical alliances with the far right.“Vox is growing in all regions and is going to win more power and be in more regional parliaments and in more councils than in 2019,” said Simón. “Second – and this is important – all the surveys show that the PP will need Vox to govern in every region except in Madrid. That means that Vox, which is running a very discreet campaign and is trying not to make any mistakes, will be seeking to enter into coalition governments.”TopicsSpainPedro SánchezEuropeEtanewsReuse this contentMore on this storyMore on this storySpain’s former king to return from self-exile for sailing regatta18 Apr 2023Airport meeting lands Spanish minister in Venezuela controversy24 Jan 2020Spain's PM calls for calm after building his coalition government12 Jan 2020Socialists and Podemos to rule together in Spanish coalition7 Jan 2020Spain's far-right Vox blocks violence against women declaration25 Nov 2019Socialist ex-presidents of Andalucía guilty in €680m fraud case19 Nov 2019The Guardian view on Spain’s election: progressive parties must unite to defeat the far right11 Nov 2019Spain likely to return to the polls in November after party talks fail17 Sept 2019Most viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Photograph: Gilbert Rondilla Photography/Getty ImagesThe ObserverAstronomyStars could be invisible within 20 years as light pollution brightens night skiesThe increased use of light-emitting diodes is obscuring our view of the Milky Way as well as taking a toll on human and wildlife healthRobin McKieSat 27 May 2023 09.01 EDTThe Herefordshire hills basked in brilliant sunshine last weekend. Summer had arrived and the skies were cloudless, conditions that would once have heralded succeeding nights of coal-dark heavens sprinkled with brilliant stars, meteorites and planets.It was not to be. The night sky was not so much black as dark grey with only a handful of stars glimmering against this backdrop. The Milky Way – which would once have glittered across the heavens – was absent. Summer’s advent had again revealed a curse of modern times: light pollution.The increased use of light-emitting diodes (LED) and other forms of lighting are now brightening the night sky at a dramatic rate, scientists have found. Indiscriminate use of external lighting, street illumination, advertising, and illuminated sporting venues is now blinding our view of the stars.In 2016, astronomers reported that the Milky Way was no longer visible to a third of humanity and light pollution has worsened considerably since then. At its current rate most of the major constellations will be indecipherable in 20 years, it is estimated. The loss, culturally and scientifically, will be intense.“The night sky is part of our environment and it would be a major deprivation if the next generation never got to see it, just as it would be if they never saw a bird’s nest,” said Martin Rees, the astronomer royal. “You don’t need to be an astronomer to care about this. I am not an ornithologist but if there were no songbirds in my garden, I’d feel impoverished.”Rees is a founder of the all-party parliamentary group for dark skies which recently produced a report calling for a host of measures to counter the curse of light pollution. These include proposals to appoint a minister for dark skies, create a commission for dark skies and set strict standards for the density and direction of lighting.The introduction of a carefully selected package of planning rules to control obtrusive light – backed by legal clout and penalties for non-compliance – could make major differences, the committee stressed. The alternative would be to lose sight of night skies “painted with unnumber’d sparks,” to quote Shakespeare’s Julius Caesar.Research by physicist Christopher Kyba, of the German Centre for Geosciences has revealed that light pollution is now causing the night sky to brighten at a rate of around 10% a year, an increase that threatens to obliterate the sight of all but the most brilliant stars in a generation. A child born where 250 stars are visible at night today would only be able to see about 100 by the time they reach 18.Sea turtles are among the wildlife adversely affected by light pollution.  Photograph: AlamyGazing at a night sky crossed by a glittering Milky Way has become a splendour of another age, Kyba told the Observer. “A couple of generations ago, people would have been confronted regularly with this glittering vision of the cosmos – but what was formerly universal is now extremely rare. Only the world’s richest people, and some of the poorest, experience that any more. For everybody else, it’s more or less gone.” Nevertheless, the introduction of only a modest number of changes to lighting could make a considerable improvement, Kyba argued. These moves would include ensuring outdoor lights are carefully shielded, point downwards, have limits placed on their brightness, and are not predominantly blue-white but have red and orange components.“Measures like that would have an enormous impact,” he added.The problem is that light pollution is still not perceived by the public to be a threat. As Professor Oscar Corcho, of Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, has put it: “The negative consequences of light pollution are as unknown by the population as those of smoking in the 80s.”Yet action is now urgently needed. Apart from its astronomical and cultural impact, light pollution is having serious ecological consequences. Sea turtles and migrating birds are guided by moonlight. Light pollution causes them to get confused and lose their way. Insects, a key source of food for birds and other animals, get drawn to artificial lights and are immediately killed upon contact with the source.The case against light pollution goes further. Bluish emissions of LEDs are almost entirely lacking any red or near infrared light, said Prof Robert Fosbury, of the Institute of Ophthalmology at University College London (UCL). “We are becoming starved of red and infra-red light and that has serious implications,” he said. “When reddish light shines on our bodies, it stimulates mechanisms including those that break down high levels of sugar in the blood or boost melatonin production. Since the introduction of fluorescent lighting and later LEDs, that part of the spectrum has been removed from artificial light and I think it is playing a part in the waves of obesity and rises in diabetes cases we see today.”UCL researchers are preparing to install additional infrared lamps in hospitals and intensive care units to see if they have an effect on the recovery of patients who would otherwise be starved of light from this part of the spectrum.“It’s going to take a huge effort to change the face of the planet and turn LEDs into more friendly lighting,” said Fosbury. It’s going to be a big job but we need to do it because it is having a very damaging effect on human health.”TopicsAstronomyThe ObserverPollutionFocusSpacenewsReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedEnvironmentClimate crisisWildlifeEnergyPollutionGreen lightNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The company will still accept auto insurance applicants.“State Farm General Insurance Company made this decision due to historic increases in construction costs outpacing inflation, rapidly growing catastrophe exposure, and a challenging reinsurance market,” the company said in a statement.“We take seriously our responsibility to manage risk. We recognize the governor’s administration, legislators and the California department of insurance (CDI) for their wildfire loss mitigation efforts. We pledge to work constructively with the CDI and policymakers to help build market capacity in California. However, it’s necessary to take these actions now to improve the company’s financial strength.”Existing customers insured by State Farm will not be impacted by the decision.In response to State Farm’s statement, a spokesperson with the California department of insurance told Fox Business News that it is working to protect homeowners.“The factors driving State Farm’s decision are beyond our control, including climate change, reinsurance costs affecting the entire insurance industry and global inflation,” said the spokesperson.State Farm is not the only insurance company to disrupt coverage over wildfires. American International Group, a multinational insurance company, notified thousands of California homeowners last year that their policies would not be renewed, the Wall Street Journal reported.The latest statement from State Farm comes after a bout of wildfires in California last year. While wildfires arenot rare in the western parts of the US, the climate crisis has exacerbated the issue, especially in California.California saw 7,490 wildfires in 2022, an increase from the previous year, according to data from the California government. One wildfire in northern California destroyed 100 homes and other buildings, reported NBC News.The severity of wildfires has destroyed homes, caused injuries and deaths, and worsened air quality, exposing millions to smoke and ash.California’s climates have become warmer and drier due to the climate crisis, causing the state’s wildfires to be more frequent and intense. A recent study found that between 1986 to 2021, almost 40% of forest area that burned in the western US and parts of Canada could be attributed to fossil fuels, the Washington Post reported.Moreover, California has experienced record wildfires in the past six years. The state experienced eight of the largest fires in US history and three of the top five deadliest fires.TopicsCaliforniaInsurance industryClimate crisisnewsReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedEnvironmentClimate crisisWildlifeEnergyPollutionGreen lightNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

That’s according to a new study, which found that between 25% and 70% of California beaches might be washed away by the end of the century, leaving only cliffs or coastal infrastructure in their wake.The study used satellite data collected over the past two decades to examine California’s 1,100-mile-long coast. Researchers from the US Geological Survey (USGS) used those satellite images, combined with models of climate crisis-driven sea level rise ranging from 1.6 to 10ft, to estimate the shape and position of the state’s coastline by 2100. The amount of sea level rise will depend on how much carbon is pumped into the atmosphere now and in the future.How solar farms took over the California desert: ‘An oasis has become a dead sea’Read moreThe paper, which is in the process of being peer-reviewed for publication, follows on from a 2017 study conducted by the same researchers focused on the rate of coastal erosion in southern California. That study found a similar fraction of southern California beaches – between 31 and 67% – were susceptible to vanishing.“Beaches are perhaps the most iconic feature of California, and the potential for losing this identity is real,” wrote Sean Vitousek, the researcher who led both the 2017 study and the current one. “Losing the protecting swath of beach sand between us and the pounding surf exposes critical infrastructure, businesses and homes to damage. Beaches are natural resources, and it is likely that human-management efforts must increase in order to preserve them.”The California Coastal Commission is already encouraging cities to harden their coastline by building seawalls or depositing large rocks that can help protect them from pounding waves (though sea walls can cause sand to erode faster from adjacent beaches). Restoring natural sand dunes can also help protect beaches. The study points to several areas at particular risk of severe erosion: Point Arena and Humboldt Bay in northern California, Pismo Beach and Morro Bay in central California, and Newport Beach and San Clemente in southern California.Losing beaches can have ripple effects on the communities that live inland. A study published in January showed that with 3ft of sea level rise, San Diego county would lose a quarter of picnic areas, half of its lifeguard towers, and 15% of restrooms at coastal access sites. That affects lower-income, historically marginalized populations the most – coastal dwellers tend to be whiter, older and wealthier than the average California resident. Without lifeguards, parking and other amenities, it becomes more difficult for people living far from the coast to enjoy the benefits of remaining beaches.Newport Beach in Orange county was among those deemed particularly at risk of severe coastal erosion. Photograph: Marcio José Sánchez/APThe new study is the first time that satellite-derived shorelines have been used for this type of analysis, says Mark Merrifield, a coastal oceanographer at Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, who was not involved in the research. But he warns that the predictions have a wide amount of uncertainty, so they should be taken with some skepticism, he says. “Beach morphology models in general have limited skill in predicting contemporary change, there are few datasets available for validation of the methodology, and projections of future wave and water level conditions introduce another level of uncertainty.”The beaches that have made California famous are already changing, with a 2009 USGS study finding that about 40% of beaches were already experiencing long-term erosion. Looking forward, the shape and size of the beaches is not yet clear, like a wave in the distant view. More research will be needed to bring the future into sharper relief. “It’s a complicated topic,” says Merrifield.Regardless, the study’s authors conclude that “substantial management efforts”, such as dune restoration, will be needed to maintain the beaches as they exist today. “It’s pretty sobering,” Vitousek recently told the San Francisco Chronicle. “This is a slow process when we’re talking about 2100, but it’s not that slow.”TopicsCaliforniaOceansClimate crisisnewsReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedEnvironmentClimate crisisWildlifeEnergyPollutionGreen lightNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Royce Kurmelovs@RoyceRk2Fri 26 May 2023 20.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 26 May 2023 20.55 EDTA government meet-and-greet to connect Australian industry with the world’s largest oil company, Saudi Aramco, has been criticised by environmental groups as “akin to a joint trade show with a tobacco major”.Australia’s international trade agency Austrade will host the event, “Doing business with Aramco 2023”, next Friday at the Duxton Hotel in Perth.The in-person event is pitched to companies in the oil and gas supply chain and petrochemical industries, and “will include bilateral business matching meetings, where Australian exporters will have the opportunity to showcase their capabilities to Aramco”.Saudi oil group Aramco to pay more to state despite profits dropRead more“The forum will provide a platform for Australian exporters to gain first-hand understanding of Aramco, its business opportunities, and the pathway to access those opportunities,” the event description says.Saudi Aramco is the world’s largest oil company, posting a $161bn profit in March – the largest ever profit recorded by an oil and gas firm.The company is 98.5% owned by the Saudi Arabian government and is also the most polluting oil company of all time – a recent analysis found that if oil companies were made to pay reparations for their contribution to climate change, Aramco would owe $43bn a year.Dorinda Cox, a Greens senator, said the event showed the federal government had the wrong priorities.“Net zero means moving rapidly away from coal, oil and gas, not seeking out future partnerships with another petrostate,” she said.“The Australian government should be spending money on the urgent housing crisis, not paying for the world’s richest oil company and biggest polluter to network and mingle.”Glenn Walker, head of advocacy and strategy at Greenpeace Australia Pacific, said Aramco’s contribution to increasing the risk posed by climate change made it inappropriate for the Australian government to host the event.“Fossil fuel companies like Aramco are knowingly fuelling dangerous global heating. This company should not be given a platform supported by the Australian government,” Walker said.“It is akin to a joint trade show with a tobacco major and should be roundly rejected by the minister for trade.”Austrade did not respond to questions about concerns about the event but said in a statement that the showcase will “provide Australian energy sector businesses with an opportunity to showcase their expertise and explore potential future business opportunities.”“Austrade is also committed to driving uptake of opportunities for exporters and investors linked to a net-zero emissions future,” the agency said.The International Energy Agency (IEA) has previously said limiting global heating to 1.5C as set out in the Paris agreement meant there can be no new oil, gas or coal investment beyond 2021. The IPCC has made similar statements.Reece Whitby, Western Australia’s minister for environment and climate action, visited Saudi Arabia last year to address a meeting of the International Energy Forum.During the visit he also met the Saudi minister of state for foreign affairs and envoy for climate, Adel bin Ahmed Al-Jubeir.#Riyadh | Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Member of the Council of Ministers, and Envoy for Climate H.E @AdelAljubeir receives Minister for Environment; and Climate Action, Hon Reece Whitby MLA. 🇸🇦🇦🇺 pic.twitter.com/FYo4yi3CKz— Foreign Ministry 🇸🇦 (@KSAmofaEN) November 6, 2022A spokesperson for WA’s environment department said neither the minister nor the department had any role in arranging the Austrade event.Sophie McNeill, a Human Rights Watch Australia researcher, said the organisation had “deep concerns” about the Saudi government’s track record on human rights “including executions, torture, the targeting and punishment of dissidents and critics, and the treatment of women.”TopicsAustralia newsSaudi ArabiaOilnewsReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Well, wonder no more, because here’s co-writer/director Robert Rodriguez with one he prepared earlier – splattering the cinema screen with all the colours of the daft, courtesy of an A-list star, a B-movie aesthetic, a C-minus musical score, and a D/E audience rating (Hypnotic has already failed to mesmerise in the US). Rejoice, fans of big-screen trash, as Oscar-winner Ben Affleck invites you to join him on a journey that will test your head, and your mind, and your brain…Affleck is in maximum frowny mode as Daniel Rourke, a detective haunted by memories of his young daughter’s abduction. The culprit pleaded “not guilty due to mental incapacity” after claiming to have no memory of the kidnapping, or of the child’s whereabouts. It sounds like a ruse, until Rourke finds himself playing cat-and-mouse with a criminal mastermind (William Fichtner) blessed with unholy powers of persuasion. “Are you familiar with the concept of hypnotic constructs?” asks Diana Cruz (Alice Braga), a “dime-store psychic” who delivers Basil Exposition-style speeches about “hypnotics” – people with “the ability to actually influence the brain over a psychic bandwidth. Telepaths just read the mind; hypnotics reshape its reality.”Much of this dialogue, including the immortal line “He erased his own mind?!”, is at once overripe yet still oddly soft-boiled. As for the mise-en-scène, the early movements are all baked exteriors and strip-club-lighting interiors, with heavily coded reds, blues and greens. Later, when the big reveal happens, everything goes white, signalling that a light has been shone on all these mysteries – although it all continues to make no sense.There’s fun to be had in scenes of a man attempting to pull his own hand off while under the influenceRodriguez and co-scripter Max Borenstein, who wrote the 2014 Godzilla reboot and created the Minority Report TV series, go on a thematic shoplifting spree, snatching psychic pushes from Stephen King’s Firestarter, dozy psycho-crime plot twists from Primal Fear, and Philip K Dick false memories from Blade Runner, Total Recall et al. At times I was reminded of the 2015 thriller Solace, in which Anthony Hopkins helped the FBI by functioning as a sort of psychic satnav. Somehow, this is even sillier.One minute Rodriguez is churning out sub-Inception world-bending hallucination scenes, the next he’s nodding his head toward Hitchcock as someone creeps towards a shower room brandishing a large pair of scissors (Herrmannesque strings ahoy!). Affleck does a lot of eyes-closed, big-face acting to indicate just how conflicted his character feels, while Braga does an impressive job of not laughing while delivering lines such as “Pain can keep the mind awake”, or “He was already dead; I set him free”.Sunglasses are worn indoors, scenery is chewed through sucked teeth (hats off to a scene-stealing Jackie Earle Haley for adding a fleeting note of uncharacteristic understatement) and a chase scene climaxes with a white van banging into a golf cart as everything implodes in a sub-Truman Show mess. Meanwhile composer Rebel Rodriguez leads the audience by the hand, with tinkly keyboard cues telling us when things are supposed to be sad, thumpy bash-bash noises pumping up the action scenes, and big quasi-Zimmer honks reminding us that his dad is essentially doing Christopher Nolan on the cheap.While the result may be preposterous tosh from start to finish (a nippy 94 minutes – hooray!), there’s fun to be had in scenes of a man attempting to pull his own hand off while under the influence, and in gunfights that turn into staring competitions and then end with everyone simply shooting themselves in the foot. Since Rodriguez’s back catalogue contains such knowing pulp as the vampire actioner From Dusk Till Dawn and the grindhouse pastiche Planet Terror, one presumes that he knows exactly how ridiculous this all is, and has his tongue planted firmly in his cheek throughout. Or maybe not. The fact that I’m not entirely sure simply adds to the guilty pleasure.Watch a trailer for Hypnotic.TopicsThrillersMark Kermode's film of the weekCrime filmsBen AffleckreviewsReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedFilmBooksMusicArt & designTV & radioStageClassicalGamesNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Photograph: Home Box OfficeThe ObserverSuccessionAbsurdity meets gravitas: how Nicholas Britell scored SuccessionAs the TV masterpiece bows out, the composer reveals the influences behind the writing of that indelible theme tuneEdward Helmore in New YorkSun 28 May 2023 05.00 EDTWhen the TV series Succession comes to an end on Sunday in the US – and on Monday in the UK – viewers will finally discover which, if any, of the squabbling Roy siblings will come out on top. But there is already one undisputed winner: the show’s composer, Nicholas Britell, whose score has been described as “the definitive TV theme of the 21st century”, changing the way TV productions use music to enhance or mirror plots.In a series of interviews last week, Britell, 42, lifted the lid on the show’s Emmy-winning score, telling New York public radio that it had succeeded “beyond my, any of our wildest dreams … it has been very special that the music has resonated the way it has”.In an interview on the Roger Ebert website, Britell, a Manhattan-based composer whose previous scores were for film, acknowledged that the music over the opening credits succeeded in getting viewers into “Succession mode”.“I’ve loved theme songs since I was very, very young,” Britell said. “There’s something about TV theme songs but also opening credit sequences – and I think about that in movies as well. I’m a big fan of formal cinematic structures.Composer Nicholas Britell. Photograph: Arturo Holmes/Getty Images“Especially with something like Succession, there’s almost this idea of an overture to an opera, let’s say, or a musical, where the music is going to bring you into this world and set the stage, no pun intended. It’s sort of saying “here we go”.The end sequence music was, Britell said, “there to sort of allow you a moment of contemplation, to ponder what you have just felt”.Britell said he was inspired to mix late-17th-century music style with hip-hop for the show’s theme after seeing Jeremy Strong (Kendall Roy) rapping to the Beastie Boys’ An Open Letter to NYC.A lengthy analysis in the New York Times detailed how Britell had written something unusual in television, turning a classic theme-and-variations work into a piece fit for a concert hall. The underlying eight-chord motif resurfaced in classical and baroque forms, with some that would blend in with chamber music.“My sort-of thesis there was that I would be very serious with the music, and inhabit this mixture of oversized beats and very late-18th-century classical music harmonies – everything would be a little too big for itself, a little out of proportion – the way the Roy family sees themselves,” he told Billboard after the second season.Britell had worked on Wall Street after graduating from Juilliard and Harvard where he’d had a hip-hop band and written music for his friend’s films. But the band broke up and the movie didn’t come out. Meanwhile, his experiences of working as a currency trader at Bear Stearns in 2008 as the bank failed “were really very unhappy”, he said.Each season of Succession required five to 10 new musical themes, in addition to variations on the main theme, and each required a different tempo – an allegro in season one, an adagio in two, season three was a lighter scherzo, and four “a sound where it could allow for the possibility of a future of some sort, while also staying true to, to me, that strange mixture of absurdity and gravitas that is the essence of the show”.Susan Jacobs, a New York music supervisor who places music in TV and film, said: “He came up with an operatic suite that you could almost see as an aria with these amazing complexities – something that could be very beautiful, sinister and driving at the same time.The Roys: from left, Keiron Culkin as Roman, Alan Ruck as Connor, Jeremy Strong as Kendall and Sarah Snook as Shiv. Photograph: Home Box Office“It’s like a beautiful tapestry that you can keep pulling at the threads of. It does everything it needs to do, a piece that he could carry forward through the entire show.”There’s very little about Succession that hasn’t been scrutinised in the lead up to the finale, whether that’s the fashion, “a four-season-long symphony of neutrals and fine materials”, according to Vanity Fair, or the use of language in the series, particularly insults. Long after Succession ends, it “will live on in our infinite brain boxes”, said the Wall Street Journal.‘I don’t let my wife use it’ – great TV theme tune composers savage ‘skip intro’Read moreBut it may be the music that lives on longest. Succession executive producer Adam McKay and writer Jesse Armstrong invited Britell to watch the filming of the pilot, and that helped him to “subconsciously kind of take things in about the frequency of the show”. What he came up with, he told PBS, was a mix of “dark, courtly classical sound” and “oversize hip-hop beats and 808s”, referring to the 1980s Roland TR-808 drum machine.The sound was designed to be imperfect and slightly off-key because “when things sound ‘right’ for the Roy family, it’s wrong … the family is so dysfunctional that the music has to have this kind of brokenness to it somehow.”That brokenness, however it is resolved or unresolved in the finale, will trail out with Britell’s score.TopicsSuccessionThe ObserverTelevisionHip-hopBeastie BoysfeaturesReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedFilmBooksMusicArt & designTV & radioStageClassicalGamesNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Photograph: Gary Calton/The ObserverThe ObserverPodcastsInterview‘We’re both romantic about what politics can be’: Alastair Campbell and Rory Stewart on their double actRachel CookeTo judge by the huge success of their podcast The Rest Is Politics, the UK still has an appetite for political ideas and debate. But how do the Labour stalwart and the Tory maverick really get on?@msrachelcookeSun 28 May 2023 02.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 28 May 2023 05.31 EDTThe Royal Hall in Harrogate has a long and interesting history. Designed by Robert Beale and the great Frank Matcham, it opened on the site of the former Cheltenham Pump Room in 1903 as the Kursaal – a name inspired by the building on which it was based, the Ostend Kursaal in Belgium (a German word, Kursaal means “Cure Hall”), and which it lost after the first world war, when something a little more patriotic was required. Whatever it was called, however, it always drew the crowds. Beneath its painted coffered ceiling – it is now Grade II* listed – Sarah Bernhardt starred in a special flying matinee of Alexandre Dumas’s La Dame aux Camelias. Edward Elgar came to conduct his own work here, and Arthur Conan Doyle to deliver a lecture. Louis Armstrong and the Beatles both played it.How times change, though. I realise that its glory days may be over. All the same, if you’d told me five years ago – or even two years ago – that tickets for the appearance in Harrogate of a double act comprising a former government spin doctor and a former government minister would sell out, and quickly, I wouldn’t have believed you. Who on earth, I might have asked, wants to spend their hard earned money on two hours of unfiltered chat on such subjects as a recent presidential election in Turkey, what might constitute inappropriate behaviour in the House of Commons, and whether the manager of Burnley FC would make a better prime minister than Keir Starmer? Aren’t we all a bit tired of listening to middle-aged men of a certain ilk drone on and on? Wouldn’t people rather just stay at home and watch Newsnight?But Harrogate, it turns out, isn’t the half of it. The double act in question – Alastair Campbell, Tony Blair’s bagpipe-playing former henchman, and Rory Stewart, who was briefly the secretary of state for international development under Theresa May – began their podcast, The Rest Is Politics, in March 2022. Since then, it has been downloaded 60m times, a figure that makes it one of the UK’s biggest. So far, they’ve taken it on the road on four previous occasions, having performed it live at the Leicester Square theatre in London, the Blackpool Winter Gardens, the London Palladium, and the Royal Albert Hall. Each venue soon sold out. At the Palladium, they shifted 4,500 tickets for two nights in six minutes (faster than the Foo Fighters, someone will tell me later). At the Albert Hall, 5,000 tickets went in a single morning. Harrogate, which seats just over 900 people, must seem like small fry in comparison, which may be one reason why backstage, Campbell, at least, seems both so disorganised and so blase (though I cannot entirely rule out the possibility that he is always like this).It is mid-afternoon now, and in his dressing room – if he has a rider, it obviously includes Jaffa Cakes, and I will shortly get told off for eating some of them – Campbell is steadying himself for the hours ahead. There is a lot to fit in. First, he and Stewart will record two podcasts: a regular episode, and one in which they answer questions from listeners (both go out every week). Then he will sign a huge pile of copies of his new book, But What Can I Do? (Why Politics Has Gone So Wrong, and How You Can Help to Fix It), for the punters. After this, the two will briefly rehearse tonight’s show on stage. A break for dinner will follow, and then, at last, it will be curtain up. “We’ve got some great clips for the audience tonight,” Campbell tells me, tearing open a bag of crisps. “Have you seen the film of Rory in the floods [in 2015, during his stint as environment minister] when he went to the wrong side of a bridge?” He emits a satisfied laugh. “He made a complete arse of himself. It’s pure The Thick of It.”Rory Stewart in his privy counsellor’s uniform on his way to attend the king’s coronation, accompanied by his wife, Shoshana Clark. Photograph: Twitter / Rory Stewart @RoryStewartUKWhat kind of people make up the audience at these live events? He gives me a look. “Fiona [Millar, his partner] and Grace [his daughter] thought it was completely mad at the Albert Hall,” he says. In what way mad? “The fans. They heard some of them asking each other what words they most like to hear us say, and stuff like that.” Since The Rest Is Politics (AKA TRIP) began, Campbell’s face has, he goes on, become an awful lot more recognisable. When he and Millar walk their dog in London, they’re constantly stopped by (mostly, it would seem) women. So will it be a bit like seeing Tom Jones in Las Vegas tonight? Should I expect underwear to be chucked at the stage? I’m teasing but, alas, Campbell seems not to notice. “It is a bit like that, actually,” he says, licking salt off his fingers.Every couple has an origin story, and I would like to hear his and Stewart’s. How did their bromance start? Were they friends before TRIP? Are they, come to that, friends now? “You know what?” he says. “It’s really weird. This is only the, what… sixth time we’ve been face to face in real life. Rory lives in Amman [in Jordan, where his wife, Shoshana, works as the CEO of the Turquoise Mountain Foundation, the NGO founded by Stewart, the then Prince of Wales, and Hamid Karzai], so we record online usually. We’re never in the same place, you see.”But no, they weren’t friends. The podcast is made by Goalhanger, a company co-founded by the ex-footballer and Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker. “I knew Tony [Pastor, also co-founder of Goalhanger, and the executive producer of TRIP] because he, like me, is a Burnley fan. I’ve known him for years. Anyway, they started this podcast, The Rest Is History [with Tom Holland and Dominic Sandbrook]. Big triumph. Tony came to see me in the Westminster Pret. He said: ‘This podcast thing is huge. It’s just two guys talking, but it is huge. So we should do one called The Rest Is Politics – you and a Tory.’ Their idea [for the Tory] was Dominic Cummings [Boris Johnson’s controversial former chief adviser]. Disaster. Not going to happen. So I went on social media and asked people: if I did a podcast with a Tory, who should it be? A good quarter said Rory. Other nominees were Ken Clarke, William Hague, Anna Soubry and Dominic Grieve, but he was way ahead.”What happened next? “I didn’t know Rory. The only time I’d ever had a proper conversation with him was in Steve Kinnock’s garden [Kinnock, the Labour MP for Aberavon, knows Stewart from Brussels, apparently]. But I phoned him. ‘That sounds interesting,’ he said. ‘The problem is, I live in Jordan.’ But Tony said it wasn’t a problem, and we started the next week.” What did he and Stewart want from it? Did they expect it to be a hit? “No. We both went into it not knowing if it would last. I think Rory saw it as a platform. He likes having a platform to display what he knows. But the thing I enjoy is talking about stuff you don’t normally talk about.” Today, they will be chatting, among other things, about the recent election in Thailand, where a social democratic party has triumphed, a story Campbell is determined the western media has ignored. Does he ever hesitate to discuss a subject on the grounds that he doesn’t know enough about it? “No, never,” he says.Campbell with Tony Blair in 2001, when he was Blair’s director of communications. Photograph: Ben Curtis/PA Archive/Press Association ImaCampbell and Stewart are quite different people, and they bring radically different kinds of knowledge and experience to the podcast. Campbell began his career as a reporter at the Mirror, leaving journalism to become Blair’s press secretary shortly before the 1997 election. From 2000-03, he was the Downing Street director of communications and strategy; he also worked for Labour in various guises during the election campaigns of 2005, 2010 and 2015. Yes, he has since written many books, including novels and a volume about mental health (he suffers from depression). But it is his political diaries that take up most space – several metres, at this point – on the nation’s bookshelves.He is, looked at one way, extremely parochial, obsessed with – passionate about, if you prefer – the Labour party to a degree that can be unnerving even to other devoted members (this, he tells me, easily survived his expulsion from the party in 2019 for voting Liberal Democrat in the European elections on the grounds of their support for a second Brexit referendum). Outside it, football is his principal other interest (though he makes time for park runs and cold water swimming). He’s also a bruiser: tribal, pugnacious, overly confident, and apt to lose his temper – as he did in the middle of a discussion about Brexit on the BBC’s Newsnight only the other evening.Somehow, everything is on the outside with Campbell, even as he looks ever inwards, a state of affairs that only makes Rory Stewart’s John Buchan-esque international-man-of-mystery persona seem the more exotic. Stewart is posh, highly controlled, stoical and to a degree unemotional, but his gaze is firmly outwards, his interest in the world intense and wide-ranging. An Old Etonian who once tutored Princes William and Harry, he was in the Black Watch before he went up to Oxford, and joined the Foreign Office after he came down. In 2000, he took a period of leave to walk across Asia, the Afghanistan leg of which he later described in his acclaimed book The Places in Between. After the 2003 invasion of Iraq, he ran two of the country’s provinces on behalf of the transitional government, overseeing elections and resolving tribal differences. In 2005, he set up the Turquoise Mountain Foundation in Kabul. All this – and a great deal more I haven’t room to describe here – before he was even returned as the Tory MP for Penrith and the Border in 2010. (In 2019, having held ministerial roles and stood for the Conservative party leadership, he lost the whip following a rebellion over a no-deal Brexit; soon afterwards, he announced he would be standing down as an MP at the next election.)Rory Stewart trekked across Afghanistan in 2001 for his book The Places in Between. Photograph: LA Times/Getty ImagesWhat unites them? For the first months of the podcast, they bonded over their intense dislike of Brexit and, especially, of Boris Johnson. But what about now? Is it, as I suspect, something quite old-fashioned that they share? Campbell nods. “I think we’ve both got quite a romantic view of what politics can be. When we started, we both loathed what Johnson stands for, and what he has done. I got the feeling that Rory was no longer a Tory he loathed him so much. But I’ve noticed that since Boris went, he’s gone back a bit. He might vote Lib Dem, but he’ll find it hard to go the whole way.”Earlier, Campbell told me that in a forthcoming podcast in which they interview Jonathan Powell, Blair’s former chief of staff, Stewart can be heard losing his temper over Iraq (he has come to believe the invasion was a catastrophic error). “I could see his body start to shake,” he said. So why isn’t the matter a problem between Campbell and Stewart? (Campbell was involved in the preparation of the Iraq dossier, the briefing document that was ultimately used to justify Britain’s participation in the war.) “Well, we did two hours on it on the podcast for the 20th anniversary. We did it in real depth, and he managed to keep his cool then. But he does still mention it, yes.”By the time MPs have been there for 10 years, they’re not fully rounded human beings any moreRory StewartCampbell likes Stewart’s clarity, the fact that (surprise) he doesn’t interrupt, and, I surmise (because he doesn’t precisely articulate this), his kindness, which manifests itself in the form of gentle, diligent good manners. “I’ve only ever done the podcast once when I was clinically depressed,” says Campbell. “I felt so bad, I said so, and we ended up doing half of it about mental health and politics. He’s very good like that. He’s not naturally empathetic in a way I can be – Rory can be quite reserved – but he’s emotionally intelligent when it comes to stuff like that. I sometimes go a bit far in needling him, but most of the time, he’s fine with it. I mean, we both have irritating mannerisms. Sometimes, he won’t engage. He’s got this habit where he says, ‘Hmm, very good’ [he makes his voice clipped and patrician], and then he moves on.” Later, I will hear Stewart do exactly this, and each time he does, it is a bit like being in a John le Carré novel. The shrewd diplomat, faced with a potential tyrant, knows precisely how to handle him, his artful segue carefully and disarmingly cast as praise.They record their podcasts in Stewart’s dressing room, surrounded by posters advertising the performances of their predecessors: Elaine Paige, Chris Bonnington, Stu Francis (who used to present Crackerjack). It’s in the basement, and its walls are painted green; the feeling is of being in a changing room at a municipal swimming pool. They talk, first, about Starmer’s latest speech. Neither of them was wholly convinced by it; more policies are needed. Then they discuss the National Conservatism Conference, an event attended by Tory rightwingers (“horrifying”, says Stewart). From here they move on to Thailand, Stewart dazzling everyone with his knowledge of the antics of King Vajiralongkorn and his dog, Air Chief Marshal Fufu, and finally to Syria, which has recently returned to the Arab League. They sound just as they do on air; the show is barely cut or tweaked at all. What strikes me most, however, is how often they tend to agree. Here, in human form, is that elusive, half-forgotten thing: the centre ground.Ten things we learned from the UK NatCon conferenceRead moreAfter this, everyone begins dashing about. When do they I eat, I think, beginning to feel faint. When do they sleep? Stewart has flown in from Amman this morning – tomorrow, he’ll leave for Japan – and for all that his back is the straightest I’ve ever seen, there’s something frail about him: I sense him battling weariness. When we finally sit down to speak – we snatch 10 minutes together in a corridor where Royal Hall stewards are being briefed about their evening’s duties – I have a strong urge to ask for a blanket, to wrap it around his knees. But once we’re talking, he rallies, of course. He’s funny and charming. “He wasn’t my type at all,” he says, with mock coyness, of his latest bedfellow. “It wasn’t supposed to be serious.”The Rest Is Politics isn’t some kind of substitute, he tells me. He really doesn’t miss Westminster. “I hated it, yes. I feel it [politics] is incredibly important. I wish I were tough enough and had enough energy to somehow find a way back into it, and to be able to do it in a way I could survive. But I basically felt it was unbearable. There were colleagues who loved it – George Osborne loved the game of it – but I just felt continual disappointment.” Something happens to those who are elected, he says. “It’s not necessarily to do with the kind of people who become MPs. It may just be a consequence of the structure of parliament and what it does to them. But by the time they’ve been there 10 years, they’re not fully rounded human beings any more. They are so short-tactical. The idea that people are serious about policy! The thinking in both parties is incredibly narrow-minded. It’s very, very bad for you.” The podcast’s principal allure for him, then, is that it is without limits: “It’s an opportunity for me to talk boringly about things like GDP per capita, and I love that.”But there are other things, too. For instance, as previously discussed, Boris. “Yes! His loss was a real threat to the podcast. We had an amazing nine months of being fantastically rude about Boris. Then Liz Truss came along. There was a moment after she left when I thought: who’s going to listen to this any more? Our audience is here to be angry about Boris and Truss, and Rishi Sunak is just not as awful.” What about Campbell? Has he come to like him? (I know: it’s as if I’m Derek Batey, and this is Mr and Mrs.) He grins. “The accusation my friends make is that he’s grooming me to join Labour.” This, he says, will never happen.Doesn’t he find Campbell’s tribalism annoying, though? Again, he smiles. “I do like him. I’ve become very fond of him. I sort of trust him. I think he’s reliable. He’s very cheeky and naughty and gossipy, if you don’t put him under a D-notice. But if you say, ‘Don’t repeat this’, he’s trustworthy and loyal.” So they’ll keep at it? For how long? “That’s a good question. I don’t know. But I do enjoy it.”Onstage at the Royal Hall, Harrogate, Alastair Campbell and Rory Stewart view a clip from Newsnight when Campbell lost his temper with Alex Phillips, the former Brexit party MEP. Photograph: Gary Calton/The ObserverAt this point, someone arrives to whisk him away. Showtime approaches, and I duly take my seat in the Royal Hall. I look around. The audience is so mixed: here are entire families, politics A-level students in tow, and here are also thirtysomething couples, in corduroy and trainers. I do see a few groups of women, drinks in hand, but they are, perhaps, less excitable than billed. When the curtain rises – Campbell sits beneath a red spotlight, and Stewart beneath a blue – they begin by asking the crowd where they’ve travelled from. A show of hands reveals that more than half the audience is from outside Harrogate. One couple has come from south Wales, and another group from the Channel Islands.What follows is, in essence, a reprise of what I heard earlier, with the addition of a few knobs and whistles. The audience claps and cheers when Stewart describes how he once refused to be bullied by George Osborne, and laughs uproariously at footage of him determinedly explaining that, no, a flood defence had not been breached; the water had simply come over it. Campbell talks everyone through his Burnley ties, which are, after all, a great deal more sensible than the Privy Counsellor’s uniform Stewart wore to the coronation; there is also some peculiar sporran talk (both men own more than one). Campbell then plays, by way of a finale, a lament he has composed for the lost of Northern Ireland on his bagpipes, a tune he transmogrifies into Happy Birthday in honour of someone in the balcony.And then it’s over at last, and we all trail out into the cool of the night. Does the crowd seem happy? Did The Rest Is Politics Live meet their expectations? My analysis is that yes, they do, and yes, it did. “Oh, it was very enjoyable, wasn’t it?” I hear a woman say to her friend, in a voice I would describe, as a Yorkshire person myself, as exuding a full sense of value for money. And I find that I feel quite happy, too, for all that I’ve had no supper. People are said to be sick and tired of politics. We’re told they’re disengaged and dangerously cynical. But perhaps the success of Campbell and Stewart’s podcast tells a different story. It is politicians and their behaviour that appal us. The dissemination of important, interesting information is another matter altogether. Ideas: some of us crave those still.TopicsPodcastsThe ObserverPodcastingAlastair CampbellRory StewartBrexitInternetDigital mediafeaturesReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedFilmBooksMusicArt & designTV & radioStageClassicalGamesNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

One of these…Of the 131 RIBA regional award winners just announced, this year’s Stirling prize contenders ought to include a precision-tooled Isle of Wight house, the LSE’s latest addition and a farm in the middle of BelfastRowan MooreSun 28 May 2023 04.00 EDTHow do you measure a classical church in the north-east of England, chastely converted into a community centre, against a louche re-creation in a London theatre of a Weimar republic nightclub? Or a shed for a city farm in Northern Ireland against a sumptuous bespoke guest house on a private estate? You can’t exactly. The comparison is not so much apples and oranges as blackcurrants and kumquats, souffles and chips, fish and bicycles. But to choose one from many incomparables is the challenge that faces the judges of the Stirling prize, the award given annually by the Royal Institute of British Architects to the best new building in Britain.The 131 winners of this year’s RIBA regional awards have been announced over the past couple of weeks, from which national award winners will be chosen, from whom will come in July the shortlist for the Stirling, with the winner to be selected in October. The list offers a panorama of the current state of the more creative end of British architecture: an eclectic collection dominated by no one style or ideology, that offers varying degrees of skill, splendour and social worth. If architecture is a matter of commodity, firmness and delight, the question is how many points should be awarded in each category.If delight is the main consideration, it’s hard to look past Saltmarsh House, a pavilion designed by last year’s Stirling winner, Níall McLaughlin, in the grounds of a Victorian faux castle on the Isle of Wight, built to do little more than contain a 12-seat dinner table, a guest bedroom, kitchen and bathroom. It’s a structure of extraordinary lightness, where a network of slender, gold-painted tubes supports a roof of shallow pyramids, copper-clad on top and ash-lined on their underside. A long wall of motorised windows can descend out of sight towards the ground, opening up the interior to the scents, sounds and views of neighbouring marshes and the sea. Timber screens are lined with hand-painted silk.Níall McLaughlin’s Saltmarsh House on the Isle of Wight: ‘mathematically insistent and precise to the point of luxuriance’. Photograph: Nick KaneIt’s mathematically insistent and precise – the diameter of the metal tubes used for both structure and light fittings is an unvarying 4cm, and it’s built to a tiny 3mm margin of error – to the point of luxuriance. Victorian greenhouses that once stood nearby are inspirations for its fragility, the Amber Fort in Jaipur for its quadripartite columns, the Japanese engawa or veranda for the open-to-nature dining room.Saltmarsh House is beautiful but private. The Stirling prize, as it should, usually goes to projects with a clear public benefit: such as 17Nineteen, for example, where the 300-year-old Holy Trinity church in Sunderland, which historically served civic as well as religious purposes, has been made by the Newcastle architects Mosedale Gillatt into a place of folk music concerts, workshops in creative writing and historical dance, open mic nights and suchlike. It’s a calm and spare restoration that allows the old building, a light-filled volume with high Corinthian columns and big arched windows, to breathe.Lincoln Cathedral’s ‘venerable-but-friendly style’ new visitor centre. Photograph: Giles RochollThe new architecture here, though, might be too reticent for the judges, in which case they could consider Lincoln Cathedral visitor centre, by the Edinburgh practice Simpson & Brown. This is a new building and a Victorian deanery converted to public use, formed around a cloister-like court, designed in the modernist-medieval, venerable-but-friendly style that the Church of England likes to deploy in the presence of its most treasured monuments, all sturdy stone piers on the exterior and emphatic timber beams within.Or they might go for Morden College, a home for older people in Blackheath, south-east London, founded in 1695, to which the architects Mae (whose Sands End arts centre was shortlisted for last year’s Stirling) have added a brick-and-timber day care centre. It’s an intimate and informal composition, distinctly Scandinavian in spirit, lifted by moments of amplitude – a high, luminous dining space; a broad passageway winding through it; generous connections to the outside. It’s casual, you might say, except that the carefulness of the architecture is anything but.‘Oomph’: York St John Creative Centre. Hufton+CrowThe John Morden Centre, as Mae’s project is called, is an exemplary work of the sober, thoughtful approach that, ever since “iconic” architecture went out of favour in Britain, has tended to do well in the Stirling prize. This remains a welcome development, but it can make one yearn for a richer diet, for a bit more oomph and joy. The Creative Centre for the music and computer science courses of York St John University, by Tate + Co of London, provides some of such qualities, if a touch clumsily, with a big black projecting cube and an also-black semi-cylinder containing its auditorium, enlivened with concave and convex timber cladding. It’s also environmentally credible, with wood-based construction and simple, low-energy methods of heating and ventilation.East Quay Arts Centre in Watchet, Somerset: ‘a metaphorical pile-up of things seasidey’. Photograph: Jim Stephenson/ Ellis Williams ArchitectsAnother in the more-adventurous category is the East Quay Arts Centre in Watchet, Somerset, a metaphorical pile-up of things seasidey, from a cliff-like plinth to superstructures striped like beach huts, designed by Invisible Studio for the local social enterprise Onion Collective. Reminiscent of some of the California work that Frank Gehry did before he got really famous, with intimate courts and terraces formed between its stacked-up shapes, it houses galleries, workshops and studios, a restaurant and “accommodation pods for adventurous travellers”. If sheer spectacle is your thing, there’s the transformation of the Playhouse Theatre in London by the architects Carmody Groarke and the theatre consultants Charcoalblue into an immersive, in-the-round version of the Kit Kat club that is the setting for Cabaret – all fringes and tassels in eye-shadow greens and purples, with saucy drawings on the walls in the manner of George Grosz.But the prize, for me, should come down to two very different buildings. One is the Marshall Building for the London School of Economics, by the Dublin-based Grafton Architects: heroic, punchy and wondrously complex and wrought. No one could accuse its big, tree-like columns or sweeping spiral stair or its intersecting multistorey volumes of being too sober and retiring, but it is also considered, composed and grounded in its place and use. The only, if large, point against it is that it uses a lot of the environmentally dubious material of concrete.‘Wondrously complex’: Grafton Architects’ Marshall Building for the LSE in Lincoln’s Inn Fields, London. Photograph: Nick KaneThe other is St James’s farm at Bog Meadows, a community resource amid the tower blocks of west Belfast, by the 10-year-old practice MMAS. It shows what might be done when you don’t have the sponsorship (as the Marshall Building does) of hedge fund wealth. Working to a minuscule budget of £212,000, the architects have designed a simple long shed, using the basic, standardised components of agricultural buildings everywhere, sited to protect a courtyard garden from road noise and fumes. It gains presence and scale from the thought with which its elements are put together – as considered in their way, if less well-resourced, than those on McLaughlin’s pavilion – and such touches as the judicious use of red paint and a run of V-shaped struts that hold up its projecting roof.St James’s community farm, Belfast, built on a ‘minuscule budget’. MMAS ArchitectsThe Stirling’s judges, if the Belfast farm makes the shortlist, may think it insufficiently substantial for their weighty prize. They may also be deterred from choosing the Marshall Building on the grounds that Grafton won the prize two years ago with their Town House for Kingston University, although in previous years their predecessors were happy to honour Norman Foster, Richard Rogers and Zaha Hadid more than once. They may also be deterred by the current mistrust of concrete. It would be shame, if so, for this is architecture with a pulse.TopicsStirling prizeThe ObserverArchitectureAwards and prizesfeaturesReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedFilmBooksMusicArt & designTV & radioStageClassicalGamesNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Photograph: José Luis Magaña/APObserver book of the weekHistory booksReviewEnd Times by Peter Turchin review – can we predict the collapse of societies?By examining history through complex mathematics, the ‘collapsologist’ aims to show – somewhat persuasively – that there are cyclical trends in the narratives of human hope and failureTim Adams@TimAdamsWritesSun 28 May 2023 02.00 EDTFor as long as complex human societies have existed there have been people predicting their imminent collapse. In recent years, the apocalypse business has become far more scientific; animal entrails and planetary portents have given way to big data. Peter Turchin is a pre-eminent digital-age seer or, as he suggests, a collapsologist. He trained in biology, using statistical models to examine networks of relationships between predators and prey. In the 1990s, however, after witnessing first-hand the sudden unravelling of the Soviet Union, from which his father had been a dissident exile, he turned his analytical brain to a different set of questions. Turchin set out to discover statistical patterns in the great flood of historical data that might predict future instabilities in societies. Like all Cassandras worth their infamy, he came to his vocation at a fortunate time.Turchin calls his method “cliodynamics”. In a series of books – War and Peace and War (2006) and The Ages of Discord (2016) – he has used his datasets to try to establish the basis on which all human civilisations in the era of cities and states have the mechanisms of their own destruction built-in. He not only endeavours to show that complex mathematics might unlock those derailing forces, but also how it might help to avert them.In response, many historians, wedded to the idea that their discipline is an art rather than a science, have tended to disparage the notion that their life’s work might be better understood through a series of complex equations: there are, they argue, simply too many variables to explain crises, revolutions, wars, even everyday political shifts in society. This book is Turchin’s latest, somewhat persuasive, attempt to challenge that consensus.The forces of capital seek to destroy the voices of ideology and things fall apartPart of its authority lies in the fact that his datasets are growing enormously. In 2011 Turchin, a professor at the University of Connecticut and leader of the Complexity Science Hub in Vienna, established a project called Seshat (named after the Egyptian goddess of archives). Seshat involves scores of expert collaborators – anthropologists, archaeologists, historians – in building the world’s largest collection of data on the prosperity and demise of societies from upper Egypt to lower Manhattan. While acknowledging that all findings are inevitably a work in progress, Turchin extrapolates certain cyclical trends in this great collected narrative of human hope and human failure.The most common pattern he presents is “an alternation of integrative and disintegrative phases lasting for roughly a century”. His predictions have a special urgency because western societies, and particularly America, are, he suggests, very near the end of that latter disintegrative phase, which makes the likelihood of civil war or potential systemic collapse far more likely. His model attempts to weight certain factors to predict this social meltdown. Key among them are rapidly growing inequality of wealth and wages, an overproduction of potential elites – children of wealthy dynasties, graduates with advanced degrees, frustrated social commentators – and an uncontrolled growth in public debt. In the US, he suggests – and by association the UK – these “factors started to take an ominous turn in the 1970s… The data pointed to the years around 2020 when the confluence of these trends was expected to trigger a spike in political instability. And here we are.”Locals destroy the Berlin Wall in November 1989. Photograph: John Gaps III/APThough the methodology to arrive at such conclusions may be complex – and derive from examination of the late medieval crisis in France and the Taipeng rebellion in China and the American civil war and all points in between – the destabilising forces that Turchin describes often seem to be in plain sight. You might intuit most of them from reading this morning’s newspaper. The driving forces of negative trends in all societies are broadly twin-engined, he argues. One is the presence of a perverse “wealth pump” which, after years of more equitable wealth distribution, takes from the poor and gives to the rich. In 1983 there were 66,000 households worth at least $10m in the US. By 2019, that number had increased in terms adjusted for inflation to 693,000. But while those numbers of the super-rich increased so the income and wealth of the typical American declined.This trend has coincided with the second major destabilising factor, what Turchin defines as the “overproduction of elites”, in which an ever greater number of people compete over a finite and increasingly corrupt structure of privilege and power. He offers four factions between which this competition for status is perennially played out: militaristic, financial, bureaucratic and ideological. As societies decline the balanced equation of these factions falls wildly out of balance. The forces of capital seek to destroy the voices of ideology – one “elite” arms itself against another in a series of real wars or culture wars – and things fall apart. The strength of applying these metrics in an “objective” way across a multitude of historical situations, Turchin argues, is that general principles emerge. “The goal of cliodynamics,” he argues, “is to integrate all important forces of history, whether they are demographic, economic, social, cultural or ideological.” If that ambition sounds a little reminiscent of Mr Casaubon and the doomed “Key to All Mythologies” then you might – or might not – take comfort in the fact that Turchin has outsourced his hubris, and his doubts, to the invisible hand of data analysis.Not surprisingly, Turchin’s methods have some keen advocates among the new plutocracy of Silicon Valley – billionaires with an interest not only in complex mathematics, but in how to maintain all the zeroes attached to their outrageous fortune (“They get it,” Turchin has said. “But then they have two questions. How can they make money out of the situation? And when should they buy their plot in New Zealand?”).If he trades in apocalypse, however, his hope is to identify the means by which some societies faced with these existential threats have managed to mitigate or dodge them. He examines the ways Britain escaped revolution with the 1832 Reform Act, and how the extreme indicators after the Great Depression led to “a prosocial faction” within America’s ruling elite, giving away a large proportion of its wealth in taxes to prevent catastrophe. (When the federal tax rate was introduced in 1913, the top rate was 7%. For two decades after the second world war, it remained above 90%.) “Complex human societies need elites – rulers, administrators, thought leaders – to function well,” Turchin writes. “We don’t want to get rid of them; the trick is to constrain them to act for the benefit of all.” Sadly, however, that particular algorithm is still under construction.

Photograph: Roger Deakin archive UEAThe ObserverAutobiography and memoirReviewThe Swimmer: The Wild Life of Roger Deakin by Patrick Barkham review – straight in at the deep endBarkham conjures the life of the wild swimming champion and author of Waterlog in a bravura act of creative memoirAlex PrestonSun 28 May 2023 06.00 EDTNot long after my first novel was published, I was invited to a writers’ symposium at UEA in Norwich. The campus is just outside the town and overlooks a lake they call the Broad, where I spent much of my time. I swam under the spell of two books: Charles Sprawson’s Haunts of the Black Masseur and Roger Deakin’s Waterlog, each of which made swimming feel like an expression of the liberated self, a declaration of existential intent. During those strange days in Norfolk, I also stumbled into the university library, where I found, to my delight, the Roger Deakin archive: a vast collection of notebooks, letters and journals left by the writer on his death in 2006.A good literary biography is often a kind of joint venture between writer and subject. You think of Nicholas Shakespeare’s life of Bruce Chatwin, or Jonathan Coe on BS Johnson. In The Swimmer, Patrick Barkham – a fine author in his own right – takes this idea to its logical conclusion, mining and shaping that enormous, eccentric archive into a book that is, as far as we can make out, about four-fifths in Deakin’s own hand but reads like a first-person memoir. Deakin’s own observations are augmented by Barkham, who did extensive interviews with the writer’s friends, family and former lovers. There are also, fascinatingly, passages written by Barkham in Deakin’s own voice. In the introduction, he parses a brief section – Deakin’s visit to a Royal Navy ship in Venice – and tells us which paragraphs were Deakin and which Barkham. But for the rest, we have to guess.Deakin records his life as if he knows that a book like this will one day be written about itThat you don’t really see the joins in the enterprise is credit to Barkham’s skill as a writer, but also as an organiser of content. The story here is largely chronological, but the way it is told, the movement between the jagged present tense of the journals, the more meditative reflectiveness of the notebooks written late in life and the wistful reminiscences of friends lends the whole endeavour a sense of multidimensional dynamism.Deakin only published a single book in his lifetime: Waterlog was hugely successful and one of the foundational texts for the whole wild swimming movement. His more ambitious work, Wildwood, a meditation on the relationship between humans and trees, came out after his death, as did Notes from Walnut Tree Farm, which was, like The Swimmer, mined posthumously from his journals. There are two things, though, that strike you early on as you read The Swimmer: first, that Deakin was more about the life than the art – his career, writes Barkham, riffles like a wild river”, moving lustily from lover to lover, from job to job, propelled by an overpoweringly romantic vision of himself; second, that this is as much a biography of a generation as an individual.Roger Deakin rememberedRead moreI confess to feeling something like jealousy reading the record of Deakin’s wonderful, friend-filled existence, at once liberated and rooted. A boomer, he grew up in a postwar era of optimism and economic prosperity, a working-class scholarship boy at Haberdashers’ Aske’s (“we knew how to use the apostrophe”) who went on to a dreamlike Cambridge of punting and Pimm’s. He became a successful advertising executive, was pursued by any number of girls, then found a ruined farmhouse in Suffolk to which, aged 31, he retired. He then teaches, swims, gets involved in the local “faires”, which are like mini East Anglian Glastonburys, befriends Richard Branson and Andrea Arnold, Richard Mabey and Robert Macfarlane. He’s a terrible poet but a beautiful writer of prose, and records his life as if he knows that a book like this will one day be written about it.With freedom, as for so many in his generation, comes selfishness and callousness. Turning 20 in 1963, the year Larkin said that sex began, Deakin leaves a trail of broken hearts behind him. He almost misses the birth of his son (he was checking on his donkeys), begins an affair soon after, and then is downcast when his wife scoops the child up after a final, violent argument and departs. Other women come and go; friends are the constant. He dies (of cancer) too young, too swiftly, at 63, leaving behind two great books: one is Waterlog, the other is The Swimmer – a rich, strange and compelling work of creative memoir that beautifully honours and elevates the life and work of its subject.Alex Preston is the author of Winchelsea (Canongate, £9.99)

Photograph: Getty ImagesThe ObserverAllergiesCats, peanuts, bee stings… the irritating truth about allergiesMore and more of us suffer from allergies, and medicine is struggling to keep up. Rebecca Seal talks to medical anthropologist Theresa MacPhailRebecca Seal@RebeccaSealSun 28 May 2023 03.00 EDTWhen Theresa MacPhail was four, her brother was killed in an accident. When she was 14, her mother died in a car crash. And when she was 24, her father died from anaphylactic shock after a bee flew in through the open window of his truck and stung him in the neck. For anyone else, these devastating experiences would almost certainly have been psychologically catastrophic. “I have several friends who are psychology professors, and they’re always saying, ‘No offence but, by rights, you should be a drug addict, or have severe emotional issues,’” she says, smiling, over Zoom from her home in New York, wearing a cheerful sweatshirt covered in luminous kittens. Photograph: Stefan Sollfors/AlamyInstead, MacPhail decided to use what she’d been through as the bedrock for her PhD at UC Berkeley, and then her career as a medical anthropologist. She laughs. “I’m like the doyenne of death. I have been thinking my whole life about the things that make people ill and pass away, because of my history. These are the waters I’ve been in since I was a kid. Rather than ignoring it, I decided to go at all my fears and insecurities about mortality. And then I basically made it my profession.”Much of MacPhail’s anthropological research has been into our collective fear of viruses, but six years ago and in her late 40s, repeated chest infections led to her unexpectedly being diagnosed with respiratory allergies. “When you’re 24, you think you’re invincible, so the only time I thought about whether I had the same allergy as my dad was when a bee came near me. But after I was diagnosed, I told all my friends about trying to figure out what I’m allergic to, and it turns out everyone has an allergy story. And then I thought, ‘Wait, just how prevalent are allergies?’ I had questions about whether this is just happening to us now, or was it the same in the past? I found academic articles but nothing accessible. I was complaining to a friend who is also a medical anthropologist. And that conversation is now famous in my mind, because he said to me, ‘Hey, aren’t you a researcher?’”The result is a brilliantly comprehensive and highly readable book, Allergic: How Our Immune System Reacts to a Changing World, five years in the making and the first ever to track both the history of allergies and the state of modern allergy science, while also trying to get to the bottom of how, almost 30 years ago, her father came to be unknowingly and fatally allergic to bee venom, and whether she might be, too. If that sounds outrageously complicated, it was. “Every allergist I interviewed told me it couldn’t be done. They were all like, ‘What are you trying to do? And I said, ‘I’m trying to do the whole story.’ And they said, ‘All allergies?’ And I said, ‘Yeah’, and they said, ‘Good luck.’”Hard to crack: peanut allergy now runs at 1 in every 70 kids, versus 1 in 250 in 1997. Photograph: Craig Cutler/Trunk  ArchiveIt’s startling that this is the first popular science book of its sort. “Culturally, people have self-trained that allergies are not a big deal. But allergies are a signal that your immune system isn’t happy with the world you live in. And I think that’s a conversation we should all be having.”Despite interviewing practically every top allergist and allergy researcher in the world and being comprehensively tested, it is very unlikely MacPhail will ever know exactly what she is allergic to, unless she is unlucky enough to have an extreme and therefore very obvious reaction. Her experience mirrors that of many allergy sufferers. My six-year-old daughter has a respiratory allergy and, even after testing, we have no idea why. Because it’s mild and far from life-threatening, we haven’t been able to get a referral to an NHS allergy specialist, even though it makes life miserable. She also had cow’s milk and soy protein allergies as a baby, making her one of the 48% of allergic people who have more than one allergy.“The only way to know for sure if you have an allergy is to see someone who specialises in it,” says MacPhail. “But I don’t want to be glib about that, because lots of people just can’t: there aren’t that many allergists and it’s not a popular speciality. And if your allergies don’t qualify, you’ll be paying out of pocket.” Other factors affect access to services, too. “For instance, with skin allergy, for years they only trained people on white skin, so eczema can be under-diagnosed on brown skin,” says MacPhail. In the UK, getting a referral or a prescription can depend on the amount of training your particular GP has voluntarily undertaken – allergies were only made a compulsory part of the GP curriculum in 2019, meaning many GPs may have no allergy training at all, despite allergies being the subject of 8% of all GP appointments. There are only 40 adult allergy consultants, and even fewer paediatric specialists working in the NHS, according to the charity Allergy UK, which is currently calling for specialist allergy nurses to be placed in all GP practices, following a trial in which 95% of allergy patients were successfully treated in their doctor’s surgery.‘I’m like the doyenne of death. I’ve been thinking my whole life about the things that make people ill and pass away, because of my history’: Theresa MacPhail. Photograph: Benedict Evans/The ObserverAnecdotal evidence has long suggested that our allergy problem is getting worse, but until recently it’s been hard to be sure. We are better at diagnosing allergies than we were two centuries ago, say, and the theory has always been that back then, people were more worried about tuberculosis or any of the myriad other things which could kill you or your children in the pre-antibiotic and antiseptic age. A runny nose, itchy rash or upset stomach would barely register, meaning that while fatal reactions to bites and stings certainly happened, if respiratory, dermatological or food allergies did exist, no one took much notice. (On the other hand, diarists like Pepys recorded every niggle, so if chronic allergies had been common before the Industrial Revolution, debilitated sufferers would surely have left clues behind?)MacPhail, however, has gathered a raft of data which conclusively shows that yes, we are becoming more allergic. There’s the study by the Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network showing that peanut allergy now runs at 1 in every 70 kids, versus 1 in 250 in 1997. In the US, on average, someone now arrives in A&E every two hours with a severe allergic reaction. A study by Imperial College London suggests food allergy anaphylaxis increased by 5.7% between 1998 and 2018. US hospital admissions for asthma tripled between 1970 and 1990, and asthma rates continue to climb in developing countries.I asked every expert, what is the cause? They simply said everything, it’s everything we’re doingIt’s trickier to measure either national or global rates of less catastrophic allergies, such as hay fever, which was first observed in the 1800s, or allergies which cause localised reactions, in part because so many people self-diagnose – sometimes accurately, sometimes not – and because GPs don’t always recognise or record allergies. MacPhail’s conservative estimate, after wading through global datasets of highly variable quality, is that 10% of the world’s population – 800 million people – will have a respiratory allergy at some point in their lives. But she says it’s impossible to know exactly how many people have other allergies, because there is so much variation in how a person is diagnosed, if at all. Allergy UK says one in three Britons will experience an allergy during their lifetime and that currently 50% of British children have an allergy. Research by the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology suggests that up to half of Europeans may be affected by allergy by 2025. We may not have precise numbers, but it’s clear that allergies are a big problem, getting bigger.Another problem with the data – which often relies on self-reporting – is the public’s misunderstanding of the difference between intolerances and allergies. “Most of us do not understand what the results of a scratch test show,” says MacPhail, of the tests done by breaking the skin and applying a tiny amount of possible allergens, then waiting to see if a skin reaction occurs. “They’re just telling you if you have a sensitivity. The difference between sensitivity, intolerance and allergy is the number one thing all allergists wish we could understand.”Straw poll: 48% of allergic people have more than one allergy. Photograph: Rob Shaw/ShutterstockCan she help us? “This is why it’s so important to get access to better care, because it’s almost impossible to know without seeing an allergist. The best example is lactose intolerance versus milk allergy. They can seem similar, but the difference is that when you have an intolerance, you don’t produce the enzyme that breaks down the milk protein, which gives you an upset stomach and really does not feel good. It also does not feel good if you have a milk allergy and you ingest milk, but the difference is that you are activating mast cells, basophils, T-cells and IgE antibodies and your whole system is going into effect. But it’s really difficult at a symptom level – unless you go into anaphylaxis – to know which is an intolerance and which is allergy.”When it comes to scratch tests, it’s even more confusing. “If someone thinks they have a milk allergy and they react every time they drink milk, but they have a blood test showing normal antibody levels and their skin test is negative, then the likelihood of allergy is slim to none. On the other hand, your scratch test could leave you with a huge welt on your arm, but you’ve never had a reaction to milk in real life.” Without an allergist to do your case history and family history and combine your various blood and skin results, the welt just means you have a sensitivity – which might never result in symptoms, and doesn’t necessarily mean you need to change your behaviour.It’s also easier to get taken seriously when you call your symptoms an allergy. “I want to stress that intolerances are terrible and I understand why it’s confusing. On Reddit, there’s a subreddit for allergies, and people post pictures of the welts on their arms or backs after a scratch test, saying, ‘Look at all these things I’m allergic to.’“These poor people are then going to be avoiding all these things, when they don’t have to. And here’s the rub: if you avoid something, you can actually accidentally trigger an allergy because you are denying your immune system the training it needs to tolerate it. You think you’re allergic to milk, you don’t drink milk, and your body forgets what milk protein looks like. The next time you ingest it, you might have given yourself an allergic response.”Blowing in the wind: climate change is causing higher levels of pollen. Photograph: Levi Brown/Trunk  ArchiveSo why are we getting more allergic? “No one knows what the smoking gun is. It’s multifactorial. That’s quite overwhelming and to think about what the solution would be is overwhelming, too. I asked every expert: ‘What is the cause?’ All of them refused to answer and simply said ‘Everything’. It’s everything we’re doing.”There are many things which MacPhail’s exhaustive research shows are part of the allergenic picture. The mass movement of people to cities during industrialisation, cutting our access to daylight, animals, dirt and native plants (the UK industrialised first and fastest, which may explain why we are in the global top three countries for allergies). More of us live in housing which is warmer, damper, mouldier and fuller of upholstery-loving dust mites. Children playing outdoors less in the first three years of life. Vitamin D deficiency due to a shift to a desk-based economy. Using bacteria-killing, lung-irritating cleaning products. Antibacterial wipes. Genetics. Hormones. Using dishwashers, which remove all traces of potentially protective bacteria from our crockery. Antibiotics. Increasing C-section births and decreasing rates of breastfeeding, both of which seem to impact the newborn microbiome and are associated with higher rates of allergy. Climate change causing higher levels of pollen. Air pollution. The use of proton pump inhibitors like Nexium for digestive issues. Even garden cities and our increased focus on greening urban areas might be increasing nasal allergies. “Studies have shown that access to green spaces is good for our mental health. Except that when I read about green projects now, because of my research, I’m like, ‘Oh no, what kind of trees are they going to plant though?’”Fundamentally, what Allergic shows is that our immune systems haven’t adapted to the modern world at all. “Several clinicians told me that if we could run an experiment where everyone lives the way they lived in 1600, allergies would drop; but, of course, none of us are going to do that,” she says. Fascinatingly, MacPhail also notes that companion animals like cats and dogs are also becoming more allergic, but that there is no sign of the same thing happening to wild animals, which points to a big part of the puzzle being inside our homes.“We all want there to be one answer. And then we can just all stop doing X, whatever X is, and the problem of allergy goes away. That’s not how it works – it’s way too complex and highlights how little we know about basic immune mechanisms.” MacPhail would love to see more money going towards a better understanding of allergies and the immune system, rather than applied research looking for drug treatments which just tweak dials within the immune system, and which have side effects. “I hope Bill Gates reads the book, because his global healthcare budget is $8bn. Not to be too cynical, but pharmaceutical companies make a lot of money off allergies, because they’re usually lifelong. Dupixent, for example, is a really amazing drug and does great things for people with eczema, but it has to be taken for life. It costs up to $4,200 a month. It’s already a $4bn drug, and could be a $12-$20bn drug by the time they’re done. It is very lucrative just to tamp down the immune system.”‘If you avoid something, you can accidentally trigger an allergy because you are denying your immune system the training it needs to tolerate it.’ Photograph: David Hoare/AlamyMacPhail worries that the book can’t do what people may hope for. “Allergies really mess with people’s existence and their quality of life is dramatically lowered. Everything from sleep to alertness to mood. There are higher rates of depression and anxiety among people who have moderate to severe allergies, and parents of children who have a deadly food allergy have greater anxiety levels than someone who has just had a cardiac event. It’s a lot to live with. And for me to show up on the scene and say, ‘I’m so sorry, there’s no easy solution,’ is not what people want to hear.”Granted, my situation is nowhere near as dire as other families, but I actually found the book deeply reassuring. Now I know there is no way that I can midnight-Google the source of my daughter’s allergies and that the causes are way beyond my individual control, I can put down my quest, and concentrate on reducing her symptoms as much as possible.“Allergy sufferers are canaries in the coalmine,” says MacPhail, who is no longer quite so cheery. “Allergy rates are just going to keep climbing. We need to start thinking about hard things, and we need to start doing hard things, which maybe means completely reorganising the way we approach everything. We have two options, and one is really, really hard. The other one is really, really hard in a different way. Our bodies are not comfortable. We are irritating ourselves to death.”Allergic: How Our Immune System Reacts to a Changing World, by Theresa MacPhail (Allen Lane, £25), is available from guardianbookshop.com at £21.25TopicsAllergiesThe ObserverHealthHealth & wellbeingfeaturesReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedFashionFoodRecipesLove & sexHome & gardenHealth & fitnessFamilyTravelMoneyNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Photograph: Sasipa Muennuch/Getty ImagesThe ObserverCroatia holidaysLet’s Split: Croatian island-hopping is heavenlyCroatia’s miles of isles are easy hops from Split by ferry – and next year those ferries are going electric. Eva Wiseman and family explore the country’s little pockets of paradiseEva WisemanSun 28 May 2023 06.00 EDTCroatia’s coast is made up of 1,200 islands – some are glamorous and hotelled, some are grand rocks enveloped by gulls. Some are for naturists, some are for fishermen, some have lagoons so blue they appear Photoshopped. The most sensible and affordable way to travel between these islands is by ferry and, next year, the journeys will become more sensible still. Croatian national ferry company Jadrolinija is going electric. Designed to transport up to 1,000 passengers and 156 cars each, the new ferries will operate between Split and its nearby islands. And as well as emitting fewer harmful gases, they promise to cut down journey times by up to half an hour. It’s time to start planning your trip.I started in Split, for a week of island hopping. My family and I had a day to kill there before our afternoon ferry – we immediately cursed ourselves for not adding another two or three. We walked through the Old Town’s white limestone streets, and took a tour of Diocletian’s Palace, a Unesco World Heritage site dating back to AD 295 (and a recent film location for Game of Thrones). With more than 200 buildings within an eight-acre enclosed space, the “palace” is a mini-city of its own, a fabulous tangle of streets and bars and homes which lean drunkenly against ancient walls.Square roots: the white piazza in Hvar. Photograph: Getty ImagesToo soon, we took the ferry to Hvar town, and drove inland from the harbour, with its glamorous wide white piazza, through green hillsides ridged by olive groves, vineyards and lavender fields, until we reached the island’s highest point. Leaning over to see the sea, a light wind made me nervous. Lunch was at Konoba Kokot in Dol, at a table in the back garden of a family home, lamb cooked all morning in a pot covered with ashes, and as much grappa as we could politely drink. Later, a speedboat took us towards the tiny, carless, Pakleni islands.On Sveti Klement, one of Dalmatia’s most famous restaurants is expanding to offer a small collection of luxurious rooms for those who just don’t want to go home. We were the first guests at Zori Timeless, in our own tiny house the colour of clay, with our own tiny pool the colour of the sky. Peacocks squawked, and we ate grilled fish at sunset. This little archipelago is sometimes badly translated as “Hell’s Islands”, despite feeling very much like paradise.Jewel of the Adriatic: Bol on Brac. Photograph: Tuul and Bruno Morandi/AlamyThe Adriatic sea, even in what locals groaned was the grimmest weather they’d seen in years, was deep blue and sparkling. Very quickly we entered a serious love affair with the boats. The speedboats were the best, arriving on one island seemingly before we’d even left the last. But the ferries were glamorous too, with their open-air seating and chic little bars, and ice-cream. Elderly couples held hands on the top deck, my children caused havoc below.The next evening we took another ferry to Brač, then drove across the island in the moonlight to a town called Bol. We checked into a self-catering flat called Azzurra, on a steep hill which led down to the sea. The Bol promenade takes you along the seashore all the way to Zlatni Rat beach, which backs on to a pine forest and is described as the most beautiful in Croatia. We were here off-season, the beach empty, the cats hungry, the sunset obscene.‘We ate grilled fish at sunset’: Zori Timeless on Sveti KlementFrom Bol to Supetar, and a car ferry back to Split, where we settled in for dinner at Konoba Varos, an old restaurant with wooden booths and huge platters of seafood, then spent the night at Cornaro hotel in the Old Town. We took a final dash through the square to say goodbye to the sea. As a ferry departing for Korcula pulled out of the harbour a family waved wildly from the deck, and we, departing for London, waved wildly back.Easy hops from SplitThree more islands for hiking, biking and mongoose spotting‘Cut off from foreign visitors until 1989’: Vis. Photograph: Getty ImagesVis The gorgeous Vis is the furthest Croatian island from the coast, and was cut off from foreign visitors until 1989. Its serenity and lack of development quickly became its main attraction as a tourist destination – visitors flocked to its famous Blue Cave, with its unearthly blue light. The island’s popularity grew again following the 2018 release of the movie Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again, filmed here, with the island restyled as a Greek resort.‘Pleasing draw in the heat of summer’: Solta. Photograph: AlamySolta The little island of Solta is perfect for hiking and biking, with narrow paths winding through the woods, a particularly pleasing draw in the dead heat of summer. There are olive groves, vineyards and a selection of unspoiled beaches, as well as busier beaches at Rogač, the main ferry port for the frequent (and affordable) services from Split.‘Aleppo pine perfume fills the air’: Mljet. Photograph: Jimmy Lung/Getty ImagesMljet Nicknamed the Green Island due to a rich forest of Aleppo pine – its perfume fills the air. Mljet national park makes up most of the island, but there are also several villages, two saltwater lakes, and a Benedictine monastery. It’s possible to hike around all day and see nothing but a mongoose – they roam free here after being brought in to rid the island of snakes.TopicsCroatia holidaysThe ObserverEurope holidaysfeaturesReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedTravelUSEuropeUKNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Or, rather, he’s been taking me, as it’s right beside his school and he’s taken to running straight into it with the pace of a greased pig, leaving me to chuff and bluster after him. Speed, he likes to tell me, is one of his main superpowers. He has several now, with strength and stamina close behind. It’s his speed, however, which comes in most useful here, since he knows that once he’s through its gates, I will be powerless to remove him. There will be other parents present and the social conventions of parenting among strangers mean I will be too mortified to scream after him.I’d be annoyed if I didn’t find these trips so anthropologically compelling, and if it didn’t also give his baby sister a chance to crawl around. The surface is soft and padded, made not of that slightly spongy playground aggregate I knew growing up, but an altogether more boingy substance covered in thick, wispy fibres somewhere between artificial grass and cow’s fur. Together with the playground’s cheerily undulating topography, it gives the uncanny sense of walking over an unmade bed. It is, in short, one of the few spaces on Earth in which you could not perceive of a baby finding injury, but this is balanced out by the fact it is usually filled with children whose spatial awareness, and moral reluctance to stamping on babies’ heads, could both be termed areas for improvement.Adults too should just approach anyone and ask to be their friend because they are wearing a cool hatWith one eye on her, I make sure to observe her brother. In the past year, he’s developed the first sticky filaments of a social life. To watch him courting potential friends is thrilling, and occasionally painful. He has a simple process. He just asks people to be his friend. I don’t mean ‘in so many words’, I mean he literally approaches someone who looks fun and says ‘can we be friends?’. Others do the same to him in turn, and so propagates the daisy chain of companionship which prevails in the four-year-old population.Most kids say ‘OK’ and run away, instigating an impromptu game of tag that serves as the on-boarding for this nascent friendship. Other times – rarely, but not so rarely that the spectre of several such incidents won’t haunt me until the day I die – I watch as would-be pals issue a terse ‘no’ and return to whatever they were doing beforehand. At this, he fumbles with his fingers and moves on to the next person, entirely unmoved. He is, in this sense, hardier than I, since I can barely watch such rejections without wanting to cry on his behalf.Watching, it’s hard to tell what adults have actually gained from masking our true wants and needs with decades of ingrained repression and social performance. Would it not be better if we could all just approach anyone on the tube and ask to be their friend because they were wearing a cool hat?I say this to parents I meet, and they laugh in agreement. Sometimes they have cool hats but, moral cowards that we are, we do not pledge to be best friends. Instead, as we watch our children do it a dozen times in as many minutes, we silently envy their greatest superpower.Did Ye Hear Mammy Died? by Séamas O’Reilly is out now (Little, Brown, £16.99).

So here I am, clambering atop my soapbox once more, megaphone in hand, to preach to the many unconverted my message that all wine-drinkers’ lives would be richer with a little orange in their lives. It seems to me that the best of these wines combine the best qualities of white and red wines – the freshness and raciness of whites; the chew and complexity of reds – to make something original. In fact, the term orange covers such a broad spectrum of colours and styles – from wines that are all-but-indistinguishable from whites in appearance and flavour to the dark amber and nuttily sherry-like – it makes generalisations about the category every bit as flawed as they are for red wine. Better, perhaps, to treat each orange wine as an individual, capable, as Viña González Bastias’s glorious muscat-based example is, of sui generis flavours and textures such as, in this case, the combination of mouthwatering citrus pith tang and chewiness with floral, muscat grapey prettiness.Blackbook Slow Disco Sauvignon Blanc, Essex, England 2021 (£19, Blackbook Winery) Orange wines are effectively the red wines of the white grape world. Just as red wines get their colour, chewy tannins and much of their flavour complexity from the (red) grape skins, so orange wines are made by keeping the juice of white grapes in contact with the skins for an extended period during fermentation. Most white wines, by contrast, are made solely from the juice of white grapes, while rosé wines, which at their palest are effectively the white wines of the red grape world, are made from red grapes which have only been in very brief contact with the skins. Much of the stylistic range in orange wines derives from each winemaker’s skin-maceration recipe. Some producers, such as Battersea-based urban winery Blackbook, give their pristine, Essex-grown sauvignon blanc fruit just a few (12) days of skin contact, which gives a colour at the golden end of the white wine spectrum and a little extra texture to the classic tropical-citrus-elderflower sauvignon flavours.Vinos Oceanicos Las Cepas Paco El Reflejo Blanco Viña del Gurugú y Finca M Alta, Jerez, Spain 2019 (£32, Les Caves de Pyrene) Also at the lighter end of the spectrum, Asda’s Gros Manseng Vin Orange 2022 (£7), made from the wonderfully tropical-trangy titular grape variety from Gascon, southwest France, is excellent value (as so many wines are from this region), offering a gentle touch of tannic grip to its vibrant Lilt-like flavours. At the other extreme, the original modern master of orange wine, Josko Gravner, gives his extraordinary, deep, dark amber, symphonically complex and resonant Gravner Ribolla Gialla, Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Italy 2014 (£100, nattyboywines.co.uk; selfridges.com) five months of skin contact in buried clay amphorae (he also ages the wines, once separated from the skins, for a further six years in large oak casks). For the no-less-extraordinary Vinos Oceanicos wine, meanwhile, winemaker Raúl Moreno creates a wine that combines the Marmite and almond notes of manzanilla sherry with preserved lemon tang in a gorgeously silky, utterly original package.Follow David Williams on Twitter @DaveydaibachTopicsWineDavid Williams's wines of the weekFoodfeaturesReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedFashionFoodRecipesLove & sexHome & gardenHealth & fitnessFamilyTravelMoneyNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Meal for two, starters £7.50-£8.50, mains £16-£29, desserts £7.50, wines from £24The restaurant stands by the river. The river runs down to the sea, where the fish swim deep. The fish are brought to the restaurant that stands by the river which runs down to the sea. Do excuse me, but there’s just something about the simplicity of Lir, hard by the River Bann in Northern Ireland, which brings out the terrible Ernest Hemingway parody act in me. I promise it won’t happen again. The Coleraine business was born out of a fascination with the sea, and a belief by owners Rebekah and Stevie McCarry that not enough of the fabulous seafood caught by the day boats working off the Northern Irish coast ends up being eaten by those who live on the shore.The idea behind Lir, an old Irish word for sea, may be simple; the journey to get here was not. In January 2020 they took over the gracefully knackered yacht club at Coleraine, with plans for their restaurant. A pandemic got in the way. With a young family to support, they set up an online fishmonger’s, delivering local fish to local doors, wrapped only in paper tied with twine. Eventually, they were able to open the kitchen, but the facilities were so basic they headed towards street food: lobster rolls, squid shawarma, ling fish dogs and the like.‘You don’t know whether to eat it or put it on a plinth’: monkfish sausage roll.Eventually they raised the money for a refurbishment which ended up taking more than two years. In the meantime, they set up another venue called the Pool, in a bare-bones shed on the beach at Portstewart, which housed a wet-fish counter, a restaurant and a live events space. It had shutters for walls and when the storms came, as they always do around these parts, it would flood. One surge almost wiped them out. Even so the Pool went on to win multiple restaurant awards.Now here they are, back in the refurbished yacht club, which is clean-lined and broad. It has sexy downlighters, tasteful art and a cocktail menu involving strong spirits and butch foraged things like gorse. There’s a deck overlooking the placid river and a menu headed by a declaration of intent. They are, they say, about zero waste and sustainability; about whole fish butchery, fermenting, smoking and generally sticking close to home. Once they’ve got the fillets, they use the rest for stocks and fish sausages and even fish-based charcuterie. All of which profound nerdiness is delightful but useless if the slogans don’t result in good things to eat. They do.‘A golden-brown barrel-shaped piece of beautifully cooked white fish’: hake ‘Kiev’. Photograph: Kelvin Boyes/Press EyeSome of them are very good indeed, and expressed via a profoundly Northern Irish commitment to portions that will get you through a hard winter, even if it’s spring. Here comes a deep-fried hake “Kiev”. It’s a golden-brown barrel-shaped piece of beautifully cooked white fish, the size of a one-person submarine. It’s filled with a wild garlic butter emulsion, the green of grass clippings, and comes with a properly sustaining pillow of mash, and shredded savoy cabbage pelted with crisp bacon lardons. Cut into the fish, and watch the dish self-sauce, until everything is lubricated with the finest garlic butter known to humanity.They like their sauces at Lir. A monkfish sausage roll, the glossy puff pastry so exquisitely laminated you don’t know whether to eat it or put it on a plinth, comes with a thick fermented chilli ketchup with just the right bash of warming heat. A judicious spoonful of gochujang has been added to the mayo with the kimchi slaw that lies beneath a rustling pile of crispy squid. A slab of beef short rib has first been brined with spent coffee grounds, then slow-cooked for two days before being seared. It reads performatively, doesn’t it? Look at all the fiddly things we have done to this small rectangle of quality meat. But who doesn’t love a good story, when it produces something as delightfully tender and crisp as this? And of course, it comes with their own sauce, a brown one made with the deep caramel tones of a local IPA.‘Brined with a spent coffee grounds’: braised short rib. Photograph: Kelvin Boyes/Press EyeI could whinge about the mackerel caesar salad, because it’s a deconstruction. On one side is a slab of little gem, dribbled with something creamy and caesar-like. On the other is a sourdough crouton piled with shredded pieces of hot smoked mackerel and curls of parmesan. No, it isn’t a caesar. It’s various things that might be involved with a caesar. But if you put the title aside, it is a very good dish. The lettuce is sprinkled with cured and fried pieces of ling, playing the part of bacon lardons. The mackerel is oily, smoky and pleasingly intense.The menu here changes daily. Tonight’s main courses include satiny pockets of well-made pasta filled with salt cod, in a classic butter sauce, and a sweet and nutty barley and wild mushroom risotto on a pea purée. It’s topped with a fist-sized piece of miso-glazed and roasted monkfish. It’s inventive and thoughtful stuff, without being annoyingly so. There are occasional missteps. A lobster béarnaise sauce served with a long-aged ex-dairy-cow sirloin sounds like a very good idea. It’s just overly acidic. Happily, it’s balanced out by a lovely little tartlet of caramelised onion in a cup of flaky pastry. We finish with a wobbly slice of miso caramel tart and a chocolate sponge ice-cream sandwich.‘A wobbly slice’: miso caramel tart. Photograph: Kelvin Boyes/Press EyeFaced by a menu of monkfish, mackerel, ling and so much else, even one which makes a point of using every part of the fish, questions of sustainability do have to be addressed. I am assured that, unlike some seafood places, at Lir they know which local boats the catch comes from and the skippers doing the catching. They know, too, which fishing grounds are sustainable and which species are thriving there. The fishmonger’s remains a part of the business, as is the streetfood offering, under the name Native Seafood & Scran. If you can’t get a table inside for the more intricate menu, come to the deck for squid bhajis and lobster sesame toast. In an area not renowned for its ambitious restaurant choices, this is one which deserves to thrive.Also, if you happen to be nearby and in need of breakfast, head to the truly delightful Babushka café on the harbour at Portrush. They do a very strong line in smoky beans, with exceptional sausages and bacon from a local butcher. I dream still of their breakfast bun, filled with soy and gochujang-glazed crispy pork belly and red cabbage slaw. That will get you going the morning after.News bitesKino, the restaurant attached to the home of Opera North in Leeds, has appointed a new chef to replace the Middle Eastern MorMor, whose residency has come to an end. Josh Whitehead, a former Professional MasterChef semi-finalist, joins from the Coach and Horses in Harrogate. Until 11 June he is running a preview ‘Test Kitchen’ menu, with two courses for £24 and three for £29. It includes roast duck with braised endive, and popcorn polenta with grilled and tempura mushrooms and grilled onions. A full menu will then run from the end of June (kinoleeds.co.uk).Carinito, a renowned Taco restaurant in Mexico City, is coming to London for a two-month residency from the end of May. The Carinito team will be in residence at the wine bar Oranj in Shoreditch, with a menu including guacamole with British brown shrimps, pulled pork belly with rice powder, chicharron and fresh mint, and confit cauliflower with citrus and fermented bean puree. Visit @oranj on Instagram for more.With all the interest in new openings, it’s easy to forget the pioneers. Farewell then to one of them: the great Brian Stein, founder of the Maxwell’s Restaurant Group, who has died aged 79. At its peak in 2010, Maxwell’s, an American bar and grill, had outposts all over London and in Oxford and employed more than 400 people, though eventually fell victim to the pandemic. The original in Hampstead was the first restaurant I went to as a precocious teen, without parents in tow. The memory of it holds a rather special place in my overfed heart.Email Jay at jay.rayner@observer.co.uk or follow him on Twitter @jayrayner1TopicsFoodJay Rayner on restaurantsRestaurants (Travel)FishRestaurants (Food)featuresReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedFashionFoodRecipesLove & sexHome & gardenHealth & fitnessFamilyTravelMoneyNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

It’s a good time to tell him you do not want to be used as a sexual objectPhilippa PerrySun 28 May 2023 01.01 EDTLast modified on Sun 28 May 2023 03.51 EDTThe question Content warning: this article contains descriptions of sexual assault.My husband and I have been married for nearly 35 years. I love him, but I no longer want to have sex with him. I cannot muster any enthusiasm at all. He still desires me, which is lovely… I suppose.He hasn’t changed any of his “moves” in all the years we’ve been having sex, and they have become less appealing. When I had some libido, I could work myself up into finding enthusiasm. Those days are gone.I’ve tried to explain, and I’ve tried new ways of trying to make love. I’ve had sex when it is the last thing I feel like doing. I’ve performed a sex act when I haven’t wanted to, I suppose because I feel that there ought to be some sexual intimacy in a marriage.Today, he pushed me on to the bed, forced my legs apart and mauled at me. I think he thought it was sexy. I was livid and shaken, angry and then I was tearful. He didn’t rape me. I don’t know what he thought he was doing. I hated it and I’m so sick of him constantly pawing at me.It’s not just that I don’t feel sexual, he seems to just want to pound away at me. I suspect that he has been turning to porn and if that’s the case, and that’s what he’s basing his “moves” on, then I can’t see me ever wanting to have sex with him again.I think I’d like to stay married. I’ve worked hard at my relationship and my family unit. It feels like a huge thing to tell him that I no longer want him sexually. Today though, he went too far. As our friends are mutual, I have no one to talk to about this.Philippa’s answer You might not want to say that was rape. I would, however, call it sexual assault. It was neither consensual nor loving. I feel upset on your behalf. Being violated by someone you love will feel confusing. I’m not surprised you felt shaken, tearful and angry.I might be wrong, but I get the impression that he is using you for sex. I noticed when you talk about sex with your husband the pronoun “we” is missing. You talk about “I” and “he” – it doesn’t sound like a shared, mutual act of love. It sounds more like something that is done to you, which isn’t usually the sort of sex that makes partners feel closer, and it is driving you from him. Being pawed is very different from a caressing, loving touch. Even when you had libido, you talk of working yourself up to find enthusiasm rather than becoming aroused together. You don’t want to be an object he tries out his “moves” on.You do not have to be used; no one has a right to sex just because they are in a marriage. I think after that assault it is a good time to tell him that although you love him and you think you want to stay married you cannot, as things stand, imagine desiring him sexually ever again and you do not want to be used as a sexual object. It will be a tough conversation and it may be easier to have with a couples counsellor present.I would call it sexual assault – it was neither consensual nor lovingCouples counselling might be how you find your way through this. Finding a way through doesn’t mean it is you who has the problem. This is happening between you. It’s not just a dropping-off of libido. Hormonal changes don’t cause problems so much as put a magnifying glass on to problems that already exist, so I don’t think you not wanting sex with your husband is something that should be fixed only with medication.It is more important to unpick the many things that affect sexual intimacy, which include your individual beliefs around sex, what meanings you each put on sex, your physical and emotional wellbeing, and how you feel you are seen and experienced by each other, as well as your actual experience and expectations. It may also mean finding out how he feels about staying married if you no longer have sex and/or how you might feel if he gets his desires met elsewhere.You have tried to talk to him about how you feel about your sex life together, but the message is not getting through. There is a communication problem, and you feel unheard. This may be a difficult problem to overcome. Initially, phone two or three relationship therapists and choose the one you’d feel most comfortable opening up to (try cosrt.org.uk).An experience like yours is a difficult thing to share when all your friends are mutual. I think it would help you get clearer about what you want if you talk this through with an individual counsellor too (try welldoing.org). You have experienced what sounds like a sexualised attack in your own home.

Photograph: yhelfman/Getty Images/iStockphotoSan FranciscoVacant skyscrapers, empty trains: can San Francisco once again reinvent itself?The economic challenges of the city’s downtown have sparked speculation of a so-called ‘doom loop’. But some say its emptiness may be part of the solutionIsabeau Doucet in San FranciscoSun 28 May 2023 07.00 EDTThe operator of the gondola that services Salesforce Park, an oasis among the skyscrapers in downtown San Francisco, will tell you all about how the 5-acre (2-hectare) rooftop space you’re about to enter contains 1,600 plants, 600 trees and more than a dozen ecosystems.From this far up the fortress walls, the city looks like a futuristic utopia, with office workers milling about in the sun and free yoga on Fridays.The food court rising above San Francisco’s ‘doom loop’: ‘We’re breaking down stereotypes’Read moreBut the transit center underneath – the newly built hub that was announced before the pandemic with great fanfare and was supposed to ferry in workers from all over the region to downtown – is quiet, save for the metaphorical tumbleweeds. The city’s main public transport systems are collapsing under the weight of their own emptiness. The number of riders on the Bart system is around 40% of what it was before the pandemic, and only 30% for riders who exit in downtown San Francisco. Without a $5bn bailout, service cuts to some of the city’s transit lines could start as soon as this summer.Once home to some of the most expensive and sought-after office space in the world, San Francisco today is suffering from one of the most hollowed-out downtowns in North America.Walking along Market Street, the main thoroughfare, “office space available” and “for sale or lease” signs solicit new businesses. Office vacancy in the first quarter of 2023 ranged between 26.4% and 29.4%, depending on the tally. It’s a steep increase from the historic low vacancy rate of 4% in early 2020. Pinterest, Meta, Reddit, Salesforce, Slack, Uber and Twitter have all vacated or reduced their office space as remote or hybrid work has prevailed.The emptiness has made some of the city’s other problems – an enduring homelessness emergency, open-air drug use in some neighborhoods and high rates of property crime – seem more visible. And it has sparked speculation that the city is at the verge of a so-called “doom loop”, a spiral down into debt that will force it to cut social and transportation services, which will in turn perpetuate more disinvestment.The city has seen an enduring homelessness emergency. Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty ImagesSan Francisco’s chief economist, Ted Egan, thinks that label is probably premature. “To me, a doom loop is Detroit in the 1970s. There’s nothing you can do to bring auto plants back – every auto plant that closes makes the next one want to close, and a cycle of disinvestment makes people want to disinvest more.”It’s everything but tech that hasn’t recoveredEconomist Ted EganDespite layoffs in past months, the tech economy of the Bay Area is strong, argued Egan, with more tech jobs in the city now than at the start of the pandemic. Unemployment in the city is the second lowest in the state, he said.But he admitted the city faces significant challenges. “It’s everything but tech that hasn’t recovered,” he said – and without businesses downtown, why would anyone go there?Downtown businesses suffer, city coffers dwindleTech workers in the Bay Area built the tools for working remotely and then embraced remote work more than any other region in the US, according to the US Census Bureau. For the restaurants, cafes and bars that serviced those workers, and the small businesses and retail that depended on workers’ foot traffic, the consequences were stark.A study out of the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of Toronto comparing mobile phone data across 62 downtowns in North America found that San Francisco’s recovery is dead last, with only 31% of the activity it had pre-pandemic.“Before [the pandemic] it was always very busy, but now it’s very slow,” said Lydia Wong, who has been serving to-go comfort food at Yo-Yo’s, a Japanese mom-and-pop lunch shop in the financial district, since 1988. “We can watch Netflix now,” her husband, Joseph Lee, joked.The Old Ship Saloon, a bar that serves craft beer and pub grub and has been open since 1851, is lucky to still be around. “A lot of bars and restaurants have gone out of business,” said Eric Rogers, a bartender who was working solo through a mini lunch rush.The Old Ship Saloon was originally converted from a 19th-century sailing ship, the Arkansas, which is still buried in the bar’s foundations. Since the pandemic, the bar’s owners have had to pare down staff in order to make any money. “We just count ourselves lucky that we’re still able to be open. You have to work harder,” said Rogers while pouring drinks, taking orders, serving food and working the cash register.At the moment, it’s mostly businesses downtown that are feeling the squeeze. But that slowdown is affecting city coffers, which in turn could spark cuts that will affect the entire city. More than 75% of the city’s total GDP is generated downtown, and the businesses there account for nearly half the city’s sales tax revenue and 95% of its business tax revenue. The city is staring down a $780m budget deficit over the coming two years due to rising costs and plummeting business, sales and transfer tax revenues, jeopardizing funding for essential services from public safety and cleaning to transportation.San Francisco really placed a bet on huge commercial office development, more than anywhere else maybe in the worldCalifornia assembly member Matt Haney“San Francisco really placed a bet on huge commercial office development, more than anywhere else maybe in the world,” said California assembly member Matt Haney. “They placed the biggest possible bet on something that went bottom-up. They lost. So now we have to adapt and adapt quickly.”According to Haney, part of the solution lies in downtown’s emptiness.With high-rises full of empty office space, many artists and low- and middle-income residents priced out, and the most disadvantaged residents of the city housing themselves on its sidewalks, could this vacancy crisis be an opportunity to tackle this emergency in housing and homelessness?Haney is proposing a state bill that would circumvent some of the notorious red tape that hinders the construction of new housing by fast-tracking the permitting process to convert offices into housing in empty downtowns.“If we’ve already approved an office building, we shouldn’t treat it as though it’s a new housing development and force it to go from square one with all the hearings, appeals and fees,” said Haney. “It’s in the public interest to get housing in a building that would otherwise be an empty office, and so we’re going to essentially waive everything to make that happen.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First ThingFree daily newsletterStart the day with the top stories from the US, plus the day’s must-reads from across the GuardianPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That population is gone and not coming back. It will be a doom loop if the city doesn’t make it a top priority to convert commercial to residential,” he said.It will be a doom loop if the city doesn’t make it a top priority to convert commercial to residentialDean Baker of the Center for Economic and Policy ResearchGensler, one of the largest architecture firms in the world, has a metric for assessing buildings’ suitability for conversion, and in a report published earlier this year by the San Francisco Bay Area Planning and Urban Research Association, it found that converting downtown offices in San Francisco could physically accommodate around 11,200 housing units. But these conversions are not financially feasible given the current challenges to building in the city, the firm said.“I think it would make a lot of conversions more possible,” said Holly Arnold, an architect who leads Gensler’s residential practice in the Bay Area, when asked about the proposed bill. A lot of developers stay away from San Francisco because they “just don’t have the stomach or the tolerance to be able to go through the process”.Egan, the city’s chief economist, is skeptical that office-to-housing conversions are going to change the dynamics of downtown in time to save any small businesses. “It’s not going to be the horse that pulls the cart. It might be the cart. But I tend to think that the return of office workers, one way or the other, is going to be the thing that does it.”Owners prop up teetering real estate valuesFor the city’s property taxes and for property investors, the real crisis will hit in the coming years if office leases start to expire with no one willing to sign on. The office availability rate is currently at 35%. But rents aren’t budging as much as you’d expect in a market with such little demand and so much availability.The Salesforce Transit Center and Park. Photograph: Eric Risberg/AP“My guess as to why office rents have not fallen more is that the owners are worried about the impact on appraisals for either new loans or sales,” said Dean Baker. “If you cut the rent by 50%, that will quickly be reflected in an appraisal.”Sitting in Salesforce Park was Chris Carlsson, a local historian and co-director of Shaping San Francisco, which provides walking, biking and bay cruise history tours of the city. He gestured to the soaring towers around.He thinks their value is about to crater. “The people holding that value will lose it. And they will be sad, and they’ll be jumping off buildings, and they’ll be freaking out,” said Carlsson, who sheds no tears for property investors. “That’s fine. That’s capitalism, right?”Start taking stuff down. Why have these towers here if there’s no use for them?Chris Carlsson of Shaping San Francisco“What does a de-worked downtown look like?” Carlsson mused. He thinks converting as many buildings to residences is one answer. But there’s another option. “Deconstruction is a possibility,” he said. “Start taking stuff down. Why have these towers here if there’s no use for them?“Maybe there will end up being waterslides in there,” he added, only half joking. “Five stories of waterslides and amusement parks. Why not make giant pinball arcades?”Some 175 years ago, there was a gold rush that brought hundreds of ships from all over the world, down the road from where Salesforce Park is now located. Prospectors dreaming of riches couldn’t wait to anchor in San Francisco Bay before jumping ship, hundreds of which jammed the bay.Some entrepreneurial folks found ways of staking claim to prime real estate by running ships aground in the shallows of the bay. There are dozens of ships that make up the foundations of downtown San Francisco. Some folks will no doubt find a way to strike gold if and when this city’s commercial office market collapses too.Everywhere you go in the city, ruins of a former economy and culture now thrive in a completely new incarnation. A navy shipyard is repurposed as studios for hundreds of artists; an armory becomes an adult movie studio and then an event space; a church becomes a space for a roller skating disco party; the old federal penitentiary on Alcatraz island is one of the city’s most popular tourist destinations; a furniture shop becomes Twitter’s HQ.If the city could convert four blocks of downtown into a surreal rooftop garden, maybe – just maybe – it can transform these downtown offices into something better suited to the future.TopicsSan FranciscoHousingReal estateCaliforniaEconomic recoveryEconomicsCommunitiesfeaturesReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedBusinessEconomicsDiversity & equality in businessSmall businessRetailNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Photograph: Helen AbelesThe ObserverSpaceFrom fleeing Hitler to Mars: the scientist who changed space travelThe remarkable journey of Ben Abeles will be celebrated next week by the opening of a new archiveRobin McKie Science editorSun 28 May 2023 05.00 EDTBen Abeles’ impact on science was out of this world. He helped develop alloys that were key components of the radioisotope generators that powered US robot space probes on their interplanetary journeys. Nasa was then able to reveal the wonders of the solar system, from the ancient river beds of Mars to the icy moons of Jupiter.One of the devices is still in use, providing electricity for the Perseverance robot rover that currently trundles across the surface of the red planet.Abeles was a brilliant scientist, yet his start in life could not have been grimmer. He arrived in Britain from Prague as a child refugee on the Kindertransport, the rescue effort that helped around 10,000 children flee Nazi-occupied Europe and settle in Britain.This remarkable journey – from fleeing Hitler to extraterrestrial travel – will be celebrated next week when the University of Southampton opens an archive of documents and photographs that tell Abeles’ life story. Items will include the tag placed round his neck when he boarded the Kindertransport; the Stuart Ballantine medal, given to him in 1979 by the US Franklin Institute for his work on powering space probes; and a note, sent home in 1941, to tell his parents: “Am healthy. Working in kitchen.”At the end of the war, Abeles returned to what was then Czechoslovakia to search for his parents and elder sister but discovered they had died in the Trawniki concentration camp in Poland. He stayed on to study at university in Prague before emigrating to Israel and then on to New Jersey in 1956, where he worked as a physicist for 53 years.“Ben clearly went on to live a remarkable life after arriving on the Kindertransport and did great things,” said Tony Kushner, professor of history at the University of Southampton, who has been closely involved in establishing the archive. “But that is not the reason for allowing refugees into your country – because you think they will become brilliant scientists. You do it because it’s the right thing to do, regardless of their later careers. You take in refugees in order to save people’s lives.”This point was supported by his wife, Helen Abeles. “Ben always said that the real heroes of the Kindertransport were the parents,” she said. “They let go of their children to give them a chance. I just got on the train, he used to say. Why are they making such a fuss?”Ben Abeles died in December 2020, aged 95, and his family has given his archive to the university’s Parkes Institute, which houses one of the largest Jewish archives in western Europe.“He was the most positive person I have ever met, which, given the tragedies that he lived through and the difficulties of his early life, has always amazed me,” Helen Abeles told the Observer. “He was always conscious about wanting to give something back to society. So when he retired, he volunteered at a soup kitchen in New Jersey, for example.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterArchie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morningPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Photograph: Dean Moses/amNYNew York‘There were no rules down here’: New York resurrects popular skate parkThe Brooklyn Banks, known for being a ‘melting pot’ of skaters, bikers and artists like Keith Haring and Jean-Michel Basquiat, were closed off over a decade ago – until nowEdward Helmore in New YorkSun 28 May 2023 06.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 28 May 2023 06.06 EDTThe Brooklyn Bridge, an icon built to connect once separate cities, is 140 years old this year. But underneath the connecting roadways on the Manhattan side was a series of sloping red-brick embankments that in the 1980s became the birthplace of a gritty New York street-style of skateboarding – the Brooklyn Banks.Last week, the New York City mayor, Eric Adams, took a break from dealing with his city’s social and economic headaches to reopen the cambered banks – “waves” in skateboarder speak – and pay tribute to the skateboarding pioneers who helped turn the kick-flips and grinds of teenage outsiders into a global culture industry.Adams said he’d once been a skateboarder and knew a few moves. “I’m going to brush up on them, come out here and do a few tricks.”But he also made a larger point about city life, beyond the mainstream capture of the once-underground skateboarding culture that developed here.“Everyone needs open space. We witnessed that during Covid on how people needed those spaces to come and sit down and enjoy the recreation that’s attached to it, so this is an exciting moment.”The banks were closed off more than a decade ago to make space for roadway repair equipment. Then pressure from community groups, aided by skateboarding aficionados, including the pro skateboarder Tony Hawk and his non-profit The Skatepark Project, convinced a receptive city administration that the historic skate mecca merited attention as part of a $375m revitalization of public areas close to Chinatown.“It was a secret place, a place you had freedom to move about and no one bothered you,” recalled Steve Rodriguez, who first came here aged 15 and is now co-owner of 5Boro, a skateboard and apparel company. “No one cared about the space, so the skateboarders adopted it. It was a place to call our own.”People skate at the Brooklyn Banks skate park in 2010. Photograph: Mario Tama/Getty ImagesThe space wasn’t limited to just skateboarding – BMX bikers, graffiti artists, breakdancers and rollerbladers were all part of the banks community. “It was an ideal scenario – a melting pot. There were no rules down here,” Rodriguez says, recalling that artists like Keith Haring and Jean-Michel Basquiat were also hanging around.“I wouldn’t be surprised if there was a Samo tag around,” he says, referring to Basquiat’s graffiti tag.Rodriguez has been fighting for the banks, now officially called Gotham Park, since the early 2000s, when a reduction in space was first threatened. In 2010, the city closed the banks, ostensibly to repaint the underside of the roadways. But they were not automatically returned, and some of the red bricks were torn up.The city maintains about 40 skate parks run by the parks department. But few say they have the appeal of lost spaces with walls, benches and stair rails to perform tricks on. The first section of the Brooklyn Banks to be reopened includes a nine-stair section, known as the “9 Stair”.“When we were at the banks, no one knew we were there. We had nothing – the banks, a 25-cent juice, Burger King down the block, a supermarket and ourselves,” says Alex Corporan, who went on to become manager of the Supreme store in Nolita since 1996.“There were no parents allowed, or better no parents knew where the hell we were except that we’d come home for dinner at some point. It was so soulful, there was no agenda. We just wanted to be with each other.”At the opening Corporan says he was saw that same desire in the kids that came to try out the banks. “I could see they want to emulate that same energy. It was beautiful to see,” he says.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First ThingFree daily newsletterStart the day with the top stories from the US, plus the day’s must-reads from across the GuardianPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Photograph: Edward Helmore/The GuardianThat feeling of finding a sanctuary was repeated by many at the ceremony. “We were on our own deserted island, a place where you were not disturbed by any outside forces – you had the whole place to yourself,” said Jefferson Pang, a former professional skateboarder who learned at the banks and now also works at Supreme, a downtown skate clothing label founded in 1994 that has turned into a fashion mega-brand.“It’s amazing that so many people from the culture can actually thrive,” Pang said.A decade after the Banks were adopted by skateboarders, the Larry Clark film Kids, featuring Harmony Korine and Chloë Sevigny, helped put the downtown teen-skateboard scene on the cinematic map. Brooklyn Banks later appeared in Tony Hawk’s Underground, a popular video game, further elevating the banks as a cultural landmark.There are also signs that the skate industry, estimated at $2.54bn in 2021, has shifted in other ways. Despite being inclusive, it was generally seen as male lifestyle sport and now more women are finding sponsorship at the pro or semi-pro level. “My generation is the forefront of that,” said Beatrice Domond, at the unveiling. “It’s opening up but it’s still small, especially being a woman of color.”“It’s definitely becoming more diverse,” said Jaime Reyes. “For a while it wasn’t so welcoming, but now there just as many girls out here.”Meera Joshi, New York’s deputy mayor for operations, said the 140th anniversary of the completion of the Brooklyn Bridge, and the reopening of the banks, represented the “mini worlds and crossroads and many worlds”. She said the area showed that there’s no place in the world you could possibly have so much diversity and life in one small spot, none of it planned, all of it part of New York’s spontaneous and illogical magic.”Pang said the revival of the banks would be important to the global skate community. “There aren’t many places as recognizable as the Brooklyn Banks,” he said, noting that the Embarcadero in San Francisco, the West LA Courthouse Skate Plaza in Los Angeles and Pulaski Park in Washington DC – each one semi-mystical places for skateboarders – were either not skateable anymore or under threat.“Brooklyn Banks was always the No 1, and definitely one of the biggest and well-known spots in the world,” he said.TopicsNew YorkSkateboardingfeaturesReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedUSWorldEnvironmentSoccerUS PoliticsBusinessTechScienceNewslettersFight for democracyNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Photograph: Brandon SchulmanThe ObserverLong CovidInterviewImmunologist Akiko Iwasaki: ‘We are not done with Covid, not even close’David CoxThe Yale professor and long Covid expert on why the virus is causing ongoing illness for so many, and the challenges she faces as a woman of colour in scienceSat 27 May 2023 10.00 EDTAccording to the most recent estimates, more than 65 million people worldwide may be living with some form of long Covid, a startling number that will only continue to increase, given the lack of available treatment options.One of the scientists leading the race to try to unravel the complexities of long Covid is Akiko Iwasaki, an immunology professor at Yale School of Medicine. Iwasaki has been at the forefront of numerous research breakthroughs throughout the course of the pandemic, from understanding why men were more vulnerable to the Sars-CoV-2 virus, the autoimmunity that made some people unexpectedly susceptible, and why a small minority have experienced heart inflammation in response to the Covid-19 vaccines. Most recently, Iwasaki has been awarded the prestigious Else Kröner Fresenius Prize for Medical Research, worth €2.5m (£2.2m), in part due to her ongoing work on long Covid.Are we getting closer to understanding some of the causes of long Covid?Long Covid is a blanket term that likely describes multiple diseases with different causes. We still don’t have the answers, but there are some hypotheses that are becoming more likely and others less likely. There’s more evidence now showing either viral proteins or viral RNA in various tissues, months after infection. The hypothesis that long Covid symptoms could be caused by the reactivation of latent viruses such as Epstein-Barr virus is also gaining momentum. The other idea is that changes can occur due to the inflammation from an acute Sars-CoV-2 infection, both at the site of infection, and in distal organs such as the brain. We have a paper that we published last year which demonstrates that even a mild Sars-CoV-2 respiratory infection can result in long term changes in the brain.More than 200 symptoms have now been associated with long Covid, affecting almost every organ system in the human body. Many are also experienced by chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) sufferers. What similarities have been found in the biology of these two illnesses?One you’ve probably heard of is microclots, which appear to be happening in a large fraction of people from long Covid and potentially ME/CFS. These are tiny little clots in the blood that may be impairing oxygen exchange and other important functions of the circulation. The way blood oxygen is being utilised by tissues also appears to be impaired, which could be due to microclots as well as mitochondrial dysfunction.I always have in the back of my mind – how can these insights from long Covid help people with ME/CFS and other post-acute phases of infections, like post Lyme disease? I’m so excited about receiving this new award because it shows that long Covid and ME/CFS are diseases of global significance. It’s validation and acknowledgment for people who have been suffering for decades with ME/CFS, a disease that has been mostly ignored and completely understudied given the amount of suffering it has caused.What new treatment avenues are being explored for long Covid?We are starting a clinical trial where 50 patients will be treated with the antiviral drug Paxlovid and 50 will be given a placebo. This is to probe whether persistent virus infection may be causing long Covid in a subset of people. We’re not giving them the conventional five-day course, but a 15-day course of treatment, to see if that can eliminate the source of the problem, which is the remnants of replicating virus.Somehow mistreatment of junior staff has never been punished. People just keep doing it, and they get promotedYou’re a prolific tweeter, with more than 200,000 Twitter followers. How important a platform is it for scientific communication?I didn’t plan to have so many followers! I now have to be even more careful what I say, and how I say things because it is very easy to be misinterpreted. But Twitter has been an incredible platform. Within seconds, people can read about the latest scientific findings, and what they mean. I also often learn from people who are posting their symptoms and what has helped them. I think it’s still very important for me to keep tweeting fact-based scientific content – there’s a lot of misinformation and disinformation out there.But there are some days where I feel like I don’t even want to open it. The unfortunate side is that there are a lot of trolls and abusive comments, sometimes people with extreme viewpoints that clash with mine, or those who still don’t believe that long Covid is real and think it’s all in people’s heads.You’ve also spoken about toxic environments in real life, particularly in academia, where you’ve called out issues of bullying and sexism.This is still a big problem. Somehow bullying and mistreatment of junior staff has never been punished. People just keep doing it, and they get promoted and receive grants. This bullying occurs because many professors hold so much power that goes unchecked. Students and postdoctoral researchers rely on their recommendation letters to get their next job, so they can essentially be held hostage.You’ve also mentioned how being a prominent woman of colour in science means that you have to endure a greater degree of toxic behaviour from other academics. Do you think there is a racism issue within the scientific community?I think so. It’s very masked and veiled so it’s hard to pinpoint but I definitely feel like I’m spending more time thinking about how to respond to an email, because of my background, because I’m a woman, and because I’m a person of colour. There’s a lot of finessing of the words and making sure it’s assertive enough but doesn’t sound offensive. This struggle, and one that I’m sure others are going through, is double the work.Another challenge is that you get asked to serve on every committee, because they need to make every committee diverse and equitable. I get that, but it just means more work for people like myself, and less time to spend on research.Earlier this month, the World Health Organization downgraded Covid-19 from the status of “emergency of international concern”, while the Biden administration has officially declared an end to the Covid-19 public health emergency. What is your perspective on this – could the pandemic still have some twists to come?I understand why the emergency declaration had to be ended, because of the economic impact and other things. But at the same time, we are not done with Covid, not even close. The virus is here to stay with us and that’s why we do need to think about future booster vaccines that match with the circulating variants, as well as the potential of new variants that further evade our existing immunity.I get that people want to move on from the pandemic, but the virus is still out there, people are getting infected, and there’s the possibility of developing long Covid. I’m still wearing masks and following preventive practices as much as possible.TopicsLong CovidThe ObserverImmunologyHealthCoronavirusinterviewsReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedUKWorldClimate crisisNewslettersFootballCoronavirusBusinessEnvironmentUK politicsEducationSocietyScienceTechGlobal developmentObituariesNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Unmani has been assisting with the family’s visa applications for the past year and a half, after connecting with them through the not-for-profit Rural Australians for Refugees (RAR). She says growing up in a community-minded family shaped her global outlook.“I have always wanted to have more diversity in my world ,” she says. “When I was first married, I always thought there was something missing. All these faces, talking the same Strine, doing the same rituals. And I’m going, ‘Isn’t there more’?’“We need to open our hearts and have a spoonful more empathy. I’ve always thrived on the ways other cultures celebrate their life and life events.”Unmani Umani says she thinks of the day the Anwari’s arrive at Melbourne airport. ‘I’ll be crying.’ Photograph: Dellaram Vreeland/The GuardianAustralia’s humanitarian visa quota increased this year to 17,875 places, in response to rolling international crises. A spokesperson for the department of home affairs said the increase will “ensure we can provide permanent resettlement to those who need it”.The expanded intake includes 26,500 dedicated places for Afghan nationals, allocated over five years from July 2021 to July 2026.RAR receives thousands of requests for support from asylum seekers every year, says Marie Sellstrom, the Mansfield branch secretary and Merrijig resident. But they don’t have the resources or funding to keep up.The 81-year-old says the increase to the humanitarian intake is not enough.“Those current figures don’t even scrape the surface,” she says.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to The Rural NetworkFree newsletterSubscribe to Gabrielle Chan’s fortnightly update on Australian rural and regional affairsPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Photograph: David Zorrakino/Europa Press/GettyThe ObserverBarcelona‘They say I should clean floors’: Barcelona’s working-class, leftwing mayor Ada Colau fights for third termThe city’s first female mayor is reviled by the elites and pro-car lobby, but embraced by others for her social policiesStephen Burgen in BarcelonaSat 27 May 2023 12.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 27 May 2023 12.57 EDTAs Ada Colau tries to win a third and final term as mayor of Barcelona on Sunday, there is one thing her opponents have in common: that she is personally to blame for all the city’s ills, from bag snatching to traffic jams.The attacks on her are so insistent and so personalised that her campaign has even produced a T-shirt with the ironic slogan: La culpa de todo la tiene Ada Colau (It’s all Ada Colau’s fault).Catalan politics is a clubbish affair and Colau, with a background as a militant housing activist, is not a club member. She is a leftwing, bisexual feminist who prioritises the needs of working people over those who treat the city as a cash cow and whose first act as mayor was a moratorium on building hotels. From the old guard’s perspective, what’s to like?“I’m not just the first female mayor – I’m the first from a working-class background, and I’m not connected to the families that have always run Barcelona,” she told the Observer. “I’m reminded of this often, sometimes implicitly, at other times in a more explicit and disagreeable way.“There are politicians on the right who constantly question my appearance, my hair, my clothes, my ability, my lack of culture, who say I should be cleaning floors or selling vegetables or fish. But I’m here to change things. It’s true that there’s extra pressure because I’m a woman, but I see this as a part of what has to change.”We’ve invested a lot in schools; we’re leaders in social investment – structural changes that won’t be easily undoneMayor Ada ColauColau is active on social media but she really comes into her own as an old-school street campaigner. In 2015 her direct style and plain speaking won over voters weary of cronyism and nationalist rhetoric.Her communitarian platform Barcelona en Comú won by a whisker, and there was an initial period of transition from Colau the activist who fought the police to Colau the mayor who was responsible for them.It’s been a difficult eight years encompassing the political turmoil in Catalonia, the terror attack on La Rambla in 2017 that left 16 dead and 130 injured, and the pandemic.Ada Colau at a re-election event last month. Photograph: Paco Freire/Sopa Images/Shutterstock“I’m proud that in spite of all this we’ve changed the city’s agenda and that we have not only withstood these crises but we’ve also been able to build thousands of units of public housing and carry out an urban transformation to make the city greener, healthier and less polluted,” she says. “This is both an environmental and a social policy.“We’ve invested a lot in schools; we’re leaders in social investment – these are structural changes that won’t be easily undone. I want a third and last mandate in order to finish what we’ve started.”Two-way street: how Barcelona is democratising public spaceRead moreUnder Colau, Barcelona has become a role model for urban renewal, with planners from around the world visiting to see what the city has achieved – which is basically giving people priority over cars.This began with the so-called superblocks – groups of nine city blocks closed to through traffic – and has now been extended to the “green axis” in the Eixample, the grid system of streets designed by the engineer Ildefons Cerdà in the late 19th century.This has entailed pedestrianising 18 blocks of a crosstown, four-lane road as well as four intersecting streets with the creation of several squares.The car lobby hates it. Colau’s political rivals accuse her of parochialism and of treating the city like a village; architects say she is vandalising Cerdà’s design, though cars were not invented when he drew up the plan.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterArchie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morningPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

On the contrary: we’re coming to this late. Climate change is already herAda Colau“Certain elites don’t think we should touch the city centre without their permission because it touches on their privileges,” Colau says. “We’re simply applying common sense – 75% of journeys are made on foot or on public transport.It’s not that we’re going too fast – on the contrary, we’re coming to this late because climate change is already here, and too many are talking about independence instead of doing what needs to be done,” she says with a nod towards the Generalitat, the seat of the Catalan government, on the other side of Plaça Sant Jaume.On Catalan independence, she has moved from being opposed to taking a more neutral stance, describing herself as equidistante. Nevertheless she treads carefully, as many of her supporters are also pro-independence. For example, she rarely refers to Spain by name, calling it “the state”, a separatist formulation.She accepts that street crime is a continuing problem but denies that it has increased during her mandate, pointing out that “in all the international rankings we are one of the safest cities”. (Barcelona is 26th in the 2023 World’s Safest Cities rankings.)Is this the world’s most radical mayor? | Dan HancoxRead moreShe also denies that the city has lost the battle against mass tourism, but most citizens would disagree. After the two-year Covid lull, Barcelona is already saturated and it’s not even high season yet.Colau argues that the key is to diversify the economy, as the pandemic revealed how dependent the city is on tourism.“We’re the technological capital of southern Europe. We want to keep the talent we have and attract more. That’s the future.”Polls have Colau in a three-horse race with the conservative nationalist Xavier Trias, 76, whom she ousted as mayor in 2015, and the socialist Jaume Collboni, who abruptly quit her coalition in February in order to run against her.Both are willing to swallow their differences and join forces to keep Colau out. However, if she wins one more seat than either of them, she gets to call the shots.No one is indifferent to Ada Colau – people either love her or hate her. On Sunday we’ll know who has the upper hand.TopicsBarcelonaThe ObserverSpainGreen citiesAir pollutionCataloniaEuropefeaturesReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Photograph: Peter HoweFrom the Observer archiveNew YorkThe Red Berets ride to the rescue of New York subway commuters, 1979Help was at hand for ‘the worst routes, the least well-lit stations and the poorest, most violent neighbourhoods’Emma BeddingtonSun 28 May 2023 01.01 EDT‘Chivalry has returned to New York,’ proclaimed the Observer on 15 July 1979, as it descended into the lawless New York subway underworld, accompanied by the Magnificent Thirteen Subway Patrol, AKA the Red Berets. The group had formed that February, in response to a violent crime wave. From an initial 13, they now numbered nearly 100 and their mission was to make New Yorkers feel safer. ‘They are in their late teens or early 20s, most of them have some training in the martial arts and all are as streetwise as alley cats.’It was important to know that the group were ‘not vigilantes. We’re out here to protect people, not lynch them’Working-class and from diverse ethnic backgrounds, most worked or studied during the day. Their leader was the charismatic Curtis ‘the Rock’ Sliwa, ‘a poor 23-year-old Polish-American who graduated in garbage collecting and street fighting’.The Red Berets patrol ‘the worst routes, the least well-lit stations and the poorest, most violent neighbourhoods’. The Observer sensibly tagged along for the first 8pm to midnight shift when the police were still on duty. ‘When the cops go off at 2am it’s looneyville,’ explained Sliwa. But it proved uneventful and there’s a palpable frustration at the lack of action: barring an anticlimactic encounter with a drunk man at 8.40pm, and a giggling gang of girls asking for the Red Berets’ autographs, it’s mainly colourful descriptions of menacing stations (‘water drips, shadows tremble’) and recounting of previous skirmishes. ‘One of them, a giant, picks up Keith by the neck, strangling him. I kick him in the head – left my footprint on his face.’ For all that, Sliwa wanted to clarify the group were ‘not vigilantes. We’re out here to protect people, not lynch them.’Clocking off at 12.34am without even a sniff of action, the journalist was nevertheless impressed. ‘The youngsters who do it are – there’s no other word for it – amazing.’TopicsNew YorkFrom the Observer archiveUS crimefeaturesReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedUSWorldEnvironmentSoccerUS PoliticsBusinessTechScienceNewslettersFight for democracyNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Photograph: J Daniel Hud/ZUMA Press Wire/ShutterstockThe death toll from a Russian missile attack on a clinic in Dnipro has risen from two to four people, according to the region’s governor.In a post on Telegram Serhii Lysak said further analysis had confirmed that three missing people had been killed in the attack on Friday.Those killed were doctors and employees of the clinic and neighbouring vet clinic.The initial two who were identified as being killed were a 69-year-old man who was passing by the centre and an employee at the vets.1h ago05.44 EDTSouth Africa’s president Cyril Ramaphosa has appointed a panel to investigate US allegations that a Russian ship had collected weapons from a naval base near Cape Town last year, the presidency said in a statement on Sunday.The US ambassador to South Africa Reuben Brigety said on 11 May that he was confident that a Russian ship, which docked at a naval base in Simonstown in the western Cape in December last year, took aboard weapons from South Africa.The South African has since denied it, Reuters reports.The allegations have caused a diplomatic row between the US, South Africa and Russia and called into question South Africa’s non-aligned position on Ukraine conflict.South Africa says it is impartial and has abstained from voting on U.N. resolutions on the war.“The president decided to establish the inquiry because of the seriousness of the allegations, the extent of public interest and the impact of this matter on South Africa’s international relations,” said the statement.2h ago04.53 EDTAuthor Bill Browder, who is on a panel on the BBC One current affairs show, said that the Russian government is “failing miserably”.Browder has written two books about Russia and his experience in finance there, which covers corruption and money laundering.He said: “Corruption inside Russia has hollowed out the military. The supposed strong force failed at every step, they lost hundreds of thousands of soldiers, they lost huge amounts of equipment.“As he said Ukraine is a small country compared to Russia and they are being decimated by this small country.“It is difficult watching that interview because everything he said is a lie. It will be painful when [Ukraine] launch that spring offensive.”He said it is impossible that Putin is popular, as is claimed, when he has to rely on “totalitarian” measures.2h ago04.48 EDTRussia hasn't started to act 'seriously' yet in Ukraine, Russian ambassador saysWhen Kuenssberg mentions war crimes, including a maternity hospital being attacked in Mariupol and asks why Kelin won’t be honest about what has happened, he replies that the war has been going on since 2014 in the Donbas with crimes being committed on the Ukrainian army side.He adds: “We want peace.

He said he had not been treated differently from any other prisoner, and it is the court’s judgement.On the subject of jailed westerners in Russia, Kelin claims that Evan Gerschkovich was arrested as a spy.2h ago04.42 EDTThe Kremlin’s man in London, Andrei Kelin, has spoken to the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg on Sunday morning about the war in Ukraine.He said that Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of Russia’s Wagner group, is a “free man” who is “commenting on what is happening in Bakhmut, and how the battle has gone”.“I don’t think that he is very much wrong because the threat that existed for us on the eve of the military operation … was really the danger that presented to the existence of our state,” he said, in regards to Prigozhin saying Russia’s existence is at threat.Kuenssberg challenged him on this, saying it was untrue. Kelin replied with conjecture about the size of the Ukrainian army.Kelin went on to say that he did not agree with Prigozhin that there was a chance of “losing Russia”.In response to a question about whether the attack on a hospital is justified, he brought up apparent incidents in Luhansk and Donetsk and claimed there had not been any mentions of it in British press.Updated at 05.06 EDT3h ago04.06 EDTAn interesting piece here from the Kyiv Post on President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s speechwriting team and process.Senior correspondent Maryna Shashkova said that Zelenskiy’s team say that speeches are “80%” him.“He always knows what he wants to say, and he immediately formulates it in sentences and phrases. He speaks ready-made thoughts, the speechwriter needs to listen, take notes and possibly add what the president did not say,” a source told the Post.Others involved are Dmytro Lytvyn, a speechwriter, and Yuriy Kostyuk, who worked with Zelenskiy when he was an actor.“The main task of a speechwriter is to completely turn off your ego and become a reflection of another person. They can do it,” an official in the president’s office said.Updated at 04.27 EDT4h ago03.21 EDTA 41-year-old man died during Russia’s mass drone strike on Kyiv on Sunday morning, after being hit by falling debris.The death was confirmed by mayor Vitali Klitschko.

It was not immediately clear how many of the drones were shot over Kyiv.The air force said on Telegram that Russia had targeted military and critical infrastructure facilities in the central regions of Ukraine, and the Kyiv region in particular.Serhiy Popko, the head of Kyiv’s military administration, said earlier that preliminary information indicated the air raid was the largest drone attack since the start of Russia’s invasion in February 2022.He added that Russia used the Iranian-made Shahed drones in the attack. Reuters was not able to independently verify that information.“Today, the enemy decided to ‘congratulate’ the people of Kyiv on Kyiv Day with the help of their deadly UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles),” Popko said on the Telegram messaging app.“The attack was carried out in several waves, and the air alert lasted more than five hours.”President Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged Iran earlier this week to reconsider the supply of deadly drones to Russia in order to stop their slide into “the dark side of history”. But Iran on Saturday said his comments were really designed to attract more arms and financial aid from the west.Updated at 03.24 EDT5h ago02.01 EDTSummaryWelcome back to our live coverage of Russia’s war on Ukraine. This is Christine Kearney and here’s an overview of the latest.Russia carried out a major two-wave overnight air attack on Kyiv that killed at least one person, officials said, calling it the biggest drone attack on the capital yet since the start of the war, as Kyiv prepares to celebrate its birthday on Sunday.The pre-dawn attacks came on the last Sunday of May when the capital celebrates Kyiv Day, the anniversary of its official founding 1,541 years ago. Ukraine says it shot down more than 40 drones.More on that story soon. In other news:
Preliminary operations have begun to pave the way for a counteroffensive against Russian occupying forces, a Ukrainian presidential adviser has said. “It’s a complicated process, which is not a matter of one day or a certain date or a certain hour,” Mykhailo Podolyak said in an interview with the Guardian. “It’s an ongoing process of deoccupation, and certain processes are already happening, like destroying supply lines or blowing up depots behind the lines.
The commander of Ukraine’s armed forces, Gen Valerii Zaluzhnyi, raised expectations that a major operation could be imminent by declaring on social media: “The time has come to take back what’s ours.” Zaluzhny’s declaration on the Telegram messaging app on Saturday was accompanied by a cinematic video showing heavily armed Ukrainian soldiers preparing for battle.
Ukraine’s defence ministry has claimed Russia is planning to simulate a major accident at the occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station to try to thwart Kyiv’s long-planned counteroffensive. The plant, in an area of Russian-occupied southern Ukraine, has been repeatedly hit by shelling that each side blames the other for.
Russian forces have temporarily eased their attacks on the besieged eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut to regroup and strengthen their capabilities, a senior Kyiv official said on Saturday. Russia’s Wagner private army began handing over its positions to regular Russian troops this week after declaring full control of Bakhmut after the longest and bloodiest battle of the war, Reuters reported. In a statement on Telegram, Ukraine’s deputy defence minister, Hanna Maliar, said Russian forces have continued attacking but that “overall offensive activity has decreased”.
Russian forces have intercepted two long-range Storm Shadow cruise missiles supplied to Ukraine by Britain, the RIA news agency cited the defence ministry as saying on Saturday. Reuters reports that the ministry said it had intercepted shorter-range US-built Himars-launched and Harm missiles, and shot down 13 drones in the last 24 hours, RIA reported.
Defeat in its war against Ukraine would leave Russia “vindictive” and “brutal” and posing a threat to Nato countries, the outgoing head of the RAF said. Air Chief Marshal Sir Mike Wigston told the Telegraph that Russia’s air force, surface navy and submarine force are a threat to Britain and Nato. He warned its threat could even get worse if the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, was ousted.
A construction worker has been killed near the Russian village of Plekhovo, a few kilometres from the border with Ukraine after shelling from the Ukrainian side, said Roman Starovoyt, the governor of the Kursk region. Works were being carried out not far from Plekhovo on fortifying defensive lines for the state border, the governor said on Telegram.
Ukraine struck oil pipeline installations deep inside Russia on Saturday with a series of drone attacks including on a station serving the vast Druzhba oil pipeline that sends western Siberian crude to Europe, according to Russian media. Ukrainian drone attacks inside Russia have been growing in intensity in recent weeks, and the New York Times reported that US intelligence believes Ukraine was behind a drone attack on the Kremlin earlier this month.
Ukraine has asked Germany to supply it with Taurus cruise missiles, an air-launched weapon with a range of 500km (310 miles), a spokesperson for the defence ministry in Berlin said on Saturday. Germany received the request several days ago, the spokesperson said, confirming a report by Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. She declined to provide further details or say how likely it was that Germany would supply the missiles to Ukraine.

Photograph: APThe ObserverVaticanThe pope and Emanuela Orlandi: Vatican back in the spotlight over mystery of missing girlShe was 15 when she was last seen alive in Rome. Her brother explains why he backs a new theory featured in a TV showAngela Giuffrida in RomeSun 28 May 2023 03.00 EDTNot long before she disappeared in the summer of 1983, Emanuela Orlandi went to Piazza del Catalone, a small square just outside of the Vatican walls, to meet friends.There was still a party vibe during that sweltering June just a few weeks after AS Roma clinched the Serie A title. In a photograph taken at the time Orlandi, who was then 15, is wearing a headband in yellow and red, the football team’s colours, that her mother had made. It was one of the last photographs taken of the teenager before she vanished without trace on 22 June 1983, an image that has come to define the campaign of her older brother Pietro Orlandi’s unrelenting search for the truth.“Emanuela was always here with friends,” he said in an interview with the Observer in Piazza del Catalone. “They were still celebrating; it was the last photo taken of her smiling.”The disappearance of Emanuela – who has not been seen by her family since leaving her home within Vatican City, where her father was a lay employee in the papal household, for a flute lesson in Rome – has gripped Italy for four decades. But it was only in January this year that the powerful and inscrutable Holy See began its own investigation, with its promoter of justice, Alessandro Diddi, promising to leave no stone unturned in a mystery that has produced many theories, some of them outlandish, but no concrete facts. Prosecutors in Rome began collaborating with the Vatican on the probe this month.“For 40 years there has never been a collaboration between the two,” said Orlandi, who recently caused controversy after insinuating that the much-revered Pope John Paul II might have been involved in his younger sister’s disappearance. “Until a few years ago the Vatican said it knew nothing, that she disappeared in Italy and so it needed to be investigated there. On the other hand, I’m told Rome has lots of documents. For all these years the Vatican has stayed silent – maybe this means someone there has proof of what happened.”Vatican reopens investigation into teenager who went missing in 1983Read moreThe Vatican’s investigation began a few months after the Netflix series, Vatican Girl, brought Emanuela’s case back under the global spotlight. The series explored theories that have emerged over the years, the first one being that she was kidnapped by a gang in order to blackmail the Vatican into releasing Mehmet Ali Ağca, who was jailed in 1981 after trying to assassinate John Paul II. Her disappearance has also been linked to a wave of financial scandals at the Vatican bank, an alleged sex ring run by Vatican police, and the mafia.Another theory was that Emanuela was taken to London, where she lived for years in a youth hostel owned by a Catholic congregation, with her expenses funded by the Vatican. According to this hypothesis, she died in London before her body was transferred back to Rome and buried in the Vatican. In 2019, two tombs in the Vatican were reopened after a tipoff that Emanuela may have been buried there. No human remains were found.But the new, and most startling, claim in the Netflix series came from a childhood friend of Emanuela, who said the teenager had confided in her about being molested by “someone close” to John Paul II.“She said the conversation happened a few days before Emanuela disappeared and that [the alleged incident] took place in the Vatican gardens,” said Orlandi. That Emanuela might have been a victim of paedophilia is probably the most plausible theory, he added. “When you know in that environment they do certain things, maybe she was put in that situation?”Orlandi’s determination to find the truth has irked the Vatican. In April, during questioning with Vatican prosecutors, he shared an audio tape containing an alleged conversation between a journalist and the boss of a Rome criminal organisation suspected of being embroiled in Emanuela’s disappearance. In the recording, the crime boss insinuated that the late John Paul II, whose original name was Karol Józef Wojtyła, would go out at night with senior clergymen in search of teenage girls.Part of the audio was subsequently aired on an Italian TV programme during an interview with Orlandi, in which he added: “They tell me that Wojtyła occasionally went out in the evening with two Polish monsignors, and it certainly wasn’t to bless homes.”Pietro Orlandi has welcomed the Vatican investigation. Photograph: AGF/Universal Images Group/Getty ImagesPope Francis denounced the “offensive and unfounded insinuations” during his Sunday Angelus, while the Vatican’s daily newspaper, L’Osservatore Romano, said the “anonymous, shameful accusations” were “madness”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to This is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pivotal stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I also gave the names of the two monsignors, who were close to John Paul. Everyone knew they would sometimes go out at night together. I simply added that their [outings] were not for religious reasons.”He has also been left wondering if Pope Francis knew anything about his sister’s fate when, shortly after his election in 2013, the pontiff told him that Emanuela was “in heaven”.“He told me these words, I don’t know why,” said Orlandi. “For [Joseph] Ratzinger [his predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI], Emanuela was a taboo. So the fact that Francis used her name made me think he wanted to collaborate with me, but since then he has never wanted to meet again.”Orlandi, who has three other sisters, described a privileged childhood within the Vatican walls, where they enjoyed the gardens and felt as if they were in “the safest place in the world”.His pursuit of the truth is partly influenced by guilt. On the day she disappeared Emanuela had asked him to give her a lift to her flute lesson. “It was so hot in Rome, and I didn’t want to go,” he said. “She was a little angry, and left. I still wonder whether this would have happened if I had taken her.”Time will tell if the investigation will bring the answers he needs. “For all these years we don’t know if Emanuela is alive or dead,” he said. “I will continue my battle to the very end.”TopicsVaticanThe ObserverItalyEuropePope John Paul IIPope Benedict XVIPope FrancisThe papacynewsReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

 Russia-Ukraine war – latest updatesJulian Borger in KyivSat 27 May 2023 08.53 EDTLast modified on Sat 27 May 2023 10.22 EDTPreliminary operations have already begun to pave the way for a counteroffensive against Russian occupying forces, a Ukrainian presidential adviser has said.“It’s a complicated process, which is not a matter of one day or a certain date or a certain hour,” Mykhailo Podolyak said in an interview with the Guardian. “It’s an ongoing process of de-occupation, and certain processes are already happening, like destroying supply lines or blowing up depots behind the lines.“The intensity is increasing, but it will take quite a long period of time,” he added, predicting that as the counteroffensive gathered momentum, there would be more incursions into Russia by Russian rebel groups, such as the raid in Belgorod region earlier this week.On Saturday the commander of Ukraine’s armed forces, Gen Valeriy Zaluzhny, raised expectations that a major operation could be imminent by declaring on social media: “The time has come to take back what’s ours.”Ukrainian troops attach a bomb to a drone in the suburbs of Donetsk. Photograph: Efrem Lukatsky/APZaluzhny’s declaration on the Telegram messaging app was accompanied by a cinematic video showing heavily armed Ukrainian soldiers preparing for battle to a soundtrack of ominous music and a narrator reciting a prayer calling for strength to “annihilate” Ukraine’s enemies.The secretary of the national security and defence council, Oleksiy Danilov, told the BBC the much-anticipated counteroffensive could come “tomorrow, the day after tomorrow or in a week”.Danilov said Kyiv had “no right to make a mistake” on the decision because it was a historic opportunity that “we cannot lose”.A long spell of dry weather has driven anticipation of the counteroffensive, as has the incursion by Ukrainian-backed Russian rebel groups into Belgorod, possibly intended to draw troops and equipment away from the frontline in Ukraine.Podolyak denied the Russian groups – the Russian Volunteer Corps and the Freedom of Russia Legion – which include far-right extremists in their ranks, were acting on Kyiv’s orders. He said their contracts as part of Ukraine’s foreign legion had ended and they therefore had the status of “citizens of the Russian Federation temporarily on the territory of Ukraine”.But he said Kyiv had not acted to stop the incursion as “we deeply sympathise with whatever protest movements are in Russia”.“As an authoritarian regime exists in Russia, how can we prevent its own citizens from doing something about it?” he asked.A Ukrainian officer prepares to fire in a German self-propelled Panzerhaubitze 2000 artillery unit. Photograph: Efrem Lukatsky/AP“The further Ukraine goes towards liberating its territory, the more such incidents we see within Russian Federation territory,” Podolyak predicted. “It’s an objective consequence of high-intensity war that will demonstrate that Russia cannot carry out the military action in Ukraine, and protect its own borders.“Since Russia has already lost its conventional war, the consequences of this loss will gradually move into Russian territory, and the federal government will eventually lose control over its territory.”The prayer that can be heard on the video posted by Zaluzhny, calls for divine blessing on Ukrainian vengeance.“I go to annihilate the enemies of the motherland, the murderers of my brothers, the rapists of my sisters,” it says as the video shows Ukrainian soldiers standing to attention in battle gear, climbing on to Leopard tanks, and waiting with guns at the ready in a forest.“Let my hand be firm to kill the enemies. Let my eye be clear to kill the enemies. Let my weapon be trustworthy to kill the enemies. Let my will be steel to kill the enemies.”“God, our heavenly father,” the prayer concludes, “bless our decisive offensive, our sacred revenge, our holy victory.”TopicsUkraineThe ObserverRussiaEuropenewsReuse this contentMore on this storyMore on this storyLiveRussia-Ukraine war live: ‘We have enormous resources and haven’t started yet to act very seriously,’ says Kremlin ambassador to UK20m agoRussia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 459 of the invasion10h agoWar has shown Ukrainians – and the rest of us – why museums are so important for telling our stories1d agoRussian attack on outpatient clinic in Dnipro kills two people2d agoMeet Diia: the Ukrainian app used to do taxes … and report Russian soldiers2d agoRussian weapons manufacturers hosted at Saudi trade event2d agoUS imposes sanctions on leader of Wagner group in Mali3d agoRussia moving nuclear warheads to Belarus, says dictator Lukashenko3d agoMost viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Russia-Ukraine war – latest coverage
Julian Borger in KyivSat 27 May 2023 22.37 EDTLast modified on Sun 28 May 2023 06.30 EDTRussia unleashed the biggest drone attack against Kyiv of the war so far overnight as the city prepared to mark the annual celebration of its founding. However, according to Ukrainian military officials, almost all the Iranian-made aircraft were shot down.The air force said it shot down 52 out of 54 Shahed drones launched against the city in successive waves, but falling debris still killed one man, injured two people, and set ablaze the roof of a shopping centre.The attack appeared to come from the north and south and at low altitudes. A spokesperson from Operational Command South said the Russians appeared to seeking ways of evading Ukrainian’s steadily improving air defences.“The enemy traditionally used the eastern coast of the Azov Sea to attack, but the routes of these aircraft were somewhat unconventional,” the spokesperson told reporters. “They tried to bypass southern air defences as much as possible … They mostly flew over the temporarily occupied territories and dispersed across Ukraine.“They are trying to gravitate towards riverbeds to hide the direction of movement of the Shahed groups,” she added. “We continue to study new approaches in tactics to be as effective as possible.”The drone attacks came in the early hours of Kyiv Day, the annual celebration of the city’s founding 1,541 years ago, marked by street fairs and live concerts.Russia says military drone attempted to strike gas facility near MoscowRead more“The history of Ukraine is a longstanding irritant for the insecure Russians,” Andriy Yermak, the head of Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s office, said on his Telegram channel.Serhiy Popko, the head of the capital’s military administration, said on the Telegram messaging app: “Today, the enemy decided to ‘congratulate’ the people of Kyiv on Kyiv Day with the help of their deadly UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles).“The attack was carried out in several waves, and the air alert lasted more than five hours.”In some parts of the city, local residents, inured to Russian air raids, stood on their balconies, shouting slogans praising Ukrainian air defences and defying Vladimir Putin and Russia.Military observers have suggested that another goal of the constant stream of Russian air attacks is to exhaust Ukrainian air defence ammunition using cheap Iranian drones. Ukrainian officials have told western capitals that a shortage of anti-aircraft missiles is one of their most pressing concerns, ahead of a planned spring counteroffensive against Russian occupying forces.TopicsUkraineEuropeRussianewsReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

It sits adjacent to the old circular parliament building which was constructed in 1927 during the colonial era, which will now be converted into a museum.The building was inaugurated by Modi on Sunday morning, who, dressed in traditional attire, took part in several prayer rituals.“May this iconic building be a cradle of empowerment,” said Modi in a tweet after the ceremony. “May it propel our great nation to new heights of progress.”Modi’s plan to rebuild India’s parliament draws fierce criticismRead moreHundreds of members of the opposition parties were conspicuous by their absence. Earlier in the week, they had come together to announce a boycott of the ceremony, arguing it should be the country’s president, who is largely a ceremonial figure, not Modi who inaugurated the parliament building, calling it a violation on the constitution and parliamentary procedure.In an open letter, opposition groups described Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government as “authoritarian” and said Modi’s decision “to inaugurate the Parliament building by himself, completely sidelining president Murmu, is not only a grave insult but a direct assault on our democracy … When the soul of democracy has been sucked out [of] Parliament, we find no value in a new building.”The BJP hit back, calling on opposition parties not to “politicise” the ceremony.Indian prime minister Narendra Modi carries a royal golden sceptre to be installed near the chair of the speaker during the inaugural ceremony of the new parliament building, in New Delhi Photograph: APSpeaking after Sunday’s ceremony took place, Supriya Sule, an MP from Congress, the largest opposition party, questioned how the government could go ahead without opposition participation.“To open a new parliament building without the opposition makes it an incomplete event,” she said. “It means there is no democracy in the country”.The new parliament project had attracted controversy from the start, with the Modi government accused of rebuilding the nation’s corridors of power in its own image as part of their nationalistic political agenda. Launching the project in 2020, Modi had said the new parliament building would “become a witness to the creation of a self-reliant India”.The overall development, known as the Central Vista project, cost over $2.4bn and involved building a new government secretariat and a new prime minister’s residence and office. It was accused of a lack of transparency after it was awarded to architect Bimal Patel, who is from Modi’s home state of Gujarat and has been granted some of the most high profile government projects in recent years.But the government and the project’s architects had argued that the old building, which is almost 100 years old, was no longer fit for purpose and could not be adapted.The new complex is three times larger than the old one and has room to seat over 1200 MPs, over 500 more than the original parliament. Though India currently has 800 representatives across the upper and lower house, the numbers are up for review in 2026. Given the increase in India’s population to 1.4 billion people, the number of MPs could be raised.According to the architect, materials and designs had been brought in from all over India to reflect the country’s cultural diversity and different architectural styles, including marble from Rajasthan and teak from Maharastra.A sacred Sengol, a gold sceptre from the southern state of Tamil Nadu which had been received by India’s first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru on independence in 1947, was also placed by Modi in the new parliament chamber.TopicsIndiaNarendra ModiDelhinewsReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Interspersed with soft rock soundtracking footage of the campaign trail are speeches where he promises to deport the roughly four million refugees currently in Turkey.“You brought more than 10 million refugees in,” he shouts, addressing President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, over footage of young people climbing through barbed wire and through dusty tracks next to grassland. “I hereby declare that I will send all refugees back as soon as I come to power.”Campaigners from Kılıçdaroğlu’s Republican People’s party (CHP) hand out Turkish flags and leaflets bearing his campaign promises, including a flyer bearing the words “refugees will return home”, showing a figure scaling a wire fence at sunset.CHP voter Çisel Onat tapped her foot to the music as she watched. “We have to do this, unfortunately,” she said of the promises to expel refugees. “I’m the kind of person who thinks everyone should just live in their own country in suitable conditions.”While Kılıçdaroğlu and his party have branded themselves as democratic challengers to Erdoğan, their campaign before the second-round poll has focused on an anti-immigrant message in a bid to attract votes.Campaign posters for the presidential candidates, the leader of the opposition Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu (left), and President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan Photograph: Umit Turhan Coskun/NurPhoto/ShutterstockAsked about Kılıçdaroğlu’s newfound alliance with ultranationalist Ümit Özdağ, the head of the aggressively anti-refugee Victory party, Onat grimaced.“I find his rhetoric quite harsh, not just about refugees but also about Kurds,” she said. “But we don’t have the luxury of saying no to compromise now. We need to be united.”In the first round of the elections, Kılıçdaroğlu disappointed opposition supporters when he attained 44.5% of the vote behind Erdoğan’s 49.5%. Sinan Oğan, the Victory party’s presidential candidate, gained roughly 5%. A coalition between Erdoğan’s Justice and Development party (AKP) and three nationalist parties surpassed expectations and won a majority in the parliament, part of an old alliance between Erdoğan and hard-right political elements that brought nationalist elements into the ruling coalition, even as Turkey welcomed millions of refugees from Syria.The campaign before Sunday’s runoff vote saw both Erdoğan and Kılıçdaroğlu courting hardcore nationalist voters in an election where growing numbers looking to show their discontent with two decades of Erdoğan’s rule have aligned themselves with ultranationalist, anti-refugee elements in Turkish politics.When polled, a large majority of voters say the country’s harsh economic crisis is their main concern, but surging far-right elements have scapegoated immigrants, harnessing anti-refugee sentiment across the country and trumpeting racist discourse on immigration in a way that has been taken up by the mainstream and appears set to stay long after the election ends.Rather than provide alternatives, both presidential candidates have sought to harness support from the ultranationalist right – with both gaining the support of one of the two leading figures in the Victory party. A week after the first-round vote, Oğan said he was backing Erdoğan. Days later, Özdağ declared an alliance with a smiling Kılıçdaroğlu at a press conference. The Victory party leader said he had backed the opposition leader because he believed Kılıçdaroğlu was more likely to enact his policy of immediately deporting refugees.Refugee numbers“It’s one thing to add tough rhetoric on refugees, it’s another to shake hands with Özdağ,” said analyst Selim Koru of the Foreign Policy Research Institute. “This changes the entire chemistry of the opposition coalition to something different from what it was before the first round.”While the CHP leader’s campaign previously pushed a message of social inclusion, tolerance for religious minorities and Kurds, and often showed him making his signature gesture, a heart symbol with his hands, his campaign before the runoff has pivoted firmly to the right in a desperate bid to find the millions of votes he needs to challenge Erdoğan.Kılıçdaroğlu, the leader of a historically socially democratic party, has doubled down on pledges to deport all refugees within a year of coming to power and hardened his rhetoric, including releasing campaign material falsely inflating the number of Syrian and Afghan refugees in Turkey by several million. A recent video splices footage of burning cars with a man shouting that immigrants must leave immediately, before showing a menacing figure following a woman as she walks home at night.Turkey’s opposition, primarily composed of the CHP along with their nationalist coalition partners the Iyi party, have sought to oppose Erdoğan by challenging his decision to grant temporary protection status to about 3.6 million Syrians, as well as making a deal with the EU that granted Turkey €6bn (£5.2bn) in support in return for preventing migration into the bloc.Under Erdoğan, Turkish authorities have cracked down on migration flows from Afghanistan and Syria while recently seeking to mend relations with Damascus, prompting Erdoğan to say he believes Syrians are safe to return. Last October, Human Rights Watch reported that hundreds of Syrian men and boys were arbitrarily detained, beaten and deported, and in some cases forced to cross the border with Syria at gunpoint. Syrians and refugees have also been the target of violent attacks that often go unpunished.Yet a harsh stance on refugees found willing ears among many of the CHP’s younger supporters. Earlier this week, a leading member of the party’s youth wing posted a video to Twitter under the words: “Syrians will leave,” showing a figure in a hoodie spray-painting the same words on to a wall next to Kılıçdaroğlu’s name.Turkish poll“I don’t consider this racist,” said Melis, 23, standing on the dockside in Kadiköy as she discussed Kılıçdaroğlu’s pledges to deport refugees. A fervent supporter of Kılıçdaroğlu, she was eager to voice her belief that Syrians have benefited disproportionately from Erdoğan’s rule, a common talking point with the opposition, if untrue.Melis was also unconcerned by Kılıçdaroğlu’s recent alliance with Özdağ. “It fits with his previous remarks and policies,” she said.Few opposition supporters questioned the benefits of Kılıçdaroğlu’s rightwing shift, despite a majority of Victory party voters telling pollsters they would vote for Erdoğan, and Kılıçdaroğlu previously relying on Kurdish votes, a group traditionally opposed by nationalists.In his corner shop, Bilal Yuksel said he’d voted for the Victory party’s Oğan in the first round, as part of his commitment to protest voting.Yuksel said he was angered by high inflation and the slow response to deadly earthquakes that killed more than 50,000 earlier this year, and was voting to oppose the government on these issues as well as immigration.“The reason I’m voting for Kılıçdaroğlu is that I don’t like the other side, I don’t want them in power. But I don’t believe he’ll keep his promises to deport refugees,” he said.TopicsTurkeyThe ObserverRecep Tayyip ErdoğanRefugeesnewsReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Photograph: Jordi Matas / The Guardian / Family of Elvira MoralElvira and her brothers, Ricard and Ramón, were left at a train station in Barcelona aged two, four and five. As an adult, when Elvira decided to look for her parents, she discovered a family history wilder than anything she had imaginedby Giles TremlettTue 28 Mar 2023 01.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 6 Apr 2023 06.45 EDTOn 22 April 1984, a sandy-haired, ringleted two-year-old girl named Elvira was driven with her brothers, Ricard and Ramón, aged four and five, to a grand railway terminus in Barcelona. The children, dressed in designer clothes, rode in a white Mercedes-Benz driven by their father’s French friend Denis. He parked near the modernist Estación de Francia (now known as Estació de França) and walked them into the hangar-like hall, which had shiny, patterned marble floors and was topped by two glass domes. Once there, he told the children to wait while he bought sweets.The three siblings waited, but Denis did not return. Eventually, Elvira started crying. A railway worker asked what was wrong and Ramón, who spoke French and Spanish, explained. The police were called, but when they asked the children their parents’ names, they did not know. Nor could the children give their own surnames, or say where they lived – except that, until recently, it had been Paris.Five-year-olds usually know such basic things, but the police were not overly concerned. Children are not generally abandoned without explanation, especially in groups of three. Authorities expected that very soon, someone – a relative, friend or schoolteacher – would report them missing and the mystery would be solved. They made no attempt to alert the press or appeal to the public for help.That evening, police took them to an orphanage in Barcelona. Three days later, they were moved to a care home for vulnerable children in the centre of the city. The mid-1980s was an age of faxes, telegrams and hand-delivered mail, so international communication was slow, but police in France and across Europe were now informed of the three missing children in Barcelona.Days turned into weeks, but no one came looking. Care home staff noticed that when the conversation turned to their parents or the past, the well-behaved children either had nothing to say or walked away. According to one of their reports, staff decided not to push back against what they saw as “a psychological block”.A few weeks later, in May, an educational psychologist named Marisa Manera saw a photograph of Elvira and her brothers pinned to a board in a district office of Barcelona’s social services. “We are seeking information on these three children,” read an accompanying note. A business card with the care home’s number was pinned to it. Marisa and her husband, a teacher named Lluís Moral, had fostered children before, and they offered the three siblings a temporary home. The children moved in at the end of June.That summer, the five of them went on a camping trip, staying on the sandy delta of the River Ebro, 120 miles south of Barcelona. The children did not know their father’s name, but they remembered his spectacular cars: a black Porsche, a grey-green Jaguar and another white Mercedes-Benz. When, during that holiday, they saw a white Mercedes, two-year-old Elvira pointed and said: “Look, papa’s car!” as if her parents had arrived.Months became years. In 1986, Marisa and Lluís formally adopted Elvira and her brothers, giving them the surnames Moral Manera (Spaniards receive one from each parent). “They got the three-kid family they had always wanted,” Elvira, now a slender 41-year-old woman with dark eyes, dyed silver hair and a chevron tattoo on one knuckle, told me. This was shared good fortune, since the children enjoyed a happy, loving childhood. “We won the jackpot,” as Elvira put it. The siblings became a tight gang, living a middle-class existence in an apartment overlooking a greyhound track in Barcelona.Growing up, Elvira sometimes puzzled over why her biological parents abandoned them, but it did not weigh on her. The adoption was never a taboo subject. Occasionally, Elvira imagined her parents ringing the doorbell and greeting her with a breezy “Bonjour!” Sometimes, at the end of nights out partying as teenagers or young adults, Elvira would ask her brothers to revisit memories of their previous life. The few they had were located in Paris and the French countryside, or on journeys to snowy Switzerland or Belgium. They involved road trips in their father’s cars, a jumble of places and a grandmother figure dressed in black who forced them to drink milk when they stayed with her. But although Elvira liked to hear about their early childhood, she had no desire to search for her biological parents.As an adult, Elvira learned sign language and began teaching children with hearing difficulties. She was following in the footsteps of Lluís, who had taught children with special educational needs. (Lluís died before Elvira’s 18th birthday.) She held firm to a conviction that when it comes to the way character is formed, nurture overwhelmingly trumps nature.Ramón and Ricard. Photograph: Jordi Matas/The Guardian/Family of Elvira MoralIn 2014, Elvira had a son with her partner, Marco, an Italian eyeglasses designer based in Barcelona. During her pregnancy, as her body changed, Elvira started to feel unsettled by how little she knew about her biological family. What if her parents had some sort of hereditary disease? After her son was born, her curiosity increased – and increased further with the birth of a second son in 2017. (That same year, Elvira and Marco married and bought a flat a few minutes from where Elvira had grown up.) Looking down at a breastfeeding child, Elvira wondered whether her mother had breastfed her, and what other rituals they had shared during the brief time they had together. Elvira’s sons were so obviously, heart-wrenchingly precious to her that she imagined only a life-shattering event could have driven her mother to abandon her children. As Elvira’s sons grew older, she realised something else was seriously amiss. “What five-year-old can’t name their parents?” she asked herself.In December 2020, she gave herself a MyHeritage DNA test as a Christmas present. She hoped the company’s vast DNA database might turn up a blood relative. To her surprise, it found only a small number of matches in France, and many more in southern Spain. “That was a shock. We were convinced we were French,” she told me. But the results were vague. At best, they showed just 1 or 2% of shared DNA with others on the database, and those Elvira contacted either ignored her or had no information to offer. “That’s it. We’ll never find them,” she thought. Even so, she wasn’t ready to give up. Her quest had begun.Elvira told her brothers and Marisa that she had started to try to trace her birth family. Two days later, Marisa called Elvira and Ramón to her apartment for a family meeting. (Ricard was not in Barcelona.) She had something to show them: a few faded newspaper cuttings that she had filed away in July 1984, shortly after the children moved in.The articles were about a Frenchman called Raymond Vaccarizzi. He was a mafia boss from Lyon who moved to the Spanish coastal village of L’Escala, 85 miles north of Barcelona, in the early 1980s, as gang wars escalated and French police closed in on him. Vaccarizzi ran a prostitution ring and protection rackets, and he was notoriously violent. Late in 1983, he was arrested for murder and sent to La Modelo, a 19th-century stone and brick Barcelona jail squeezed into a densely populated residential district. From the upper gallery of one wing, inmates regularly held shouted conversations with friends and family down in the street.On 14 July 1984, Vaccarizzi arranged to talk from the gallery with his wife, Antoinette, a French former sex worker. As he shouted down through the window grilles, a man with a rifle, positioned on the roof of a six-storey apartment block across the street, took aim. Two-high velocity rounds struck Vaccarizzi’s head. It was a spectacular and highly professional hit, widely covered in the local press. Rumours circulated that the sniper had dressed as a priest, or used an elephant gun, or been trained by an elite French army unit. Nobody wept at Vaccarizzi’s death. Nicknamed “the Devil”, he had personally meted out vicious beatings and murdered three rivals. After his death, his wife disappeared from Spain. Their teenage son, abandoned in L’Escala, was taken in by a rival mafia family.Marisa explained to Elvira and Ramón why she had kept the newspaper cuttings all these years. Vaccarizzi was French and shared a first name (or its French version) with Ramón. Some stories the children told – of fast cars and sudden trips – suggested that their parents might have been involved in crime. “Our theory was that you might be his children,” she told them.Elvira Moral at home in Barcelona. Photograph: Jordi Matas/The Guardian/Family of Elvira Moral“That blew my mind,” Elvira told me, remembering seeing the Vaccarizzi cuttings for the first time. “But anything seemed possible.” When I visited Marisa, a small, neat 74-year-old woman with short, coppery hair, at the apartment where she raised the children – and where her three grandchildren were enjoying an afternoon hangout – she told me that they had even worried that gangsters might be secretly tracking the children.But Ramón, who is now 44 and lives near Elvira with his partner and infant daughter, dismissed the Vaccarizzi theory. He retained a clear image of their father as a man with “the air of a winner” and whitish hair. As a child, Ramón had once startled the family by blurting out that a pale-haired man on their television “looks just like our father”. The dark-haired Vaccarizzi was very different. Although 38 years had passed, everyone accepted Ramón’s judgment. His memories were Elvira’s main source of clues.Apart from the cuttings and Ramón’s memories, all Elvira had were the brief official papers registering her abandonment, in which doctors and carers describe her as a normal, healthy two-year-old whose only oddity was a desire to sleep lying crosswise in her bed. These documents created further confusion about whether their origins lay in France or Spain – with Ricard’s name appearing first as Richard (in French) and in later documents as both Ricardo (Spanish) and Ricard (Catalan). The official papers said the children and their father had lived with Denis, Denis’s wife and their children before being abandoned. They had not seen their mother for a while and told care workers that their father had claimed she “no longer loved them”.Even though the siblings agreed that Vaccarizzi could not have been their father, Marisa’s instincts that the children’s biological parents may have been connected to the criminal underworld seemed plausible, fitting with some of the children’s other memories. When I visited Ramón in a small penthouse apartment in Barcelona, he recalled once finding a pistol in a house where they were staying. He and Ricard started playing with it on an outdoor staircase. Ramón pointed the pistol at his brother, then turned away and pulled the trigger. The gun recoiled as he fired a real bullet. He explained with photographic exactitude the shape of the staircase, the white outside wall and a garden below. “My father was furious,” he told me.Elvira Moral. Photograph: Jordi Matas/The Guardian/Family of Elvira MoralHe remembers, too, his father driving them to a beachside restaurant and leaving the engine running while he went inside. They waited a few minutes before he reappeared, bleeding from a badly beaten face. “I recall the tension in the car as we drove off,” Ramón said. Ricard’s memories are fewer, but also vivid: his father parking the black Porsche above a vertiginous cliff; a wood-lined Paris apartment with a view of the Eiffel Tower; visiting his father in a hospital room. They seemed like scenes from a French noir gangster movie.Her brothers’ memories, pointing as they did towards her parents’ involvement in illicit activities, started to make Elvira nervous. How do you peer into a world so far removed from your own stable, unremarkable middle-class existence? Despite her nervousness, she discussed with Ramón using hypnosis to dig deeper into his memory. But when she consulted psychologists, they told her that hypnosis might produce false memories or kill off real ones. Elvira felt as if she had hit a dead end, a feeling that would return repeatedly over the coming months as she continued her search.In March 2021, a friend put Elvira in contact with Catalan radio station, RAC-1, and she recorded an interview for an early-evening talkshow, Islàndia. Afterwards, she felt abashed and remorseful. Who would want to listen to her story? Did she really want strangers to know? She asked the show to drop the segment, but they reassured her and sent a digital copy. “I couldn’t even listen to it,” she told me. Nor did she turn on the radio when, at 7pm on 21 March 2021, the broadcast began.On air, Elvira told her story straight. She explained the darker theories about her father’s criminal past and asked for help. Even though Ramón was now involved, she felt lost and alone. “I don’t know what to do,” she said. Elvira insisted she was not angry with her birth parents. Rather, she felt sad for them and wanted to uncover the mysterious tragedy that, she suspected, had made them abandon their children.She did not realise that more than 150,000 people in Catalonia listen to Islàndia. While the interview was still playing, her phone started pinging crazily. People from her past, her work and seemingly everywhere messaged her to express amazement, or ask why she had never told them. Others offered help. She felt overwhelmed and exposed. (Marisa told me she, too, was inundated by calls from friends who were listening. Her blood pressure shot up, requiring an urgent visit to the doctor.)Many people in Barcelona know the Estación de Francia, where Elvira and her brothers were abandoned. Listeners were touched by the image of the three young children left alone in its cavernous hall, and they wanted to help. In the weeks that followed the broadcast, Elvira’s private quest became crowd-sourced. Volunteers set up a Facebook page in Spanish and French, which attracted amateur sleuths and genealogists. Tips poured in. People approached Elvira with wild theories and false leads. (A former French prison officer, for example, claimed to have stopped off at a bar with her father to drink champagne during his transfer between Parisian jails.) Yet Elvira’s story was already so dramatic that even the most bizarre theories seemed possible. Again and again, her hopes were raised and then dashed.It was a frantic, difficult period for Elvira. Since it was hard to judge who was trustworthy and who was not, she came to rely on a new friend, Montse Del Río, a 51-year-old forensic doctor who had heard her story on the radio. Del Río had experience as a volunteer tracking down relatives of newly discovered victims of death squads from the Spanish civil war. Elvira’s story struck a chord with her, and she became a tireless ally and adviser, travelling with Elvira to quiz relatives and reassuring her when she felt frustrated or let down. “She always tells me this is a long journey,” said Elvira.Another volunteer, a French-speaking 54-year-old amateur criminologist called Carmen Pastor, made the first breakthrough two months after the radio broadcast, in May 2021. Elvira’s was her first missing persons case (there have been more since), and it consumed her for up to 14 hours a day. She asked Elvira for the DNA results, doggedly chasing down distant matches and their relatives. Eventually, a distant relative of a woman who showed a 1.4% match to Elvira, and shares great-great-grandparents with her, told Carmen that the story of the three missing children sounded familiar. The woman promised to find out more from some of her relatives and get back to her.On 15 May, Carmen called Elvira with news. It was early in the morning, and Elvira was celebrating a friend’s 40th birthday at a house in the country. “I think we’ve found [some of] your family,” Elvira recalls Carmen saying. Carmen was waiting for a final call that would confirm it, she said. Elvira remembers this day as one of the tensest of her life. “I’m in shock,” she messaged Carmen. “Can it really be them?” Carmen herself spent the day nailing down details. “It was a heart attack day for me, emotionally charged, full of nerves,” she told me.By the evening, Carmen had the information she needed. “I’ve just spoken to your second cousin. She explained that there were three missing children, and that the eldest was called Ramón,” Elvira remembers Carmen telling her on the phone. If the tip was correct, her father was also called Ramón and her mother Rosario. They were Spaniards, from Seville and Madrid respectively. Elvira found it hard to trust this information fully – she had, after all, always thought her parents were French.That night Elvira received a call from a potential second cousin called Lorena. If she and Elvira were truly related, Lorena said, there were many more cousins, aunts and uncles who wanted to meet her. Could she do a video call with some of them? Elvira burst into tears. She called Ramón and told him to prepare for a video chat. (She could not make contact with Ricard, who leads an alternative lifestyle in the Catalan countryside and shuns mobile phones.) Night had fallen when Elvira stared into her phone screen at a potential first cousin called Mari, who was sitting with her mother, Felisa, a potential maternal aunt. They were 380 miles away, living in a working-class Madrid suburb, and belonged to a once-itinerant and marginalised tinker group called the mercheros.The conversation was dizzying. As Elvira struggled for something concrete to hold on to, Mari placed photographs in front of the camera. Soon Elvira was staring at herself as a baby and her brothers as small children. Then a photograph of an elderly woman was held up. “That’s the old lady with the milk!” exclaimed Ramón. It was their grandmother Inés, who had died in 2013. Most striking were the man and woman who, in other photos, pushed them in prams, cuddled them, threw them in the air, fed them, and sat with them on balconies and beaches, and in parks and cars, including in the grey-green Jaguar the boys had remembered. For the first time since she was a toddler, Elvira was looking at her parents.Their names were Ramón Martos Sánchez and Rosario Cuetos Cruz. Ramón was elegant, with a broad smile and a thick shock of greying hair swept backwards. Rosario was a striking, dark-haired woman, with long hair parted down the centre and strong, evenly sculpted features. They had been 34 and 35 when the children were abandoned.On the call, there were tears, warmth and joy. Elvira and Ramón agreed to come to Madrid with Ricard the following weekend to meet their new family. They had solved the first part of the mystery: they knew who their biological parents were. The next question was clear: where were they now?Elvira had hoped her new relatives might know, but they, like her, had no clue. Nobody had heard from them since 1983.The day after the video call with Madrid, Elvira spoke for the first time to relatives of her father in Seville. Her father had been one of seven siblings, only one of whom was still alive: Elvira’s aunt Luisa. She was old and very sick, and she died before Elvira could meet her, just two days after discovering that her nephews and niece had been found. “She was the matriarch. She could have told us so much,” Elvira said.The next weekend, Elvira and her brothers went to meet her mother’s family in Madrid. During the visit, and in conversations with the Seville family, Elvira assembled some of the puzzle pieces of her past. Her father, like one of his brothers, had become a burglar. (Elvira later found their mugshots in a newspaper, after their arrest in 1973.) In 1978, he fled to France with Rosario after a police shootout. At first, Ramón and Rosario stayed with some of his relatives in Paris, but after Rosario argued with them, the couple moved into their own place. Nobody could recall their address.Ramón Martos Sánchez, Elvira’s biological father. Photograph: Jordi Matas/The Guardian/Family of Elvira MoralElvira’s new relatives remembered her father, Ramón, as clever, charming, fun-loving. His extrovert Seville family said he grew up in an atmosphere immortalised by a film genre called “cine quinqui” in which young 1970s chancers battle poverty, only to end up dead, in jail, or addicted to heroin. In France, Elvira’s father climbed to a higher rank of criminality, apparently dealing in counterfeit money, jewels and other high-end, high-risk goods. The early 80s was a period of spectacular bank heists in Paris, and it didn’t seem impossible that Elvira’s father had been involved in some of them. Her brothers had memories of a box filled with glittering precious stones, a jar of coins and their father boasting their home was like the Fábrica de la Moneda y Timbre, Spain’s national mint.Elvira’s biological parents’ first attempts at having children failed. A soothsayer told Rosario not to worry, that babies would come, and they would come in a rush. In France, she duly gave birth three times in three-and-a-half years. Relatives were adamant that Rosario had loved Ramón, Ricard and Elvira intensely. She and her husband kept up constant contact with relatives in Spain, through letters, postcards, photographs and phone calls, and the children were occasionally sent to Madrid to stay with grandmother Inés. But in May 1983, almost a year before the children were abandoned, communication with both sides of the family stopped. Occasionally, a French woman called Madrid, shouting “Rosario” and “Ramón” down the line, but nobody spoke French and the calls dried up. The families considered reporting them missing, but they didn’t trust the police. What if Ramón and Rosario, and their children, were running from the law? The Madrid family consulted another soothsayer, who said the children were OK but the parents were in “a dark place”.When I met Elvira’s new aunt Felisa for a coffee in Madrid recently, she was delighted to have found her niece and nephews, but bemused about what had happened to her sister Rosario. During their final phone conversation in May 1983, Rosario, who used to ring her sister from French pay phones, had explained that Ramón Sr was very ill, which matches reports from other relatives who told Elvira he spent time in a tuberculosis clinic near Paris. For a long time, Felisa had worried that he might have died, sparking a wider tragedy that engulfed Rosario and their children. “I thought maybe she lost her mind as a result,” Felisa said.For decades, Elvira had felt comfortable as an adopted child. Yet, she told me, there had always been a part of her that had questions. “Was I older or younger than I thought? Even something as silly as: what is my real zodiac sign?” In the absence of birth certificates, the children’s ages had been estimated, and their births registered in Spain on the closest saint’s day – 25 January 1982 for Saint Elvira. But with their parents’ names now known, volunteer genealogists in France found Elvira’s birth certificate. She had been born in Paris on 29 December 1981. Elvira was delighted, not least because the siblings planned to visit a tattoo artist together and have the Eiffel Tower inked on their sides. If they had been born elsewhere, that would be a terrible mistake. “I told them don’t worry! We’re from Paris!” The Eiffel Tower was inked in triplicate. The other two birth certificates arrived soon after, confirming all three had been born in Paris, though with different home addresses. Ricard had to add seven months to his age, and Ramón 12 weeks. “Finding out the real date moved me to tears,” Ramón told me.Elvira knows she had a better life with Marisa and Lluís than she could have expected with her birth parents. “I would have grown up differently, developing a different personality and values, if I’d been with them,” she said. Rosario had a dark, hard side to her. Someone had said she rarely laughed. “I think she had a tough life, made harder by being always on the lookout or on the run,” Elvira said. She didn’t see Rosario as one of those stay-at-home mafia wives distanced from their husband’s criminal enterprises. When Elvira imagines finding her parents, she pictures herself talking to her mother. “I’d still like to ask her: what was my birth like for you?” she said. “Other people know those things.”Her father seemed easy-going and popular, but he too had a darker side. His own brother had disowned him because he beat Rosario. He was also a womaniser. Elvira’s brother Ramón recalls playing a game of dare with Ricard, after being left outside a door where their father was ensconced with more than one woman. Which of the boys would be bold enough to knock?Rosario Cuetos Cruz, Elvira’s biological mother. Photograph: Jordi Matas/The Guardian/Family of Elvira MoralElvira’s biological parents were not always easy to admire, according to the codes by which she was raised. “To me, my mother is the person who brought me up,” she said. “But there is also something else important, something genetic, a blood link like I have with my brothers.” She still wanted to know why she and her brothers had been abandoned. The photographs depict a close, happy family. What had gone wrong? Elvira hoped that her parents had been protecting them from a greater danger. Before he disappeared, her father had told a cousin he was close to pulling off a major heist or deal. Had he been out of his depth? Or perhaps he and Rosario had reconciled, seen the danger and fled far away?There were other, more distressing scenarios. Ramón might have killed Rosario. The couple may have been murdered by a rival gang, or died in an accident during a job and been secretly buried. There were many ways her father’s clever, imaginative mind – always looking for the next trick – could have landed him in trouble.Paris was the last place Elvira knew her parents had lived. It seemed the logical place to continue her search. In March 2022 she and Marco spent a weekend there, and I joined them.We had first met in Barcelona a few days earlier, when Elvira told me that some elderly Spanish bar owners in Paris, having been shown photographs of her father by French volunteers, claimed to recognise him. When we met in Paris, she was giddy from talking to them, since they had confirmed that they recognised her father. But when I talked to both bar owners the following day, I left convinced that their memories were false or unreliable. “I might have seen the father on the street yesterday,” shrugged 71-year-old Arturo Sánchez, as we sipped coffee in the wicker chairs of a cafe.Elvira’s curse, I realised, is that people desperately want to help, even when they have nothing to offer. She carried around a photograph taken shortly after they were abandoned, and the three innocent-looking children, staring up at a camera, melted hearts. Her eagerness for answers, and her anxiety about what those answers might reveal, spurred people to offer hope.Elvira and Marco had to fly back to Barcelona before they could visit the address on her birth certificate, in the north of the city. I went to look for it, taking with me a 1982 photograph of Rosario in bell-bottom trousers and a turban-like headscarf, standing in an alleyway with baby Elvira. Local people pointed me to a warren of alleys where bijoux homes now sport security cameras. Ramón had recalled playing in front of a fountain that spurted water out of a wall, round the corner from where they lived. A man sweeping his yard at the end of one alley pointed at a house opposite. “They had a wall fountain in the garden,” he said. “But it has been rebuilt, and the fountain has gone.” The find seemed to confirm Ramón’s laser-like memory. It was exactly where he remembered.Elvira’s eldest brother Ramón as a child. Photograph: Jordi Matas/The Guardian/Family of Elvira MoralIn the absence of other clues, Elvira and Ramón could not shake off the thought that the Catalan beach town of L’Escala, with its past as a hideaway for French gangsters like Vaccarizzi, formed part of their story – even if Vaccarizzi himself did not. Had their father worked with the gangs? Was this where Denis had lived when he took them to Barcelona and dumped them? (They had no other clues about Denis, but Ramón recalls he was very close to his father and suspects that he is the man, dripping in gold chains and bracelets, pictured opposite Ramón senior in photographs from a holiday in Belgium.) Ramón also thought L’Escala was the sort of sunny, Mediterranean seaside place where the childhood pistol incident had happened.In mid-September, I was guided around the town by Jordi Jacas, a local hotel owner. Among the frail, white-haired men and women drinking a late morning aperitif or coffee in the pavement terraces, he pointed out former smugglers, hitmen and call girls. I spoke with, or passed messages on to, four former gangsters, who rang old colleagues now living in Lyon, where many French mobsters had moved. People either did not know, did not remember or did not want to say if they had known Elvira’s father or Denis. Some reactions were indignant, especially if they thought they were being accused of harming three small children.Three weeks later, I returned to L’Escala with Elvira and Ramón to meet the daughter of a former French mafia boss. The siblings wanted to know if their story rang any bells. It didn’t, but the woman felt huge sympathy for Elvira and her brothers. “I know what it’s like to grow up in that kind of family,” she said. Her panicked father had once hurriedly sent her away from L’Escala with her brother after hearing rumours that a rival gang planned to kidnap them. Before we left, Ramón insisted again that the place felt familiar. “It’s the houses,” he said, pointing to the handsome two-storey villas.In late October, I drove Elvira from Seville, where she had been seeing her new family, to Tarifa, Spain’s southernmost point. This is where Elvira’s father’s 90-year-old aunt, Manola, lives, along with one of her adult granddaughters and a small, yappy dog, in part of a converted farmhouse overlooking the strait of Gibraltar, with clear views of the coastline of Morocco, just a dozen miles away. This was Elvira’s first time meeting her great-aunt, and it was a moving encounter. Manola wept as she exclaimed how much Elvira looked like one of her father Ramón’s deceased sisters, and she told tales of his spirited nature and how he once escaped from a police cell. Sometimes the conversation paused as great-aunt and great-niece held hands.“Your mother hit me once,” Manola said suddenly. Elvira had heard about Rosario’s fierce temper and high-handed manner. “I’ve heard her called a bad woman,” she admitted, citing other relatives on her father’s side. When I asked later if she worried that her biological parents were wicked, Elvira was protective. “I’ve asked myself that, but then I look at photos of my father playing with us and think – a real son-of-a-bitch doesn’t do that, rolling around on the grass with the kids.” Good people, she felt, end up doing bad things for many reasons. “You can be a pickpocket, and a wonderful person at the same time.”Elvira’s quest has changed her. Early insecurities have given way to a firm resolve to keep digging. “One thing this has taught me is to be patient,” she told me. “I’m not usually good at waiting.” At the same time, she does wonder if she has sometimes been too caught up in her search. “I’ve got a job, family, friends. You can’t just ignore all that and devote yourself only to this.” She said that one of her own sons, hearing the stories about his mother’s childhood, had begun to fret about abandonment. “I tell him this is something unique that happened to me and won’t happen to him,” she said.At dinner in Seville, the same day we met Manola, I was struck by how well she fitted into this branch of her newly extended family. Rosa-Mari and Ana, two second cousins about the same age as Elvira, with careers as a teacher and a social worker, were there with their children, as was Elvira’s first cousin Manoli, a 55-year-old flamenco dancer. Over the summer, Elvira had holidayed with this family in Seville, taking her children. She had become close with Rosa-Mari, Ana and Manoli, and the four women now occasionally chat together on video calls. Elvira recently told me she was heartbroken to hear that Manoli planned to leave Spain to teach dance in Japan, where flamenco is popular.Ramón Martos Sánchez with Ramón Jr. Photograph: Jordi Matas/The Guardian/Family of Elvira MoralThe sense of ease and connection Elvira experienced as she spent time with her family in Seville suggested to her that, in the battle with nurture, nature was stronger than she had thought. Why had she always liked flamenco, something so alien to Catalan friends and family? Why was Ramón enamoured of any kind of dance with percussive footwork – whether it was tap or the thunderous heel-and-toe of flamenco? “Your father loved flamenco. He always had it on the car radio,” Aunt Felisa had explained.The 600-mile gap separating south-western Seville from north-eastern Barcelona is more than geographical. According to the – often exaggerated – stereotype, Catalans are serious and business-minded while Andalusians are happy-go-lucky, festive and superstitious. Elvira felt at home in her biological father’s outgoing, garrulous, affectionate family, and in Seville, even though she found the lisping Andalusian accent hard to understand. None of this changed her tight relationship with her family in Catalonia, but her new relatives and discovery of her biological roots filled an empty space she had not known existed. “I feel more complete,” she told me.Elvira still longs to know what happened to her birth parents. Ramón Sr and Rosario would now be in their mid-70s. If they were alive, surely they would scour the internet for their children? Elvira knows that the fact that they have never made contact means that they are probably dead – perhaps killed by gangsters skilled at making people disappear. But it doesn’t stop her fantasising that they are out there, she told me.When Elvira was small and asked Marisa about her birth parents, she always received an answer along the lines of: “You are fortunate. You have two mothers, two fathers and two families, in Paris and Barcelona.” If her biological parents ever appeared, Marisa said, they would all get along. It was a good way to calm an anxious child, but it has also turned out to be close to the truth. Elvira really does get along with her biological family. Her horizons have broadened as she has travelled to spend time with them. And since her father had six siblings and her mother had eight, there are cousins Elvira is yet to meet, though money for trips is tight. “I may have to do this little by little while the kids are growing up, and launch myself fully at it afterwards,” she told me.The father who went undercover to find his son’s killersRead moreSome lines of investigation remain to be explored. Attempts to obtain police files about their abandonment and their father’s criminal past have so far failed, though Montse del Rio thinks Elvira will gain access to them soon. And Elvira continues to be buoyed up by the success she has had from crowdsourcing her search, and by the volunteers who have been eager to help. The kindness of strangers, especially of her adoptive parents, has always played a crucial role in her life. The last two years have validated her faith in such kindness, which she hopes may yet help her solve the final riddle of what happened to her parents.When I last saw Elvira, at Marisa’s apartment in early March, she and Ramón were preparing to visit L’Escala again. They planned to speak to more people who lived through the town’s gangster period. “You never know when something is going to drop,” said Elvira. “It’s happened before, and it can happen again.” Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, listen to our podcasts here and sign up to the long read weekly email here.

Preliminary operations have begun to pave the way for a counteroffensive against Russian occupying forces, a Ukrainian presidential adviser has said. “It’s a complicated process, which is not a matter of one day or a certain date or a certain hour,” Mykhailo Podolyak said in an interview with the Guardian. “It’s an ongoing process of deoccupation, and certain processes are already happening, like destroying supply lines or blowing up depots behind the lines.
The commander of Ukraine’s armed forces, Gen Valerii Zaluzhnyi, raised expectations that a major operation could be imminent by declaring on social media: “The time has come to take back what’s ours.” Zaluzhny’s declaration on the Telegram messaging app on Saturday was accompanied by a cinematic video showing heavily armed Ukrainian soldiers preparing for battle.
Explosions shook the Ukrainian capital in early hours on Sunday, Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko said, adding that information was being clarified and defence systems were downing air targets. Klitschko said that at least one person had been killed and more injured in the night raids on Kyiv.
Ukraine’s defence ministry has claimed Russia is planning to simulate a major accident at the occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station to try to thwart Kyiv’s long-planned counteroffensive. The plant, in an area of Russian-occupied southern Ukraine, has been repeatedly hit by shelling that each side blames the other for.
Russian forces have temporarily eased their attacks on the besieged eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut to regroup and strengthen their capabilities, a senior Kyiv official said on Saturday. Russia’s Wagner private army began handing over its positions to regular Russian troops this week after declaring full control of Bakhmut after the longest and bloodiest battle of the war, Reuters reported. In a statement on Telegram, the deputy defence minister, Hanna Maliar, said Russian forces have continued attacking but that “overall offensive activity has decreased”.
Russian forces have intercepted two long-range Storm Shadow cruise missiles supplied to Ukraine by Britain, the RIA news agency cited the defence ministry as saying on Saturday. Reuters reports that the ministry said it had intercepted shorter-range US-built Himars-launched and Harm missiles, and shot down 13 drones in the last 24 hours, RIA reported.
Defeat in its war against Ukraine would leave Russia “vindictive” and “brutal” and posing a threat to Nato countries, the outgoing head of the RAF said. Air Chief Marshal Sir Mike Wigston told The Telegraph that Russia’s air force, surface navy and submarine force are a threat to Britain and Nato. He warned its threat could even get worse if the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, was ousted.
A construction worker has been killed near the Russian village of Plekhovo, a few kilometres from the border with Ukraine after shelling from the Ukrainian side, said Roman Starovoyt, the governor of the Kursk region. Works were being carried out not far from Plekhovo on fortifying defensive lines for the state border, the governor said on Telegram.
Ukraine struck oil pipeline installations deep inside Russia on Saturday with a series of drone attacks including on a station serving the vast Druzhba oil pipeline that sends western Siberian crude to Europe, according to Russian media. Ukrainian drone attacks inside Russia have been growing in intensity in recent weeks, and the New York Times reported that US intelligence believes Ukraine was behind a drone attack on the Kremlin earlier this month.
Ukraine has asked Germany to supply it with Taurus cruise missiles, an air-launched weapon with a range of 500 km (310 miles), a spokesperson for the defence ministry in Berlin said on Saturday. Germany received the request several days ago, the spokesperson said, confirming a report by Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. She declined to provide further details or say how likely it was that Germany would supply the missiles to Ukraine.
Russia has dismissed criticism from the US president, Joe Biden, over Moscow’s plan to deploy tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, saying Washington had for decades deployed just such nuclear weapons in Europe. Russia said on Thursday it was pushing ahead with the first deployment of such weapons outside its borders since the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union, and the Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, said the weapons were already on the move.
Russia is to start expelling German diplomats, teachers and employees of cultural institutions next month. The measure is expected to further exacerbate tensions between the two countries, which have already had very fraught ties since Russia invaded Ukraine early last year.
Russia failed in a bid to prevent Ukraine taking a place on the World Health Organization’s executive board, on a day which also saw North Korea gain a berth. Ten countries joined the board for a three-year term but Russia tried to exclude Ukraine from joining the 34-nation forum at the ongoing World Health Assembly in Geneva.
Russia has accused Japan of “cynical, unscrupulous speculation” over Tokyo’s comments around the nuclear threat Moscow poses and promised to respond to Japan’s latest round of sanctions imposed over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Japan’s chief cabinet secretary, Hirokazu Matsuno, said on Friday that Japan would place additional sanctions on Russia after the G7 summit Tokyo hosted last week agreed to step up measures to punish Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.
Tehran on Saturday accused Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, of anti-Iranian propaganda in his call for Iran to halt the supply of drones to Russia, saying his comments were designed to attract more arms and financial aid from the west. Zelenskiy in a video address on Wednesday called on Iranians to stop their slide into “the dark side of history” by supplying Moscow with drones.

Van Houten posted a video on Instagram showing herself wearing a red poncho, getting drenched from a water cannon.ANP reported that she was arrested and later allowed to return home, but did not specify whether she was among those who will be prosecuted.According to Extinction Rebellion, 7,000 people gathered to join the demonstration.Anticipating the water cannon, some wore swimsuits or carried umbrellas as they sat in protest across the A12 motorway, holding banners and signs.The protest marks the seventh organised by Extinction Rebellion in the same section of motorway at The Hague, close to the parliament and main ministry buildings.But Saturday saw the highest number of people arrested at a protest yet, according to Dutch news agency ANP.“We’re going to stay here until they drag us away,” said postgraduate student Anne Kerevers, 31. Climate change is an unfolding crisis and we know the cause and it’s still being subsidised by our government and it needs to stop,” she told AFP.Police said they had repeatedly “given activists the opportunity to end their action and leave” before using the water cannon and making arrests.“We’ve been coming back every month, or every two months, and every time the number (of protesters) has doubled,” said Aaron Pereira, a spokesperson for Extinction Rebellion.“There is broad popular support for real climate action and people are waking up to the fact that the government is actively going against this by subsidising the fossil fuel industry.”The environmental campaign group, shortened to XR, has become known for its direct action protests against the climate crisis. But in January the group announced it was shifting tactics from disruptions such as smashing windows and glueing themselves to public places in 2023, instead promising to mobilise huge numbers against what it sees as government inaction against global heating.In April it held four days of action in London, including mobilising thousands to rally outside the UK parliament.In recent months it has also rallied at airports across Europe, including protests at Eindhoven airport in the Netherlands in March.This week it joined other groups in demonstrating against Europe’s biggest private jet sales fair in Geneva.Some activists chained themselves to the planes on display, and air traffic was briefly disrupted at the airport due to people on the tarmac.TopicsNetherlandsExtinction RebellionClimate crisisEuropeProtestnewsReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedEnvironmentClimate crisisWildlifeEnergyPollutionGreen lightNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

She has the right to be silent on Healy – but her fans also have the right to judge her for itSat 27 May 2023 09.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 27 May 2023 09.57 EDTTaylor Swift, Matty Healy and a lot of bad bloodWeird coincidence alert! Taylor Swift recently released a collaboration with rapper Ice Spice on a remix of her Midnights track Karma. That’s a big deal for two reasons: 1) Ice Spice is going to be the first Black woman to feature on a Swift song; 2) Matty Healy, the frontman of the band the 1975 and the man that Swift is rumoured to be dating, laughed at some racist jokes about the Bronx rapper on a recent podcast. It’s leading a lot of people to ask: is the Swift/Ice Spice collaboration a calculated attempt at damage control? Is this a cynical PR move? Or is the convenient timing just a fluke?It’s impossible to say for sure. What is clear is that Swift’s army of passionate fans are less than thrilled about the megastar’s rumoured romance with Healy, who has cultivated an “edgelord” persona and always seems to be battling one controversy or another. The Ice Spice episode is in the headlines now because of the connection to Swift, but it actually happened back in January when Healy appeared on a podcast called The Adam Friedland Show and mentioned that he tried to message the rapper on Instagram. The two hosts of the show, Friedland and Nick Mullen – who are famous for starting a podcast called Cum Town which is full of “ironic” bigotry – then had a good little giggle while they called the rapper an “Inuit spice girl”, “a fucking Eskimo or something” and a “chubby Chinese lady” (Ice Spice is Nigerian and Dominican). They also did racist impersonations of various different accents while Healy laughs along. Healy later said he was “kind of a bit sorry” if he upset Ice Spice during the podcast. Which is really very big of the guy.Healy didn’t just laugh along at some offensive jokes once: he has a long history of making problematic statements. It’s possible that some of those statements – such as the time he told the Guardian that he’d never date Swift because it would be “emasculating” – were taken out of context and unfairly interpreted, but many of his “jokes” are extremely hard to excuse. On the same podcast where he mocked Ice Spice, for example, Friedland casually joked about how a friend of Healy’s once walked in on the musician watching porn on Ghetto Gaggers, a porn site that features women of colour being degraded and humiliated. “[It] literally was Ghetto Gaggers on the TV – somebody just getting, like, brutalized,” Healy laughs. Hilarious! They also joked about women’s periods and the moon controlling menstrual cycles. The episode was eventually pulled from Spotify and Apple following backlash.That backlash is now growing and fans are asking Swift to directly address the controversy under the hashtag #SpeakUpNow. “[Healy] has been involved in acts and controversies that deeply trouble us,” one viral open letter tweeted by a fan reads. “While individuals have the right to make their own choices and form relationships, we believe that it is essential for those in the public eye to take a stand against discrimination and hold themselves and their associates accountable.”One the hand, it’s a bit worrying how invested some of Swift’s fans are in her personal life: Healy and Swift, let’s remember, are not officially an item – they’ve just been spotted together a few times. On the other hand, the fans who are demanding that she address Healy’s offensive comments have a point. Swift has never pretended to be an activist and rarely makes any sort of political statement. Nor is she responsible for the past actions of whoever she happens to be seen canoodling in public with. Still, there’s no getting around the fact that Swift is incredibly influential and who she aligns herself with matters. Swift has the right to remain silent on Healy’s past but her fans also have the right to judge her for it.Indiana doctor fined for discussing 10-year-old’s abortionRemember that horrifying story last year about a 10-year-old Ohio girl who was raped and had to leave her state to get a legal abortion? Remember how rightwingers and Republican politicians’ immediate reaction to the story was to yell about it being fake news? When the story was proven to be true, they changed tack and started threatening Dr Caitlin Bernard, the source for the original Indianapolis Star story, with disciplinary action for violating patient privacy laws. This week the Indiana state medical board ruled that Bernard will not lose her license but will have to pay $3,000 in fines and receive a letter of reprimand. It seems clear that Indiana is trying to make an example of Bernard and to stop other healthcare professionals from speaking up about what Bernard described as the “real-world impacts of the laws of this country”.Ex-guard charged with 95 counts of sexual abuse in California women’s prisonAllegations against Gregory Rodriguez date back more than 10 years. “If one officer is getting away with this for more than a decade, he is backed up by other officers and by the system,” Colby Lenz, an advocate with the California Coalition for Women Prisoners, told the Guardian. “This is not just one bad apple.Is Martha Stewart, 81, being on the cover of Sports Illustrated a feminist triumph?Not exactly, says Nancy Jo Sales. “Our sense of whether women continue to be sexually attractive as they age is so heavily influenced by the entertainment, beauty and fashion industries … that I don’t know if we’re always in full possession of our own feelings about it.”Taliban restrictions on women a ‘crime against humanity’In a joint report, Amnesty International and the International Commission of Jurists have said the Taliban’s treatment of women and girls amount to gender persecution, which is defined as a crime against humanity by the international criminal court.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to The Week in PatriarchyFree weekly newsletterReviewing the most important stories on feminism and sexism and those fighting for equalityPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Though many commentators now speak of a “tortured and deadly legacy”, for decades Kissinger was lauded by all quarters of the political and media establishment.A teenage Jewish refugee who fled Nazi Germany, Kissinger charted an unlikely path to some of the most powerful positions on Earth. Even more strangely, as national security adviser and secretary of state under Nixon and Ford, he became something of a pop icon.Back then, one fawning profile of the young statesman cast him as “the sex symbol of the Nixon administration”. In 1969, according to the profile, Kissinger attended a party full of Washington socialites with an envelope marked “Top Secret” tucked under his arm. The other party guests could hardly contain their curiosity, so Kissinger deflected their questions with a quip: the envelope contained his copy of the latest Playboy magazine. (Hugh Hefner apparently found this hilarious and thereafter ensured that the national security adviser got a free subscription.)What the envelope really contained was a draft copy of Nixon’s “silent majority” speech, a now-infamous address that aimed to draw a sharp line between the moral decadence of antiwar liberals and Nixon’s unflinching realpolitik. The actual top-secret work he was doing in the 1970s aged just as poorly. Within a few short years he masterminded illegal bombings in Laos and Cambodia and enabled genocide in East Timor and East Pakistan. Meanwhile, Kissinger was known among Beltway socialites as “the playboy of the western wing”. He liked to be photographed, and photographers obliged. He was a fixture on gossip pages, particularly when his dalliances with famous women spilled into public view – like when he and the actor Jill St John inadvertently set off the alarm at her Hollywood mansion late one night as they stole away to her pool. (“I was teaching her chess,” Kissinger explained later.)While Kissinger gallivanted with Washington’s jet set, he and Nixon – a pair so firmly joined at the hip that Isaiah Berlin christened them “Nixonger” – were busy contriving a political brand rooted in their supposed disdain for the liberal elite, whose effete morality, they claimed, could lead only to paralysis.Kissinger certainly disdained the antiwar movement, disparaging demonstrators as “upper-middle-class college kids” and warning: “The very people who shout ‘Power to the People’ are not going to be the people who take over this country if it turns into a test of strength.” He also scorned women: “To me women are no more than a pastime, a hobby. Nobody devotes too much time to a hobby.” But it’s indisputable that Kissinger held a fondness for the gilded liberalism of high society, the exclusive parties and steak dinners and flashbulbs.High society loved him back. Gloria Steinem, an occasional dining companion, called Kissinger “the only interesting man in the Nixon administration”. The gossip columnist Joyce Haber described him as “worldly, humorous, sophisticated, and a cavalier with women.” The Hef considered him a friend, and once claimed in print that a poll of his models revealed Kissinger to be the man most widely desired for dates at the Playboy mansion.This infatuation didn’t end with the 1970s. When Kissinger turned 90 in 2013, his red-carpet birthday celebration was attended by a bipartisan crowd that included Michael Bloomberg, Roger Ailes, Barbara Walters, even “veteran for peace” John Kerry, along with some 300 other A-listers.An article in Women’s Wear Daily reported that Bill Clinton and John McCain delivered the birthday toasts in a ballroom done up in chinoiserie, to please the night’s guest of honor. (McCain, who spent more than five years as a POW, described his “wonderful affection” for Kissinger, “because of the Vietnam war, which was something that was enormously impactful to both of our lives”.) The birthday boy himself then took the stage, where he reminded guests about the “rhythm of history” and seized the occasion to preach the gospel of his favorite cause: bipartisanship.Kissinger’s capacity for bipartisanship was renowned. (Republicans Condoleezza Rice and Donald Rumsfeld were in attendance early in the evening, and later in the night Democrat Hillary Clinton strode in through a freight entrance with open arms, asking: “Ready for round two?”) During the party, McCain gushed that Kissinger “has been a consultant and adviser to every president, Republican and Democrat, since Nixon”. McCain probably spoke for everyone in the ballroom when he added: “I know of no individual who is more respected in the world than Henry Kissinger.”In fact, much of the world reviles Kissinger. The former secretary of state even avoids visiting several countries out of fear that he might be apprehended and charged with war crimes. In 2002, for example, a Chilean court demanded he answer questions about his role in that country’s 1973 coup d’état. In 2001, a French judge sent police officers to Kissinger’s Paris hotel room to serve him a formal request for questioning about the same coup, during which several French citizens were disappeared.Around the same time, he cancelled a trip to Brazil after rumors began circling that he would be detained and compelled to answer questions about his role in Operation Condor, the 1970s scheme that united South American dictatorships in disappearing one another’s exiled opponents. An Argentinian judge had already named Kissinger as one potential “defendant or suspect” in a future criminal indictment.But in the United States, Kissinger is untouchable. There, one of the 20th century’s most prolific butchers is beloved by the rich and powerful, regardless of their partisan affiliation. Kissinger’s bipartisan appeal is straightforward: he was a top strategist of America’s empire of capital at a critical moment in that empire’s development.Small wonder that the political establishment has regarded Kissinger as an asset and not an aberration. He embodied what the two ruling parties share: the resolve to ensure favorable conditions for American investors in as much of the world as possible. A stranger to shame and inhibition, Kissinger was able to guide the American empire through a treacherous period in world history, when the United States’ rise to global domination sometimes seemed on the brink of collapse.The Kissinger doctrine persists today: if sovereign countries refuse to be worked into broader US schemes, the American national security state will move swiftly to undercut their sovereignty. This is business as usual for the US, no matter which party sits in the White House – and Kissinger, while he lives, remains among the chief stewards of this status quo.The historian Gerald Horne once recounted a story about the time Kissinger nearly drowned while canoeing beneath one of the world’s largest waterfalls. Tossed in those churning waters, the statesman was finally forced to confront the terror of losing control, of facing a crisis in which even his own incredible influence could not insulate him from personal disaster. But the panic was only temporary – his guide righted the boat, and Kissinger again escaped unscathed.Perhaps time will soon accomplish what the Victoria Falls failed to do so many decades ago.

Unfortunately, they’re rightTayo BeroRon DeSantis’s war on ‘wokeness’ is part of a larger effort to make Black people feel unwelcome, their identities un-AmericanThu 25 May 2023 06.06 EDTLast modified on Thu 25 May 2023 06.46 EDTThe NAACP has advised Black people to take precautions when traveling to Florida. In a move typically reserved for places experiencing war, social unrest or natural disasters, the group said that it was issuing the Florida advisory in direct response to “Governor Ron DeSantis’ aggressive attempts to erase Black history and to restrict diversity, equity, and inclusion programs in Florida schools”.“Florida is openly hostile toward African Americans, people of color and LGBTQ+ individuals. Before traveling to Florida, please understand that the state of Florida devalues and marginalizes the contributions of, and the challenges faced by African Americans and other communities of color,” the NAACP wrote in a press release issued last week.It’s one of many public rebukes of Florida’s current war against inclusion, in which schools have inevitably become a battleground. Along with slashing funds for diversity and inclusion initiatives at institutions of higher education, DeSantis also recently blocked a new high school AP African American studies class, calling it “a political agenda” and “woke indoctrination”. Some of the offending topics in the course outline included intersectionality, the Black Lives Matter movement, reparations and prison abolition.The NAACP’s warning is important because it’s a stark reminder of how Black erasure is weaponized in the project of white supremacy. History has taught us that any attempt to assert the dominance of whiteness necessarily involves the subjugation, destruction and erasure of Black people. Whether it’s preventing Black people from voting, or blocking access to vital educational material that would teach kids why Black people once couldn’t vote, Black struggle has always gone hand in hand with its own un-remembering.Still, DeSantis’s war against “wokeness” is operating alongside a larger effort to make Black people feel unwelcome, their identities inherently un-American. And in a country where white victimhood has become a powerful motivator, and where misinformation is regularly used to further the cause of white supremacy, it’s not difficult to see how dangerous it is to implicate children and young people in that system of ignorance.Excising Black Americans and their historical struggles from the larger story of the US also lets the country off the hook for the ways it continues to owe an immeasurable debt to its Black people. Yet as the writer Ta-Nehisi Coates highlights in his 2014 essay The Case for Reparations, for every noble effort to figure out how the US can right its wrongs, there have been forces waiting to explain why reparations for Black people are either impossible to achieve or unnecessary to even attempt. Erasing the very knowledge base that helps us remember why these reparations are important only helps further that agenda.Unsurprisingly, rightwing white Americans are responding with jest to news of the NAACP advisory. “Maybe they had a travel advisory because of the humidity, I know that it gets frizzy,” podcast host Steven Crowder said on his show on Monday, apparently referring to the tendency for Black people’s hair to respond to humidity.He and his co-hosts lobbed racist jokes back and forth before Crowder finally said the quiet part out loud: “After the advisory went up, 49 governors called the NAACP asking if they could be added to the list.”This banter is disturbing not because of how uninspired it is as far as “comedy” goes, but because of just how close to reality their jokes come. DeSantis is, after all, launching his presidential bid.The US has never been fully safe for Black people, and as the country shifts toward a very frightening time in its history, it’s taking specific aim at the very people upon whose backs the country was built.

Nancy Jo SalesOur sense of whether women are attractive as they age is so influenced by the media that I’m not sure we’re always in full possession of our feelings about itThu 25 May 2023 06.05 EDTLast modified on Thu 25 May 2023 06.46 EDTMy daughter graduated from college last week, so for fun we watched The Graduate, Mike Nichols’s 1967 classic about an alienated young man and his affair with an older woman.I remember seeing it when I was in college and identifying with Benjamin, the main character played by Dustin Hoffman. Like every other rebellious kid, I resonated with Benjamin’s disdain for the bourgeois mentality of his parents’ generation – the absurdity of the man who urges Benjamin to go into “plastics”! But now, at 58, I realized that Benjamin was actually an entitled creep for wanting to date his lover’s daughter, and it was Mrs Robinson who deserved our sympathy – and how did I not notice how hot she was?There’s no shame in waging war on old age – long live Martha Stewart | Martha GillRead moreAnne Bancroft was only 35 when she played Mrs Robinson, who was supposed to be about 10 years older than that. No doubt someone in Hollywood didn’t think an actress in her 40s could be convincing as a woman alluring enough to attract a recently graduated college boy. The women turned down for the part reportedly included Rita Hayworth, then 49, Lana Turner, 46, Susan Hayward, 50, Patricia Neal, 41, and Doris Day, 45. I looked up pictures of these women at those ages. All bombshells. Which I probably wouldn’t have seen when I was 20.Our sense of whether women continue to be sexually attractive as they age is so heavily influenced by the entertainment, beauty and fashion industries, not to mention social media, that I don’t know if we’re always in full possession of our own feelings about it. And, of course, this influences how women regard themselves. It comes down to representation. If women of a certain age are rarely seen in pop culture as love interests or beauty gurus or models, then that must be because they’re not appealing, right? At least, this is what we internalize.If older women aren’t hot, then why does having sex with one continue to be a leading fantasy?But if older women aren’t hot, then why does having sex with one continue to be a leading fantasy, as the popularity of Milf porn and adult film stars such as Lisa Ann, 51, attests? (I’m not advocating watching porn, here, just pointing out a disconnect.) And why, when I was on Tinder when I was 50, were the only guys who wanted to match with me half my age? Meanwhile, hundreds of women in their 40s, 50s and 60s I’ve heard from after the publication of a book I wrote about dating apps have told me they’ve experienced the same thing.I thought about all this last week when Sports Illustrated was widely praised for putting 81-year-old Martha Stewart on the cover of its annual swimsuit issue, the oldest woman ever to get the spot. “Good for Sports Illustrated!” and “Good for Martha!” were the dominant reactions. Aside from a smattering of predictable haters, most people said they thought Stewart looked great, and wasn’t it terrific that she and Sports Illustrated had done something so inspiring? It became almost a progressive flex to talk about how hot Stewart looked, and how a woman can look hot at any age.So why didn’t this feel like the feminist triumph it should have? Well, for one thing, being asked to be on the cover of Sports Illustrated’s swimsuit issue isn’t exactly like being asked to address the UN general assembly. The issue has long been criticized for sexualizing women. In 1989, a former cover model turned feminist activist, Ann Simonton, called on the magazine to discontinue it, saying: “The swimsuit issue encourages violence and hatred toward women. It dehumanizes women.”It’s interesting how the perennial debate about whether sexualization is empowering or harmful to women really comes into focus when you consider it in the context of older women. Because the problem with sexualization, some say, is that it makes a woman’s attractiveness her central value beyond any of her other qualities. And if a woman’s central value is her hotness, then it actually makes it harder for her to be seen as having much value as she gets older. It’s harder for older women to look hot in the narrow definition demanded by current standards – which insist that women above all look youthful, preferably thin with long legs, perfect skin, lustrous hair. Like Martha Stewart on the cover of Sports Illustrated.Most older women don’t have the lucky combination of money and genes that helped the 81-year-old Stewart look so good. We have jowls. We have wrinkles. We have stretch marks on our stomachs from having children. We’ve put on some weight. We have crinkly necks.But we know stuff, more than we ever did, which gives us confidence. And that makes us hot to the people who find us attractive. We’re hot for other reasons than looking good in a swimsuit. We’re hot because we’ve lived some life, and it shows on our faces. And it wasn’t until we got to be old, when that other kind of hotness went away, that we finally got to see that we’re hot for who we are, not how we look.

It’s authoritarianismThu 25 May 2023 05.08 EDTLast modified on Thu 25 May 2023 11.32 EDTThe real significance of Ron DeSantis’s presidential announcement on Twitter had little to do with DeSantis but everything to do with Musk.It’s that Twitter, under Musk, has fully embraced the political right.Why is Musk doing this? He acts as if he wants to be the darling of libertarian bros. But he’s really aiming to lead democracy’s foes.Negotiating with post-Trump Republicans is like dealing with a toddler’s tantrum | Richard WolffeRead moreMusk wants to crush unions and declare the United States a free-to-make-as-much-as-you-can-on-the-backs-of-working-stiffs zone.He calls himself a “free speech absolutist”, but that’s utter baloney. He wants to elevate the speech of people like DeSantis but suppress the speech of workers who want to unionize.He’s even gone along with Turkey’s recent ban on anti-regime comments in the run-up to the Turkish election.DeSantis is not exactly a libertarian himself, of course – unless you define a libertarian as someone who bans books, forces women to give birth, threatens to take trans youth away from parents who approve of them getting gender-affirming care, prohibits teachers from mentioning gender identity or sexual orientation, bars teachers from talking about America’s history of racism, and wreaks vengeance even on Mickey Mouse for opposing his authoritarian policies.What unites Musk and DeSantis isn’t libertarianism at all. It’s authoritarianism.Twitter started to become a rightwing media hotspot when Musk lifted bans on thousands of accounts that had spread disinformation about the pandemic and the 2020 elections.More recently, Tucker Carlson has said he would revive his show on Twitter after losing his Fox News slot (Musk has denied that Twitter has signed a deal with Carlson).It’s also been reported that the Daily Wire, a rightwing, anti-democracy media outlet, will make Twitter the home for all its podcasts.Unquestionably, Twitter is benefiting from the dissatisfaction of the anti-democracy movement with Fox News. Musk can credibly claim to be outside the mainstream rightwing media world of Rupert Murdoch.But the reason Musk wants to be a force on the right is because he wants to be in control.That’s been his business MO since the start. It’s why he refused a seat on Twitter’s board and instead mounted a hostile takeover. It’s why he hates unions.And now Musk wants to control everything else. He wants to dominate the right wing of American politics.Not content to be the (or among the) richest on the planet, not satisfied with taking over one of the biggest media machines in the world, Musk now wants to impose his will on America and the world directly.Remind you of any other billionaire? Say, the former guy?Musk said on Tuesday he isn’t formally backing any Republican candidate. But he is backing Republicans. And you can bet his eye is focused like a laser on the biggest Republican of all.Right now, Musk wants to send Donald Trump a message that he – Musk – has the power to make life difficult for Trump if Trump so much as hints at making life difficult for Musk.Musk knows that the best way to deal with a bully is to bully him. Show him you are even bigger than he is. Have more billions of dollars than he does. Have more millions of Twitter followers than he does.And show him you have power over him by helping Republicans who are opposing him.Which is why Musk is helping DeSantis. And why, earlier this week, Musk retweeted a campaign kickoff video for Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina.Musk is only 51. Trump is 77. Trump may be the next president, but Musk will outlast him.The US constitution bars Musk from becoming president, as he was born in Pretoria, South Africa. But there’s no end to the power he can wield over America and the world in coming decades.And make no mistake. Musk plans to wield it.

(The clear message to other rich Republicans: you can desert Trump and we’ll still have your back on tax policy, wages and the like. It’s the digital-age equivalent of a bumper sticker for your luxury car: Safe With DeSantis.)The rollout was plagued with embarrassing glitches, no big surprise given Twitter’s general meltdown under Musk’s ownership.Beneath the governor’s endless culture wars is an appalling reality of policies that fail to serve the vast majority of Florida’s citizens: the non-richBut the far more important question is what would a DeSantis presidency – however unlikely it seems right now – mean to the United States and the world? Is the 44-year-old merely a younger and less impulsive Trump, or does he offer his own special set of worries for those who care about democracy, fairness and good government?For the answer, just consider what the two-term governor has wrought in his home state and in his early forays into world affairs.One clue came this very week as a Florida school district confirmed that – after only a single complaint from a parent – a school had decided to remove from the elementary-school area of its library The Hill We Climb, by the young Black poet Amanda Gorman, whose gorgeous recitation of it stole the show at Biden’s 2021 inauguration.Presumably, DeSantis had nothing to do with that particular decision but his tireless campaign against supposed wokeness (read: egalitarian portrayals or treatment of Black, gay and transgender people) has freed a torrent of censorship. (One school district looked askance at both Toni Morrison’s Beloved and Margaret Atwood’s The Handmaid’s Tale, proving that Florida’s book banners have a discerning eye for great literature – and want no part of it.)On women’s reproductive rights, DeSantis signed into law a bill to ban abortion after six weeks of pregnancy, before many women even know they are pregnant. He proudly signed bills that ban gender-affirming care for minors, go after drag shows, restrict the discussion of personal pronouns in schools and force individuals to use particular bathrooms. As the Associated Press bluntly wrote, he puts forth a narrative that experts in the nation’s major medical associations say is false, such as the idea that children are routinely being “mutilated”.And of course, he has pulled attention-getting and destructive stunts like flying planeloads of migrants to Martha’s Vineyard in Massachusetts and feuding with Disney, a major employer and tourist draw. And on the global front, he infamously called Russia’s invasion of Ukraine a “territorial dispute”, a judgment he was forced to walk back when it didn’t play well within the Republican party.What gets less media focus, though, is that while making sure that his home state is “where woke goes to die”, DeSantis has also made Florida a place that, as the journalist and author William Kleinknecht reported, “falls short in almost any measure that matters to the lives of its citizens”.‘All hat, no cattle’: Ron DeSantis, the ‘anti-woke’ Florida governor running for presidentRead moreFlorida is at the bottom of state rankings for healthcare, school funding and long-term elder care; it’s where teachers’ salaries are among the lowest in the nation, as are unemployment benefits, and where efforts to raise the low minimum wage drew the governor’s active opposition.Then there’s the state’s regressive tax structure, which makes it clear why the rich are flocking his way.“Florida is the ideal haven for privileged Americans who don’t want to pay their fair share of taxes,” Kleinknecht wrote, with no income tax for individuals and a rock-bottom corporate tax rate. With the tax burden in Florida falling disproportionately on the poor and middle class (because the state’s tax revenue comes mostly from sales and excise taxes), the state ranks worse than comparable northern states in diabetes, cancer deaths, teen birth rates and infant mortality.What this means is that beneath the flashy distraction of the governor’s endless and often cruel culture wars is an appalling reality of policies that fail to serve the vast majority of Florida’s citizens: the non-rich.As Florida goes, so goes the nation? If Americans elect Ron DeSantis – and let’s face it, stranger things have happened – we might be unlucky enough to find out.

The ban on trans medical care takes effect in October and the abortion ban goes into effect immediately. And so Nebraska has become the latest state to determine through law what might have once been determined by the more pliable tools of custom or imagination: the way that the sexed body a person is born with shapes the kind of life they can live.Republican attacks on trans people smack of fascism | Robert ReichRead moreBe it through forced pregnancy or prohibited transition, the state of Nebraska now claims the right to determine what its citizens will do with their sexed bodies – what those bodies will look like, how they will function and what they will mean. It is a part of the right’s ongoing project to roll back the victories of the feminist and gay rights movements, to re-establish the dominance of men in public life, to narrow possibilities for difference and expression and to inscribe in law a firm definition and hierarchy of gender: that people are either men or women and that men are better.They’re not alone. Abortion bans have been proliferating wildly in the year since the US supreme court eliminated the right in their Dobbs decision, declaring that any state can compel women to remain pregnant, and creating different, lesser entitlements to bodily freedom and self-determination based on sex. But as the abortion bans have spread like an infection across the American south, midwest, and mountain west, they have been accompanied by a related political disease: laws seeking to prohibit minors and sometimes adults, from accessing medical treatments that facilitate gender transitions.Twenty-five states have enacted pre-viability abortion bans since Roe was overturned last summer, although in some states, like Iowa and Montana, abortion has remained legal pending judicial stays. Meanwhile, 20 states now ban gender-affirming care for minors, with a rush of bills being introduced over the past months. In addition to Nebraska, a slew of states have passed transition-care bans in 2023, including Utah, Mississippi, South Dakota, Iowa, Tennessee and Florida. Texas is soon to join them.It is not a coincidence that the states which have the most punitive and draconian bans on abortion have also adopted the most aggressive targeting of transgender people and medical care. The bills are part of the same project by conservatives, who have been emboldened in their campaign of gender revanchism in the wake of Dobbs. Both abortion bans and transition care bans further the same goal: to transform the social category of gender into an enforceable legal status, linked to the sexed body at birth and to prescribe a narrow and claustrophobic view of what that gender status must mean.It is no accident that the states that would forbid a teenager from transitioning are the same that would compel that teenager to give birth; it is no accident that the states with the greatest control over what women do with their reproductive organs are the ones where women’s restrooms have become sites of surveillance and control, with patrons, cis and trans alike, subjected to invasive and degrading inquisitions as to whether they are conforming sufficiently to the demands of femininity. That Nebraska combined these two projects into one bill, then, is less inventive than it is a dropping of pretense: the anti-feminist movement is anti-trans, and the anti-trans panic is at its core anti-feminist.The attacks on gender freedom from the right are not only united in their ideology, but increasingly in their rhetoric. Abortion and trans rights activists have long insisted that both abortion and transition are healthcare. It’s an apt and worthy argument, considering that both involve the interventions of medical professionals, both facilitate the wellbeing and happiness of those who receive them, and both result in horrific health complications when denied, from the high rates of mental distress and horrific, needless pregnancy complications that have been ushered in by Dobbs, to the dramatic rates of suicidal ideation and mental health problems in trans people who are denied the ability to transition. But increasingly, the right has begun to attack the notion of abortion and trans rights as healthcare, arguing that neither pregnancy nor non-transition constitute “illness”.At a recent oral argument over the fate of the abortion drug mifepristone, Judge James Ho, a Trump appointee on the fifth circuit court of appeals whose rabidly conservative opinions and trollish affect suggest supreme court ambitions, argued that the drug should be removed from the market in part because “pregnancy is not a serious illness”. “When we celebrate Mother’s Day,” Ho asked, his voice dripping with contempt, “are we celebrating a serious illness?” In that moment, Ho sounded uncannily like anti-trans activists seeking to ban care for young people, who argue, ad nauseam, that “puberty is not a disorder”.The rhetoric suggests a narrow and myopic view of “health”, the notion that bodies have destinies and should be made to fulfill them regardless of the desires of the people involved. A healthy body, we’re told, is one that conforms to socially imposed gender hierarchies, regardless of how miserable that conformity and imposition makes the people who inhabit those bodies.But while these practices of abortion and transition care constitute medicine and while their outcomes encourage health, it would be a mistake to fight the political battle for these services only on the ground of what counts as “healthcare”. Because the truth is that conservatives do not care about health – they don’t care about the integrity of the medical profession, or about patient outcomes, or about bodies, not really. They care about people, and about making sure that those people stay in line. In the grand tradition of feminists and queers alike, we should refuse to.

It’s deeply troubling that so few of our political leaders have called for the obvious moral response to this ever-widening scandal: Thomas should resign.The US supreme court’s alleged ethics issues are worse than you probably realize | Moira DoneganRead moreThere’s been far too much shilly-shallying about all this. It’s not nearly enough to call on Thomas to belatedly comply with disclosure laws or to repay Harlan Crow, the billionaire rightwing activist who has showered $1m in favors on Thomas and his family. Thomas’s myriad violations are too serious, his contempt for ethics and conflict-of-interest rules too blatant, for us to accept half measures or slaps on the wrist. He has disgraced the court. It is time for him to go.It is probably naive to hope that Thomas will resign without a huge push. That’s why far more public pressure is needed to get Thomas to do the right thing. Editorial writers, columnists, law school deans, political science professors, good government groups, bar associations and members of the clergy should all urge him to step down.There’s someone else who should call for Thomas to resign, and that’s Chief Justice John Roberts. By acting as if Thomas has done nothing wrong, Roberts looks pathetic and weak. Roberts even seems to be cosseting and enabling unethical behavior by the justices. Indeed, he seems to think it’s perfectly fine for billionaire ideological activists to ply justices with favors. I suspect that Roberts is woefully out of touch with public sentiment. He evidently thinks that the average American is an amoral moron untroubled by a supreme court justice accepting huge favors from a billionaire who has poured millions of dollars into efforts to push American’s politics to the far right.There’s another shocking aspect to the scandal: not only do many Republican lawmakers act as if Thomas has done nothing wrong, but they assert – absurdly – that anyone making a fuss about his behavior is doing so only because they dislike his judicial opinions. That’s slimy sophistry. Thomas’s defenders know he did wrong, but will not admit it. In these polarized times, they want to stand by their man. Too many Republicans eagerly excuse Thomas’s greedy, self-serving, illegal behavior, just as too many eagerly excuse Trump’s greedy, sexist, racist, dishonest and illegal behavior.All this reminds me of the famous question – “Have you no sense of decency?” – that helped bring down an earlier corrupt, dishonest politician, Senator Joseph McCarthy. We should all ask Thomas the same question, considering that he thinks it’s totally fine to take big favors from a billionaire ideologue who donates heavily to many rightwing groups that file briefs before the supreme court. Indeed, I wonder whether many of our political leaders have lost their sense of decency because they seem happy to give a pass to Thomas’s behavior.In 1969, senators, both Democratic and Republican, demanded that the liberal justice Abe Fortas resign over matters that seem trivial compared with Clarence Thomas’s misdeeds. Fortas was pilloried for receiving $20,000 in fees (worth $165,000 in today’s dollars) to consult for a foundation that focused on civil rights and religious freedom. Fortas’s big problem was that the businessman who created that foundation, Louis Wolfson, was later investigated and convicted of selling unregistered stock. (At the time, other justices, including Chief Justice Warren Burger, also received fees consulting for non-profits.)Fortas had returned the $20,000 and quit the foundation in 1966, three years before the scandal became public, with the help of the Nixon administration. Fortas denied any wrongdoing, but that didn’t stop prominent Democratic senators like Walter Mondale and Joseph Tydings from joining the call for him to resign – even though Richard Nixon, a Republican, would name Fortas’s successor.So I ask: have we as a nation lost our sense of decency? Why aren’t more people calling for Thomas to resign when his wrongdoing is far worse than what Fortas did? Consider the evidence:
From 2003 to 2007, Thomas repeatedly failed to disclose that his wife, Ginni, was paid $686,589 by the conservative Heritage Foundation, which often files amicus briefs to the court.

In 2008 and 2009, Thomas failed to disclose that Crow paid roughly $100,000 in private school tuition for a grand-nephew Thomas was raising.

In 2011 and 2012, Thomas failed to disclose at least $80,000 in payments to his wife that Leonard Leo – the leader of nationwide efforts to install conservative judges – had secretly arranged to be paid by an organization that filed amicus briefs to the supreme court.

In 2014, Thomas failed to disclose that one of Crow’s companies paid $133,363 for three Georgia properties owned by Thomas and his family.

For at least two decades, Thomas has taken free luxury travel and vacations from Crow on yachts and private jets (valued at more than $500,000) – and repeatedly failed to disclose those favors.

Even though Ginni Thomas repeatedly texted Donald Trump’s White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows, to urge more aggressive efforts to overturn the 2020 election, Clarence Thomas failed to recuse himself from cases involving Trump and January 6. Indeed, Thomas was the only justice to back Trump in a case in which all the other justices rebuked Trump and backed releasing White House records about the January 6 attack.
An acquaintance in the Department of Labor once told me she could not allow me to buy her a $3 cup of coffee. In contrast, Thomas acts as if he is a demigod above the ethical rules that apply to other humans, including other federal employees.Anyone so allergic to complying with basic ethical standards has no place working in government – and least of all serving on the supreme court, where we should expect the highest ethical standards. It is time for Thomas to go.

Republicans win either wayTue 23 May 2023 08.52 EDTLast modified on Tue 23 May 2023 09.36 EDTThe favored metaphor on the left is to compare the trumped-up debt-ceiling crisis to hostage-taking by the House Republicans.But in a true hostage situation, both sides have something major to lose. The perpetrators risk not getting a payoff or, worse, spending decades in prison. For the families of the victims and the police, the danger is that the hostages will be killed during the negotiations or in the midst of a botched rescue mission.Negotiating with post-Trump Republicans is like dealing with a toddler’s tantrum | Richard WolffeRead moreFor Kevin McCarthy and the defaulters (which, incidentally, is a promising name for a band), there is no downside. If Joe Biden ultimately hands over his sword in surrender, the Republican incendiaries will be lionized as conquering heroes from the Fox News green room to the dining room at Mar-a-Lago.Sure, the reviled liberal media will grumble if Republican intransigence forces America into default, guaranteeing higher interest for years to come, and jeopardizing the world economy. But that crazed toughness would prove that the House speaker is not a “Republican In Name Only” (Rino) squish like his deal-making predecessor John Boehner, who at the last minute helped avert default in 2011.Marching off the fiscal cliff like lemmings will also inoculate House Republicans against a rightwing primary challenge – which, in Republican circles, is a fate worse than death. And since members of Congress can trade stocks, every smart Republican can personally prosper during the coming cataclysmic economic downturn by adroitly shorting the Dow Jones Average.In contrast, the consequences of debt-ceiling brinkmanship are dire for Joe Biden. In the best conceivable case – one that will prompt dismay among liberals – the president would reluctantly agree to tight spending caps that will limit his domestic agenda and penalize the poor. But, at least, that option would avert default.At the end of his Sunday press conference in Hiroshima, Biden publicly acknowledged the devastating political consequences for him if America were unable to pay its bills. Channeling the thought process of House Republican zealots as they head towards the abyss, Biden said: “Because I am president, and presidents are responsible for everything, Biden would take the blame. And that’s one way to make sure Biden is not re-elected.”Sad, but true.A default might well mean that Biden would be running for reelection with the economy in a Republican-created tailspin. And it wouldn’t matter politically that, as Biden said, “On the merits, based on what I’ve offered, I would be blameless.”But if Democrats believe that they can win the messaging wars about a default, they’re deluding themselves.An Associated Press/NORC poll, released last week, found that only 20% of Americans say that they understand the debate over the debt ceiling “extremely” or “very well.” That number is significant because it is often hard for political insiders to remember that most Americans do not watch cable TV news or obsessively follow political machinations in Washington. The danger for Democrats is that many of these low-information voters will be persuaded by the implicit one-sentence Republican message: America defaulted because Biden wouldn’t agree to cut government spending to deal with the national debt.In order to appreciate the folly of that glib Republican argument, a voter both has to understand the draconian nature of the Republican budget proposals and to grasp that raising the debt ceiling merely authorizes borrowing rather than new spending. Good luck making that complex case to anyone who doesn’t devotedly read the New York Times or listen to National Public Radio.In an era of streaming and thousands of channels, Biden does not have the option of commanding national attention with an old-fashioned Oval Office address. Moreover, there is no guarantee that Biden, with his rambling asides and workmanlike delivery, would convince anyone with a televised speech. To illustrate that point, here is the awkward way Biden highlighted the dangers of the Republican budget plan in his Sunday press conference: “I’m not going to agree to a deal that protects, for example, a $30bn tax break for the oil industry, which made $200bn last year – they don’t need an incentive of another $30bn – while putting healthcare of 21 million Americans at risk by going after Medicaid.”The harsh reality is that Biden has little choice but to grub for the best deal he can. While there is a strong legal argument that the debt ceiling is unconstitutional under the 14th amendment, no one at the treasury department or anywhere else knows how the global markets would react if Biden thumbed his nose at Kevin McCarthy and his wingnut caucus.With the continuing danger that Donald Trump’s comeback tour will end in the Oval Office, there are more important matters on the table than punishing Kevin McCarthy for his hostage-taking. In fact, the best revenge would be a sweeping Biden reelection that brings with it a Democratic House majority. Then, in 2025, without a presidential election on the horizon, Biden would be free to blow up the dangerously irrational debt-ceiling law.

Under Baker’s plan, social security would lose interest on its funds.If Congress still didn’t raise the debt ceiling, the administration would borrow from the railroad retirement and military retirement trust funds.If the impasse continued, it would begin selling gold from the US gold reserve “even though that could undercut confidence here and abroad based on the widespread belief that the gold reserve is the foundation of our financial system”, said Baker.An agreement was reached after the Reagan administration had begun raiding social security, but before it took any other measures.The comptroller general of the United States later found Baker’s raid on social security technically illegal but concluded nonetheless that Baker “did not act unreasonably” under the circumstances.I recount this history to give you some perspective on the current debt-ceiling crisis.First, showdowns over the debt ceiling have been going on for a long time.Second, they have often been fueled by soaring national debts due to Republican tax cuts for the wealthy and big corporations.The 1985 standoff involved a refusal by Senate Democrats to support a balanced budget, even though it was Reagan’s mammoth spending on the military and huge tax cut that had doubled the national debt in less than five years.Finally, they have required Treasury secretaries to do extraordinary things to keep paying the nation’s bills notwithstanding, sometimes technically illegal.Hence, there have never been “X-dates” at which time the treasury runs dry. There are just ever more extreme government bookkeeping measures.But here’s the difference this time. Previous standoffs have been carefully crafted dramas in which both sides demonstrate their commitments to their position, knowing full well how the play will end – with the debt ceiling lifted.This time, though, gonzo lawmakers like Marjorie Taylor Greene and nihilists like the current Republican frontrunner for president have considerable influence.And unlike Bob Dole in 1985, these players have no real commitment to cutting the government debt. (Were that their goal, presumably they wouldn’t have supported the massive 2017 tax cuts for the wealthy and big corporations that fueled the debt, or would now urge its repeal. And they certainly wouldn’t demand cuts in staffing for the IRS, which House Republicans are also now doing.)Their only commitment is to power – gaining dominance over, and submission from, Democrats, progressives, putative “coastal elites” and so-called “deep state” bureaucrats.For them, this is not play-acting. It’s not for show. It’s for real. If they don’t get their way, they’re prepared to blow up the economy.In fact, as the so-called X-date looms ever closer, their demands have only escalated.Which is why it’s critical for Biden to continue paying the government’s bills and for the treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, to continue using every bookkeeping scheme imaginable to find the means to pay those bills.They must never declare an “X-date”, and never default.If Kevin McCarthy and his band of radicals don’t like this, let them take the Biden administration to court.Let House Republicans argue in the courts that the 1917 act establishing the debt ceiling has precedence over section 4 of the 14th amendment, which requires that the “the validity of the public debt …. shall not be questioned.”Let them claim that the debt-ceiling act takes precedence over other acts of Congress that require the president, for example, to pay interest on the federal debt, distribute social security benefits, and pay bills from defense contractors and everyone else who has relied on the full faith and credit of the United States.Let McCarthy and House Republicans make the case before the courts that they have standing to sue Biden for paying the government’s debts as they come due.Finally, let McCarthy, Marjorie Taylor Greene, and the other loonies demand openly and publicly in court that Biden not honor the full faith and credit of the United States – with the predictable results that the cost of borrowing soars, bond markets crash, the stock market plummets, the global economy is in turmoil, the dollar’s status as the world’s major currency is up for grabs, America is plunged into a deep recession, and millions of jobs are lost.In other words, leave it to McCarthy and House Republicans to seek to enforce their dangerous nonsense about the debt ceiling – so Americans can see clearly what they’re up to.

Photograph: Chip Somodevilla/Getty ImagesThe ObserverEconomic policyThe Observer view on Britain’s economy: it is very sick, but there are remediesObserver editorialAusterity, Brexit and catastrophic fiscal decisions have inflicted long-term damage to Britain’s productive capacity. Labour is offering the renewal it so badly needsSun 28 May 2023 01.31 EDTLast modified on Sun 28 May 2023 03.29 EDTIt has been a week of bad economic news. The latest data from the Office for National Statistics confirmed that inflation has fallen in the UK, but to 8.7%, slightly higher than had been predicted. This triggered a strong reaction in the bond markets, pushing up the cost of government borrowing to almost the same as it was in the wake of Kwasi Kwarteng’s mini-budget that tanked the markets last September.It is a sobering reminder of the lasting legacy of Liz Truss’s brief premiership. In just 49 days, she and her chancellor undermined long-term investor confidence to the extent that the UK government, once able to borrow at interest rates of almost zero, now faces some of the highest borrowing costs of developed nations, with these costs liable to rise even further as a result of only moderately bad economic news. It means that for the first time in decades, the UK is subject to the same sorts of external market pressures on its investment, tax and spending decisions as much less affluent economies.The British economy has been subject to the same shocks as others around the world such as the pandemic and the impact of the Ukraine war on energy and food prices. But the UK has fared far worse than its competitors as a result of long-term structural weaknesses and terrible political choices.The UK was too reliant on financial services to drive its buoyant growth in the 2000s, creating significant regional inequality between London and the south-east, and the rest of the country. This growth masked low productivity in other sectors and an economy too dependent on consumer spending, fuelled by personal debt secured against a housing price bubble, with not enough business investment and spending on skills. These weaknesses were exposed by the world financial crisis of 2008, but instead of trying to redress these imbalances the Conservatives have made the UK’s structural issues even worse.By sharply increasing barriers to trade, Brexit has made it more difficult for British companies to grow through exportsThis is the product of their austerity policies – deep cuts to the welfare safety net, public services and national infrastructure that have not only caused immense hardship in the here and now, but have damaged the long-term productive capacity of the economy. This is evident, for example, in the skills shortages, and in the fact that the pandemic appears to have had a much bigger impact on labour participation rates as a result of people leaving employment due to long-term sickness than in other countries. The UK’s participation rate in the workforce is below where it was before the pandemic, adding to inflationary pressures.Austerity has been made worse by the hard Brexit pursued by Boris Johnson and other Tory Eurosceptics. By sharply increasing barriers to trade, Brexit has made it more difficult for British companies to grow through exporting and has had a significant depressive effect on growth. It, too, has added to inflation, one study by the London School of Economics suggests that as a direct result of Brexit, British households have collectively spent £7bn more on their food bills than they would have otherwise done since December 2019. All this means that Britain is suffering from the second worst productivity growth in the G7. The impact of these appalling economic decisions will not dissipate when the Conservatives leave office. They will continue to affect the British economy in the long term and will take a new government years to address.Should Labour win the next election, its shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves will face an unenviable economic inheritance. Unlike in 1997, when the economy and tax receipts were booming, Labour’s overriding focus will have to be how to restore the economy to a healthier growth trajectory in order to fund the expansion of public services and the welfare state the country so desperately needs. That will be a huge task, requiring an ambitious industrial and skills policy. Reeves set out the emerging detail of her approach in a speech in Washington last week. She was reassuringly sober about the scale of the challenge. Labour would pursue an active industrial policy, centred on a £28bn-a-year capital investment programme in greening the economy, and expanding affordable childcare and skills provision to get more people into work.Improving the productive capacity of the economy from the laggard starting point left by a combination of austerity, Brexit and Truss’s abandoned tax cuts will not be easy. Much will depend on the detail of policy:, on exactly how capital investment and extra money for skills will be spent; it is easier to spend money badly than well, and its impact on growth will be a matter of robust policy design. But Reeves is showing how much more she has to offer than the slash-and-burn approach of Truss and Kwarteng, or the acceptance of painfully high interest rates in the absence of any other plan we have seen from Rishi Sunak and Jeremy Hunt.Britain urgently needs a period of economic renewal, and only a Labour government can deliver that.TopicsEconomic policyOpinionInflationConservativesAusterityEconomic recoveryBrexitEconomicseditorialsReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedBusinessEconomicsDiversity & equality in businessSmall businessRetailNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

This increasingly desperate post-Brexit quest for relevance and influence will take Rishi Sunak to Moldova this week, a poor, landlocked former Soviet republic of fewer than 3 million people, squeezed between Ukraine and Romania, that many in the UK might struggle to locate without help from Google Maps.Sunak will attend the second annual summit of the European Political Community, to which 46 other national leaders are invited. Ironically, the EPC is the brainchild of France’s president and Tory Brexit bogeyman, Emmanuel Macron. It brings together EU states plus countries, such as Turkey and Serbia, denied EU membership, and outliers, such as the UK and Norway, that don’t want it.The summit will seek to develop common positions on security, climate and energy. But for Moldova and its president, Maia Sandu, the supportive presence of so many senior foreign leaders in the capital, Chișinău, is a moment of great national hope. It puts Moldova, formerly Bessarabia, on the map at a critical juncture. It’s symbolically important for Britain and the west, too. The reason can been summed up in one word: Russia.‘We came to say loudly, confidently and proudly that Moldovans are Europeans!’, Maia Sandu told a rally in Chișinău on 21 May 2023. Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty ImagesIf Vladimir Putin had succeeded in overrunning Ukraine last year, it is widely believed that his troops would have swept through Transnistria, a separatist border region of Moldova controlled by pro-Russia forces, and seized the remainder of the country. In February, a plot to topple Sandu’s government was uncovered. Moscow issued the usual denials.There’s no doubt Moldova remains a Russian target.That’s mainly because, like Ukrainians, many in Moldova see their future in the west, inside the EU. Sandu has also hinted that its traditional neutrality could be jettisoned in favour of joining a “larger alliance” – meaning Nato, with which it already cooperates. These aspirations pre-date the Ukraine invasion. Putin’s aggressive behaviour has greatly accelerated the westwards shift.The EU granted Moldova candidate status last June, allocating millions of euros in loans, and helping reduce reliance on Russian gas. But it has yet to set a date for accession negotiations. Last Sunday, 75,000 people joined Sandu at a rally in Chișinău calling for full EU membership. “We came to say loudly, confidently and proudly that Moldovans are Europeans!” she said.Such unbridled enthusiasm for Europe may be hard for Sunak to get his head around – but he should pay attention. The rally recalled the 2013 Euromaidan demonstrations in Kyiv, when Ukrainians chose the EU over Moscow. That democratic rejection led directly to Russia’s first invasion the following year. Putin complained then of supposed Nato threats and western encroachment in Russia’s old “near abroad”. Now he does so again, in Moldova.Sandu faces an unscrupulous, Kremlin-backed opposition and vocal pro-Russia minority. She warned that her country is vulnerable to continued Russian destabilisation, sabotage, disinformation and influence operations. At the rally beside her, Roberta Metsola, European parliament president, pledged that the EU would welcome Moldova “with open arms and open hearts”.That is a promise that must be kept, and soon. Moldova is on the frontline of the west’s confrontation with Russia. It has been hit by missiles and threatened with regime change. Putin must not be allowed to spread his poison there. If Sunak wants to be useful, he should demonstrate Britain’s support for this vital piece of European integration with an offer of security assistance and aid. Who knows? He might win back some friends.TopicsMoldovaOpinionEuropean UnionRussiaRishi SunakEuropeeditorialsReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

That stark warning surely applies to southern Europe as a whole, as the prospect of another summer crisis looms, following a disastrously dry winter.An absence of melting snow from the Alps has left Italy’s Po River as shallow as during last year’s searingly hot summer. In January and February, France recorded the highest number of rain-free days since records began, and water restrictions are in place in the Pyrénées-Orientales region. About 90% of mainland Portugal is suffering from drought, judged to be severe in one-fifth of the country. In Spain, from Catalonia to Andalucía, unseasonable heat has contributed to reservoirs drying up and a disastrous drop in olive oil production. By the middle of this month, southern Spain had received barely 30% of expected rainfall. As temperatures continue to rise, and Europe warms faster than the global average, drought across vast swathes of territory is simply becoming the norm.There are obvious moves that can be made to alleviate water shortages. A quarter of drinking water in Europe is lost because of leaky pipelines. In Italy – one of the worst offenders in this respect – a drought taskforce has been created to improve water infrastructure. In France, Emmanuel Macron has set a 10% water savings target for all sectors of the economy by 2030 and demanded far greater reuse of wastewater. New, low-energy desalination techniques will be key to guaranteeing future supplies of water for human consumption.There is, however, no foreseeable technical fix that will allow difficult decisions over an increasingly scarce resource to be evaded. The politics of a new, parched reality will be fraught and contested, particularly in relation to food production in transformed terrain. In France, plans for new reservoirs to irrigate farmland have led to violent clashes between police and environmental protesters, who argue that agricultural practices need to become less water-intensive.In Andalucía, regional proposals to legalise irrigation in part of the Doñana Natural Space – one the world’s most important wetlands – have become a wedge issue ahead of local elections this weekend. Vox, a far-right party which has made political gains through downplaying the severity of the climate emergency, has positioned itself as a champion of the strawberry farmers who would benefit from the plans. In Seville, thousands have demonstrated against the project, which has been condemned by both Madrid and the European Commission.Global heating will eventually force rural economies such as those in Andalucía to diversify to survive. They will require substantial assistance from both national governments and the European Union to do so. More needs to be done to help those who find themselves at the sharp end of an emerging crisis for agricultural production. An absence of proper economic support will breed dangerous resentment in regions that have traditionally prided themselves on supplying Europe’s fruit, vegetable and cereal needs.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

He should be ashamed to be seen in publicBhaskar Sunkara and Jonah WaltersMuch of the world views Kissinger as a war criminal – yet in the US, surrounded by powerful friends, he is feted as a celebrity intellectualSat 27 May 2023 04.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 27 May 2023 04.56 EDTHenry Kissinger turns 100 on Saturday, but his legacy has never been in worse shape. Though many commentators now speak of a “tortured and deadly legacy”, for decades Kissinger was lauded by all quarters of the political and media establishment.A teenage Jewish refugee who fled Nazi Germany, Kissinger charted an unlikely path to some of the most powerful positions on Earth. Even more strangely, as national security adviser and secretary of state under Nixon and Ford, he became something of a pop icon.Back then, one fawning profile of the young statesman cast him as “the sex symbol of the Nixon administration”. In 1969, according to the profile, Kissinger attended a party full of Washington socialites with an envelope marked “Top Secret” tucked under his arm. The other party guests could hardly contain their curiosity, so Kissinger deflected their questions with a quip: the envelope contained his copy of the latest Playboy magazine. (Hugh Hefner apparently found this hilarious and thereafter ensured that the national security adviser got a free subscription.)What the envelope really contained was a draft copy of Nixon’s “silent majority” speech, a now-infamous address that aimed to draw a sharp line between the moral decadence of antiwar liberals and Nixon’s unflinching realpolitik. The actual top-secret work he was doing in the 1970s aged just as poorly. Within a few short years he masterminded illegal bombings in Laos and Cambodia and enabled genocide in East Timor and East Pakistan. Meanwhile, Kissinger was known among Beltway socialites as “the playboy of the western wing”. He liked to be photographed, and photographers obliged. He was a fixture on gossip pages, particularly when his dalliances with famous women spilled into public view – like when he and the actor Jill St John inadvertently set off the alarm at her Hollywood mansion late one night as they stole away to her pool. (“I was teaching her chess,” Kissinger explained later.)While Kissinger gallivanted with Washington’s jet set, he and Nixon – a pair so firmly joined at the hip that Isaiah Berlin christened them “Nixonger” – were busy contriving a political brand rooted in their supposed disdain for the liberal elite, whose effete morality, they claimed, could lead only to paralysis.Kissinger certainly disdained the antiwar movement, disparaging demonstrators as “upper-middle-class college kids” and warning: “The very people who shout ‘Power to the People’ are not going to be the people who take over this country if it turns into a test of strength.” He also scorned women: “To me women are no more than a pastime, a hobby. Nobody devotes too much time to a hobby.” But it’s indisputable that Kissinger held a fondness for the gilded liberalism of high society, the exclusive parties and steak dinners and flashbulbs.High society loved him back. Gloria Steinem, an occasional dining companion, called Kissinger “the only interesting man in the Nixon administration”. The gossip columnist Joyce Haber described him as “worldly, humorous, sophisticated, and a cavalier with women.” The Hef considered him a friend, and once claimed in print that a poll of his models revealed Kissinger to be the man most widely desired for dates at the Playboy mansion.This infatuation didn’t end with the 1970s. When Kissinger turned 90 in 2013, his red-carpet birthday celebration was attended by a bipartisan crowd that included Michael Bloomberg, Roger Ailes, Barbara Walters, even “veteran for peace” John Kerry, along with some 300 other A-listers.An article in Women’s Wear Daily reported that Bill Clinton and John McCain delivered the birthday toasts in a ballroom done up in chinoiserie, to please the night’s guest of honor. (McCain, who spent more than five years as a POW, described his “wonderful affection” for Kissinger, “because of the Vietnam war, which was something that was enormously impactful to both of our lives”.) The birthday boy himself then took the stage, where he reminded guests about the “rhythm of history” and seized the occasion to preach the gospel of his favorite cause: bipartisanship.Kissinger’s capacity for bipartisanship was renowned. (Republicans Condoleezza Rice and Donald Rumsfeld were in attendance early in the evening, and later in the night Democrat Hillary Clinton strode in through a freight entrance with open arms, asking: “Ready for round two?”) During the party, McCain gushed that Kissinger “has been a consultant and adviser to every president, Republican and Democrat, since Nixon”. McCain probably spoke for everyone in the ballroom when he added: “I know of no individual who is more respected in the world than Henry Kissinger.”In fact, much of the world reviles Kissinger. The former secretary of state even avoids visiting several countries out of fear that he might be apprehended and charged with war crimes. In 2002, for example, a Chilean court demanded he answer questions about his role in that country’s 1973 coup d’état. In 2001, a French judge sent police officers to Kissinger’s Paris hotel room to serve him a formal request for questioning about the same coup, during which several French citizens were disappeared.Around the same time, he cancelled a trip to Brazil after rumors began circling that he would be detained and compelled to answer questions about his role in Operation Condor, the 1970s scheme that united South American dictatorships in disappearing one another’s exiled opponents. An Argentinian judge had already named Kissinger as one potential “defendant or suspect” in a future criminal indictment.But in the United States, Kissinger is untouchable. There, one of the 20th century’s most prolific butchers is beloved by the rich and powerful, regardless of their partisan affiliation. Kissinger’s bipartisan appeal is straightforward: he was a top strategist of America’s empire of capital at a critical moment in that empire’s development.Small wonder that the political establishment has regarded Kissinger as an asset and not an aberration. He embodied what the two ruling parties share: the resolve to ensure favorable conditions for American investors in as much of the world as possible. A stranger to shame and inhibition, Kissinger was able to guide the American empire through a treacherous period in world history, when the United States’ rise to global domination sometimes seemed on the brink of collapse.The Kissinger doctrine persists today: if sovereign countries refuse to be worked into broader US schemes, the American national security state will move swiftly to undercut their sovereignty. This is business as usual for the US, no matter which party sits in the White House – and Kissinger, while he lives, remains among the chief stewards of this status quo.The historian Gerald Horne once recounted a story about the time Kissinger nearly drowned while canoeing beneath one of the world’s largest waterfalls. Tossed in those churning waters, the statesman was finally forced to confront the terror of losing control, of facing a crisis in which even his own incredible influence could not insulate him from personal disaster. But the panic was only temporary – his guide righted the boat, and Kissinger again escaped unscathed.Perhaps time will soon accomplish what the Victoria Falls failed to do so many decades ago.

Work obliges me to catch many planes and I am old enough to appreciate that if you can travel with an elasticised waist, loose cuffs and a hood – as well as a mask – then you should.Internet searches for the soft costume once beloved of early 00s femme celebrity brought me news of a retro revival that apparently started last year. Far further down in the fluffiest of fashion rabbit holes than I had ever intended to travel, I stumbled on to the aesthetic trend of bimbocore.Adherents describe it as “less thoughts, more vibes” and if you’d rather be hot than think, the candy-pink, velveteen look that Britney and Paris made famous two decades ago is an unambiguous signifier of chosen modern levity. Ever the instinctive entrepreneur, Paris is – right now – retailing plush, 93%-polyester luxury on her website, so, yeah, a real thing is happening.The fetishisation of youth might be undergoing a makeover – when has ageing ever looked this fun? | Van BadhamRead moreThe trend-savvy do not have to tell me I have come to bimbocore very late. This is because I am 48 and these days 18 months passes like 10 minutes. At my age, life is hard and TikTok is irritating, so I mostly leave that platform alone. But I have also come to bimbocore with no small amount of jealousy and resentment, because learning the aesthetic exists to satirise the impossibility of meeting contemporary standards of femininity by aggressively performing them makes me desperate to embrace its slutty, pink resistance – and I can’t. Yes, I have the big hair, a requisite collection of shiny hoop earrings and enough shades of lipstick to credibly copy a Rothko painting.Alas, I am more than uncomfortable in microskirts and a midriff top and the mere idea of platform shoes reminds me to call my physio. Wide-eyed pouting by the young registers as ironically Lolitaesque – but on a face like mine, it can only ever read as mockery.Yet my jealousy persists, because how wonderful it is that activist young women and their friends have found a way to channel such a flagrant, public up-yours to the culture of gender policing that grows more exclusive and dangerous by the day. I mean this literally. There is a terrifying Venn overlap growing between capitalist criteria for feminised perfection and radical-right political demands to restrict the franchise of “womanhood” to ever-narrowing groups.This last has anti-transgender protesters and actual Nazis on the streets of Melbourne and anti-trans laws in the US already kicking lesbians out of public bathrooms, given their visible unwillingness to perform gender the way extremists insist they should.Meanwhile, the “tradwife” model homemakers of social media perform a highly merchandised ideal of womanliness without bimbocore’s snideness or irony. If you haven’t worked out tradwives are a soft power comms assault from the far right yet, the memes they post on Musk Twitter really – really – should give it away.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Five Great ReadsFree weekly newsletterEach week our editors select five of the most interesting, entertaining and thoughtful reads published by Guardian Australia and our international colleagues.

If you think ageing female bodies maintain any social value in that calculus, you are wrong. Note the recent laws passed in Kansas restrict the definition of “female” to those still producing “ova”. If you are an infertile, childfree or menopausal woman, a cultural tradition of being made to feel unwomaned by these experiences is now no longer just a nasty social habit. It’s reality under Kansas law.So what’s the appropriate aesthetic for the non-crop-top-compliant to express their resistance and refusal?There have been attempts to define a #cronecore and #hagcore but last time I let my greys grow out and wore a flanno to the shops, the messaging conveyed was hardly subversive.So now I have put in my order for a new tracksuit. My preference is black and hooded, and while I’m not out to culturally appropriate the aesthetic of the Ikkō-ikki I can certainly see the value of culture-jamming, gender-troublemakers learning how to vanish in a crowd. So let me now herald the arrival of the #NinjaCrone aesthetic.In the public theatre of gender activism, imagine an army of assassin-attired older women haunting the dreams of every Nazi, tradwife, anti-trans-bathroom authoritarian and anti-abortionist and making them as afraid of us as the loud sluttiness of our bimbo sisters makes them uncomfortable. We’re invisible to patriarchy anyway, so let’s weaponise the social performance of the ageing woman as anonymous, omnipresent … and capable of anything.The bimbos get it: the far right have already declared their gender war. If you want to fight it, grab a mask and suit up. They will never see us coming.

Photograph: Susan Walsh/AFP/Getty ImagesThe ObserverJoe BidenThe moment has arrived: Biden must give Ukraine all it needs to winSimon TisdallIt’s Zelenskiy who is setting the pace diplomatically and strategically. The US must end the prevaricating that may have needlessly prolonged the warSun 28 May 2023 02.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 28 May 2023 06.37 EDTFoot-dragging, indecision and fearfulness have characterised Joe Biden’s off-screen approach to Ukraine since Russia invaded 15 months ago, compounding doubts about the durability of US support as the 2024 presidential election campaign kicks off. The contrast between Biden and the bold, energetic leadership of Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, is striking. One man frets about disaster and loss. The other thinks only of winning.Biden’s latest, belated and incomplete volte-face, over providing US-made F-16 combat jets, illustrates the problem. Zelenskiy has been asking for fighter planes since the war began. Neighbours such as Poland were sympathetic. Yet afraid of provoking a fight with Russia, Biden, national security adviser Jake Sullivan, and Pentagon officials publicly opposed supplying F-16s until as recently as March.Zelenskiy wanted the planes because he knew Ukraine was vulnerable from the air. As the invasion unfolded, Ukraine’s people, homes and vital infrastructure were mercilessly pounded by Russian missiles. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has explained how F-16s or similar planes might have supported air defence systems, reduced casualties and protected ground troops. But they were not forthcoming.Biden and Sullivan also rejected proposals by experienced former US generals for Nato-patrolled “humanitarian no-fly zones”, initially in western Ukraine, to protect civilians from aerial assault. Although admittedly risky, safe havens akin to past operations in Iraq, Bosnia and Libya might have saved many lives and stemmed the refugee exodus. They still could.Biden’s argument, then as now, is that such interventions, coming on top of large-scale US arms shipments, intelligence-sharing and aid, might be viewed by Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, as escalatory. This seems sensible at first glance. Yet it’s way too cautious. Putin and his lickspittle poltroons, Dmitry Medvedev and Sergei Lavrov, are adept at playing on western fears. Whenever new forms of assistance for Kyiv are mooted, they spew dire threats, sometimes involving nuclear weapons.Biden should listen to Antony Blinken. His secretary of state has spotted a pattern over the past year: Kremlin warnings of retaliation and direct confrontation rarely amount to much in practice. The Russians huff and puff – but mostly bluff. Putin is not entirely stupid. He knows he’d never win a fight with Nato, let alone survive nuclear warfare.Another pattern is apparent: Biden’s chronic indecision. Protracted humming and hawing last year delayed supplies of Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, Patriot batteries, longer-range high-altitude missiles, and M1 Abrams battle tanks – all of which were eventually delivered. European allies such as Germany used White House waffling to excuse their own foot-dragging. These prevarications may have needlessly prolonged the war.The F-16 U-turn, confirmed at last weekend’s G7 summit in Hiroshima, paves the way for training Ukrainian pilots and the provision of “fourth-generation” jets by Nato allies. Yet it’s a typical Biden fudge. The US itself has not committed to supply planes. If it does, it’s unclear whether they will be the latest F-16 models equipped with the latest weapons.A still image from video showing a drone attack on the Kremlin – allegedly the work of Ukraine. Photograph: Ostorozhno Novosti/ReutersUnconvincing explanations are offered for US dithering. Officials say they followed a deliberate plan to ensure Ukraine first received all the heavy weaponry and armoured vehicles required for its long-anticipated counter-offensive. “We could certainly have started earlier, but there were much higher priorities, and it’s seen by some as an escalatory act,” said US air force secretary Frank Kendall, referring to F-16 training.In fact, it was pressure from US allies that proved irresistible when the 50-nation Ukraine Contact Group met at Ramstein air base in Germany last month. US defence secretary Lloyd Austin was urged to think again by old friends such as Britain and the Netherlands, as well as by the eastern Europeans. On his return to Washington, Austin advised Biden to drop his veto.The American shift on fighter planes is a personal triumph for Zelenskiy. His tireless lobbying bore fruit, once again overcoming Biden’s hesitancy and assuaging, if not dispelling, his misgivings. And it shone a light on yet another emerging pattern: how Ukraine’s president, not America’s risk-averse commander-in-chief or the Nato alliance, is driving the west’s wartime agenda.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterArchie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morningPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Ukraine does not belong to the G7, or to the EU or Nato for that matter. But Zelenskiy has earned a place at the top table. His irrepressible diplomacy, aided by Putin’s blundering, has brought membership of both latter organisations within reach.As a leader capable of inspiring his people and influencing international opinion, Zelenskiy puts Biden, Emmanuel Macron, Olaf Scholz and Rishi Sunak to shame. He is also changing the strategic conversation in fundamental ways. US policy towards China, especially Taiwan, has hardened tangibly due to Russia’s aggression – but also thanks to Zelenskiy’s success in re-emphasising the inviolability of territorial borders and national sovereignty as globally recognised imperatives.Ukraine is increasingly setting the pace on the ground, too, independently of its main backers. Incursions into southern Russia by anti-regime militia using US military vehicles, an audacious drone attack on the Kremlin, sabotage, assassinations and mystery explosions in occupied Crimea are a likely prelude to Kyiv’s pivotal counter-offensive. Success is vital if it is to head off Chinese and possible Franco-German pressure this winter to trade land for peace.All this activity, licit and illicit, is compounding White House jitters as American public support for Ukraine appears to soften. Since neither of his main 2024 Republican challengers, Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis, is committed to assisting Kyiv, Biden must be braver and do more, faster – for his time, and Ukraine’s, may be running out. Biden describes the war as a seminal struggle between liberty and tyranny. It is. So give Zelenskiy all he needs to win.TopicsJoe BidenOpinionUS foreign policyVolodymyr ZelenskiyUkrainecommentReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedThe Guardian viewColumnistsLettersOpinion videosCartoonsNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Must be his enormous philanthropy Marina HydeGiving money away is hard, says Lauren Sánchez, who is currently touring Europe with Bezos on his 417ft yachtFri 26 May 2023 10.17 EDTLast modified on Fri 26 May 2023 15.53 EDTOne-click on a fascinator, readers, because there’s a mega-wedding in the offing. Congratulations to Mr Jeff Bezos, Amazon kajillionaire, and Ms Lauren Sánchez, bralette-wearing philanthropist/immense force of nature. Although news of the couple’s engagement seeped out this week after Lauren was spotted wearing a diamond ring in the south of France, Jeff has yet to release a formal announcement. So let’s just draft one for him: “Ladies and gents, she said Proceed to Checkout.”Now look, you already know Jeff. World’s third-richest man. Went to space. Looks like he should be appearing above a daytime TV caption reading “I make £40 a month as a Vin Diesel escort and my fiancee loves it!” But are you fully across Lauren? I’ll be honest: we haven’t met. But from the outside looking in, my nose pressed against the glass of Google Images, I simply cannot get enough of this Nietzschean superwoman, the final form of the East German silicon-doping programme, who has missile-titted her way into my consciousness and now captivates me twice weekly with her insouciance, her outfits, and her observations on just how difficult philanthropy is to do. Seriously: no one has ever thought harder about how to help poors while mooching round a Grand Prix enclosure with some kind of You Could Never Access All My Areas lanyard dangling from her belt loop. In some ways I don’t think I’ve felt this amused by a picaresque heroine since I saw a photo of Jennifer Arcuri biting the head off a fondant-icing Boris Johnson figurine, from a Boris Johnson cake she’d had made. Yes, customers who liked Jennifer also liked Lauren. Not so much a gal-about-town as a gal-about-planet.Anyway, the now-affianced Bezos and Sánchez are currently touring Europe on Jeff’s new yacht, Koru, a 417ft three-master/three-peniser that is the largest such vessel ever built. To put things into perspective, this yacht is so big it has its own yacht – a 246ft “support vessel”, which lugs around boring little things like the helicopter pad and reportedly some kind of personal submarine. And this week, for the first time, we saw Koru’s figurehead. Ships’ figureheads have traditionally come in various forms, of course: mermaids, Neptunes, angels – and now, Fox-News-anchor-in-transparent-singlet-with-erect-nipples. Suck on it, history! Our century is so the best. The Bezos yacht figurehead is fingering a large pendant necklace, and appears to be about to say something. “Draw me like one of your French girls”? Either way, the vast boat it adorns only recently left the shipyard, hopefully while some urchin child on the dock cackled: “Yeah but you’ll never be cool, will you, Bezos – YOU’LL NEVER BE COOL!”But will the Amazon boss ever, really, even be a genuine philanthropist? We do seem to be at the stage of human intellectual decay where anyone who is a multibillionaire is also automatically described as a “philanthropist”, when in many cases “misanthropist” would be more supported by the evidence. For instance, I’m forever seeing Dubai ruler Sheikh Mohammed described as a philanthropist. Is he the one who has at least two of his children missing/kidnapped at any given moment? Honestly, so what if he’s built a sanitation programme? I should hope so.Back to Lauren, though, who last year declared: “I’m immersing myself in philanthropy and strategic giving.” Which sounds a lot more fun than Amazon warehouse workers immersing themselves in strategic peeing-in-bottles. Yet it turns out this stuff is hard. “You want to give money away,” claimed Lauren. “You want to know that it’s helping people and it’s going to continue to help people, and that it’s going to the right places. You could give it not-strategically. You can just give it away! But, we take it seriously.” Mm. It feels like they’ve thought of everything except Amazon paying tax like normal businesses.The question of quite how much Bezos does truly want to give away is a thorny one, given he once said: “The only way that I can see to deploy this much financial resource is by converting my Amazon winnings into space travel.” Or as Lauren puts it: “Jeff has always told me, since I’ve known him, that he’s going to give the majority of his money away to philanthropy.” I hope you love the phoned-in generality of that “to philanthropy”.Even so, maybe “I’m going to give the majority of my money away to philanthropy” is the kind of thing you say to get laid in the early stages of a relationship. I’m suddenly reminded of Anne Hathaway’s former boyfriend, who told the movie star he was “the chief financial officer of the Vatican”. “My boyfriend is incredible,” Anne duly told the world. “But when it comes to his charity ... one of the most untouted aphrodisiacs in the world is charity work. Seriously, you want a girl to be impressed, vaccinate some kids, build a house.” Anne’s boyfriend would go on to serve a four-and-a-half-year jail term for fraud, with probably my favourite detail in the FBI files being that he had fake monsignor robes hanging in his and Anne’s wardrobe at their $37,500-a-month Trump Tower penthouse.But look, it’s all a journey. And we’re so, so lucky that Jeff’s still in the pretending-to-give-a-toss stage of things with Lauren, taking a veeeeery long run-up to a minuscule percentage of “strategic giving” on his half-a-billion-dollar boat. These fauxlanthropists may not give the world their taxes – but they do at least give us a few laughs. Strategically, or otherwise.

This time, though, I hope not too widely. I’d be happy if it doesn’t catch the attention of Jacob Rees-Mogg or of government officials.I’m due to give a talk to civil servants later this year. If anyone were to trawl through my social media they might discover the occasional criticism of government policy. And I might suffer the same fate as Dan Kaszeta.An expert on chemical weapons, Kaszeta had been invited to address a government-organised conference on the issue last week. Then, he was disinvited because, as an official email put it, a “check on your social media has identified materials that criticised government officials and policy”.Under secret rules drawn up by Rees-Mogg, civil servants must trawl through social media posts of all speakers at official events. Anyone critical of government policy can be banned. Not just Kaszeta, but a number of other speakers, too, have been disinvited for “criticism of government policy”.This is a government that preens its advocacy of free speech. Its Higher Education (Freedom of Speech) Act 2023, which became law this month, allows speakers to seek compensation if they are “no-platformed” and empowers the Office for Students (OfS) to fine infringing institutions. But what the law proclaims universities mustn’t do, the government itself is happy to.The greatest chill on free speech in universities today comes not from students no-platforming speakers but from Prevent, the government anti-terror policy that has helped create a climate of self-censorship, placing certain topics, ideas and arguments off-limits. In 2019, the court of appeal ruled that Prevent guidance to universities was unlawful because it was so “unbalanced” against free speech.Earlier this year, in a parliamentary debate, the home secretary, Suella Braverman, called for opponents of Prevent to be denied a “platform” to “ensure that… misrepresentations of Prevent are deterred”. A government whose own legislation demands that universities be sanctioned if they ban speakers with controversial views wants also to no-platform critics of its own policies.It’s not just the government with a one-eyed view of free expression. Recent years have seen the emergence of organisations, such as Toby Young’s brainchild, the Free Speech Union (FSU), whose defence of free speech seems driven primarily by a hostility to “woke” policies. Last week, the FSU tweeted about Matthew Goodwin’s new book on the “woke elite” (it is hosting a panel discussion on it), and about Amazon’s “sanitising” of David Cronenberg’s 1988 cult classic film Dead Ringers in its remake. It was, however, silent on the Kaszeta ban.The FSU’s 2020 report Threats to Academic Freedom in Britain mentions the impact of Prevent policies just once, and then only to castigate “leftists” for being more concerned about “threats from outside the university” than about the woke culture of censorship internally. And where the FSU has welcomed the new universities free speech law and dismissed criticisms, longstanding anti-censorship organisations, such as Index on Censorship and English PEN, have rightly warned of the dangers of state-imposed free expression.Yet, if there is a selectiveness in the way anti-woke free speech champions look upon censorship, many of the issues they highlight are nevertheless important. There is growing support in sections of the left and on campuses for the suppression of unacceptable views.The Higher Education Policy Institute found in a student survey last year that 79% thought “Students that feel threatened should always have their demands for safety respected” and more than a third believed academics should be sacked for teaching “material that heavily offends some students”. “Many people may be surprised, perhaps even unsettled”, the report observed, “by the greater keenness of students to limit what their peers and lecturers can say and do within the law”.Last week, the OfS, as part of its regular reporting on the impact of Prevent guidance, published data on cancellations of university talks. Out of 31,545 speakers in the academic year 2021-22, 260 had their events cancelled. The reasons for doing so are unclear; the OfS data unfortunately does not show how many speakers were banned because their views were deemed unacceptable. Whatever the figure, it is small – less than 1%. This shouldn’t lead us to conclude, though, that there is no issue. Controversial speakers will inevitably be small in number, but attempts to stop them speaking often highlight a deeper problem, particularly the tendency to portray political and social disagreements as “hatred” or “bigotry”.The most incendiary issue at the moment is that of trans rights. “Gender critical” feminists such as Kathleen Stock or Julie Bindel, who argue for the importance of sex-based rights and for the exclusion of transgender women from sex-based, women-only spaces, such as refuges or prisons, have faced calls for their meetings to be shut down.There is an important debate about how to negotiate trans and women’s rights. Shutting down one side is unacceptableMany of their critics argue that such individuals are not being censored because they have other platforms on which they are able to express their views, from newspaper columns to books. That is to miss the point. After all, Kaszeta can also avail himself of other platforms. That does not mean that what happened to him is not censorship.At the same time, opponents of gender critical views should be equally free to express themselves. Last week, a tweet from Oxford University LGBTQ+ campaign calling for Stock’s invitation to speak at the Oxford Union to be rescinded was taken down by the student union on the grounds it might infringe the new law. The FSU crowed about it as a victory. It was, in fact, a blatant denial of free speech. The episode revealed both how state-imposed free speech can itself be a form of censorship and how little the FSU understands about the meaning of free expression.There is an important debate about how to negotiate trans rights and women’s rights, and how best to ensure that both are respected. Shutting down one side of the debate as unacceptable will not settle the issues but merely make it more difficult to work out a fair solution.For too many people today, on both the left and the anti-woke right, what matters about free speech depends upon which side of the culture wars they stand. It is an issue too important to be treated with such casual disdain. Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist

Photograph: Andrew SuttonOrcas in the strait of Gibraltar, with the Moroccan coast behind. Photograph: Andrew SuttonOpinionWhalesOrcas are ramming yachts off the Spanish coast – is the whale world rising up?Philip HoareOne explanation is that their behaviour is a reaction to past trauma inflicted on one member of the pod by humansThu 25 May 2023 09.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 25 May 2023 13.25 EDTRecent accounts of “attacks” on vessels by orcas off the Iberian peninsula are challenging the way we expect the natural world to behave. Increasing in number since 2020, from northern Portugal to the strait of Gibraltar, these incidents suggest the need for a cetacean scene investigation team. On 4 May, in one of the most extreme events, orcas sank a yacht.“There were two smaller orcas and one larger,” the skipper Werner Schaufelberger told German magazine Yacht. “The little ones shook the rudder at the back while the big one repeatedly backed up and rammed the boat with full force from the side.”The word “attack” used in conjunction with animals is a human judgment; their actions are more likely to be defensive. But there is definitely something strange going on. Andrew Sutton, an experienced underwater photographer with whom I work and who is familiar with these particular orca pods, has noted them “doing weird things” in the strait, including “whacking rudders off and annoying fishermen”.Having witnessed two big intervention episodes last year, he suspects that an increase in vessels may be a factor – not least because the strait is now the most popular route for migrants setting off from Morocco.The Grupo Trabajo Orca Atlántica (GTOA, or Atlantic Orca Working Group), a highly respected partnership of Spanish and Portuguese scientists, has recorded hundreds of such reports, with 29 incidents this year around the strait alone. They believe that just 15 individuals, of a population of more than 50, are responsible.‘Orcas, not us, are probably the most successful mammal on Earth.’ Photograph: Andrew SuttonDr Alfredo López Fernandez, of GTOA, told me that they have two hypotheses. One, the orcas “have invented something new and repeat it. This behaviour matches the profile of juveniles.” Or that it is a “response to an adverse situation; one or several individuals have had a bad experience and are trying to stop the boat so as not to repeat it. This behaviour coincides with the profile of adults.”Either way, it is an astonishing notion. Dr López Fernandez and his team have named, generically, the interacting orcas Gladis (after their original scientific name, Orca gladiator). They suspect an individual, Gladis Blanca, initiated this behaviour after a “critical moment of agony”, perhaps as a result of collison with a vessel; she also has a young daughter, born in 2021. Other Gladis whales have been entangled with fishing gear or suffered lacerations and even amputations. “All this has to make us reflect on the fact that human activities are at the origin of this behaviour.”The bare bones of Dr López Fernandez’s report evoke a plaintive story. Orca society is matriarchal; it recognises post-menopausal females as the most important members of a pod. Females pass on knowledge of feeding grounds and techniques. In the interventions, “grandmother” orcas have been seen to be observers, as if directing the events.Luke Rendell of the University of St Andrews has studied orcas extensively in the wild. He said that, while we can only speculate about the causes: “The spread of reaction to past trauma by one individual is plausible … but so are other explanations such as curiosity and play.”Part of me is secretly excited at this idea of nature fighting back. According to the charity Whale and Dolphin Conservation, at least 174 orcas have died in captivity since 1961, having been forced to swim aimlessly about in overgrown swimming pools without any of the peer interaction that defines them.The first whale I ever saw was an orca named (by humans) Ramu. He was kept in the dolphinarium at Windsor Safari Park (now Legoland) in the 1970s. As I and my whale-besotted sisters watched Ramu jump through his hoop, we realised that a magnificent animal had been reduced to a circus trick.I’ve spent 20 years seeing and writing about whales, but I didn’t see an orca again until 2017. Andrew Sutton and I were eight nautical miles off the coast of Sri Lanka, diving with a megapod of sperm whales. Close by, we came upon 30 of them surrounded by two pods of orcas trying to predate the sperm whale calves. When one of the orcas headed directly at us, we quickly got back in the boat.The orcas were defeated by the massed sperm whales. One pod left the scene. The other reassembled nearby. And we followed, out of curiosity. They began to circle us in the same way they had done with the whales, then head-butted our boat three times.‘Extraordinary’ sighting of orca with baby pilot whale astounds scientistsRead moreI was the only one looking over the other side when five of the whales charged at us. It was utterly terrifying. At the last moment they slipped beneath us. As one of the Blue Planet film unit later told me, it is the same technique used by orcas to flip seals off ice floes.I felt I’d given up all notion of being a “superior” animal. Instead, I was part of this interaction of three cultures: orca, sperm whale and human. Orcas, not us, are probably the most successful mammal on Earth. They’ve been around in their evolved state for 6m years, and are present in every ocean. They have no known predator. Except us.I’ve no idea if the Iberian orcas are expressing a struggle for survival as we deplete their food sources and pollute their environment. Or just playing with us. But when Ranil Nanayakkara, the scientist with us on the boat, pulled up his underwater microphone after the orcas had gone, he discovered it had been bitten off.With thanks to Jeroen Hoekendijk

She has the right to be silent on Healy – but her fans also have the right to judge her for itSat 27 May 2023 09.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 27 May 2023 09.57 EDTTaylor Swift, Matty Healy and a lot of bad bloodWeird coincidence alert! Taylor Swift recently released a collaboration with rapper Ice Spice on a remix of her Midnights track Karma. That’s a big deal for two reasons: 1) Ice Spice is going to be the first Black woman to feature on a Swift song; 2) Matty Healy, the frontman of the band the 1975 and the man that Swift is rumoured to be dating, laughed at some racist jokes about the Bronx rapper on a recent podcast. It’s leading a lot of people to ask: is the Swift/Ice Spice collaboration a calculated attempt at damage control? Is this a cynical PR move? Or is the convenient timing just a fluke?It’s impossible to say for sure. What is clear is that Swift’s army of passionate fans are less than thrilled about the megastar’s rumoured romance with Healy, who has cultivated an “edgelord” persona and always seems to be battling one controversy or another. The Ice Spice episode is in the headlines now because of the connection to Swift, but it actually happened back in January when Healy appeared on a podcast called The Adam Friedland Show and mentioned that he tried to message the rapper on Instagram. The two hosts of the show, Friedland and Nick Mullen – who are famous for starting a podcast called Cum Town which is full of “ironic” bigotry – then had a good little giggle while they called the rapper an “Inuit spice girl”, “a fucking Eskimo or something” and a “chubby Chinese lady” (Ice Spice is Nigerian and Dominican). They also did racist impersonations of various different accents while Healy laughs along. Healy later said he was “kind of a bit sorry” if he upset Ice Spice during the podcast. Which is really very big of the guy.Healy didn’t just laugh along at some offensive jokes once: he has a long history of making problematic statements. It’s possible that some of those statements – such as the time he told the Guardian that he’d never date Swift because it would be “emasculating” – were taken out of context and unfairly interpreted, but many of his “jokes” are extremely hard to excuse. On the same podcast where he mocked Ice Spice, for example, Friedland casually joked about how a friend of Healy’s once walked in on the musician watching porn on Ghetto Gaggers, a porn site that features women of colour being degraded and humiliated. “[It] literally was Ghetto Gaggers on the TV – somebody just getting, like, brutalized,” Healy laughs. Hilarious! They also joked about women’s periods and the moon controlling menstrual cycles. The episode was eventually pulled from Spotify and Apple following backlash.That backlash is now growing and fans are asking Swift to directly address the controversy under the hashtag #SpeakUpNow. “[Healy] has been involved in acts and controversies that deeply trouble us,” one viral open letter tweeted by a fan reads. “While individuals have the right to make their own choices and form relationships, we believe that it is essential for those in the public eye to take a stand against discrimination and hold themselves and their associates accountable.”One the hand, it’s a bit worrying how invested some of Swift’s fans are in her personal life: Healy and Swift, let’s remember, are not officially an item – they’ve just been spotted together a few times. On the other hand, the fans who are demanding that she address Healy’s offensive comments have a point. Swift has never pretended to be an activist and rarely makes any sort of political statement. Nor is she responsible for the past actions of whoever she happens to be seen canoodling in public with. Still, there’s no getting around the fact that Swift is incredibly influential and who she aligns herself with matters. Swift has the right to remain silent on Healy’s past but her fans also have the right to judge her for it.Indiana doctor fined for discussing 10-year-old’s abortionRemember that horrifying story last year about a 10-year-old Ohio girl who was raped and had to leave her state to get a legal abortion? Remember how rightwingers and Republican politicians’ immediate reaction to the story was to yell about it being fake news? When the story was proven to be true, they changed tack and started threatening Dr Caitlin Bernard, the source for the original Indianapolis Star story, with disciplinary action for violating patient privacy laws. This week the Indiana state medical board ruled that Bernard will not lose her license but will have to pay $3,000 in fines and receive a letter of reprimand. It seems clear that Indiana is trying to make an example of Bernard and to stop other healthcare professionals from speaking up about what Bernard described as the “real-world impacts of the laws of this country”.Ex-guard charged with 95 counts of sexual abuse in California women’s prisonAllegations against Gregory Rodriguez date back more than 10 years. “If one officer is getting away with this for more than a decade, he is backed up by other officers and by the system,” Colby Lenz, an advocate with the California Coalition for Women Prisoners, told the Guardian. “This is not just one bad apple.Is Martha Stewart, 81, being on the cover of Sports Illustrated a feminist triumph?Not exactly, says Nancy Jo Sales. “Our sense of whether women continue to be sexually attractive as they age is so heavily influenced by the entertainment, beauty and fashion industries … that I don’t know if we’re always in full possession of our own feelings about it.”Taliban restrictions on women a ‘crime against humanity’In a joint report, Amnesty International and the International Commission of Jurists have said the Taliban’s treatment of women and girls amount to gender persecution, which is defined as a crime against humanity by the international criminal court.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to The Week in PatriarchyFree weekly newsletterReviewing the most important stories on feminism and sexism and those fighting for equalityPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Photograph: Pete Still/RedfernsThe ObserverTina TurnerRaw talent and a refusal to accept barriers made Tina Turner greatMaureen MahonShe later became an icon of survival, but fans loved her for the sheer energy she exudedSun 28 May 2023 04.01 EDTLast modified on Sun 28 May 2023 05.12 EDTTina Turner, the trailblazing singer who was hailed as the queen of rock’n’roll, survived so many personal and professional challenges that some of her fans might have believed that she was going to live forever.Her death last week at the age of 83 brought home the fact that she was as mortal as the rest of us, but her refusal to stay in the box that Black women are expected to occupy will remain a lasting source of inspiration.Turner’s musical journey is front of mind to me as a scholar who researches the contributions African American women have made to rock’n’roll. She was a bona fide superstar, the only artist I have written about who has such a high level of name recognition among people who are not pop fans. Indeed, as has become clear in the days since her death, everyone seems to have heard of her. I am fascinated by her ability to have achieved this level of celebrity and the skilful way she mobilised her remarkable vocal talent and riveting stage presence to refuse and resist being consigned to the margins of popular music.Born Anna Mae Bullock in 1939, the young Tina Turner did not have an easy childhood, but she had the capacity to imagine other possibilities and a willingness to work to achieve her dreams. Anna Mae loved singing. She sang in church and sang along with the rhythm and blues (R&B), pop, blues and country music that she heard on the radio when she was growing up in rural Tennessee.When, as a teenager, she saw the Kings of Rhythm she had the audacity to ask the bandleader, Ike Turner, to let her sing with them. Little Ann, as she was known back then, captured audiences in the late 1950s with the urgency of a voice that deployed rough vocal textures, shouts, screams and pure singing power.As the frontwoman for the Ike and Tina Turner Revue during the 1960s and 70s, she became known for a unique combination of energetic vocals and non-stop movement. She and her backing singers, the Ikettes, sang full throttle and performed rapid-fire dance steps; the whirling arms, swinging hair and fringed mini dresses added excitement to the show.Turner wasn’t afraid to be sexy and she wasn’t afraid to sweat. She was a bracing alternative to the controlled and composed style of performance that dominated among Black women during this period.She was a bracing alternative to the controlled and composed style of performance that dominated among Black womenBut she was also seeking a way out of her abusive marriage and professional partnership with Ike Turner. She had attempted suicide – and knew that she had to make a change. Well outside the box of the Christianity she had been raised in, she found in Nichiren Buddhism and the practice of regular chanting a source of strength that enabled her to escape the debilitating existence that was her marriage.Her disclosures about the abuse she suffered during her 16 years with Ike shocked fans, but by leaving him she provided a model for people who were contending with intimate partner abuse. She became an icon of survival, not simply because she left her tormenter but because of the tremendous professional success that she achieved after the split.That success was not preordained. When she started out on her solo career path in the late 1970s, she was working in a recording industry that generally kept African American artists from participating in the lucrative genres of pop and rock. But Turner was tired of singing R&B and determined to move on.In direct opposition to conventional recording industry wisdom, she set her sights on rock, dreaming of large-scale concerts at arenas. It was an uphill battle to convince decision-makers to offer a contract to a Black woman in her 40s who wanted to play a style of music seen as the purview of white youth. Never mind the fact that rock was rooted in African American music. Never mind the fact that she had honed her skills alongside Ike Turner, one of the originators of rock’n’roll.It took about four years to secure the recording contract that led to her 1984 blockbuster Private Dancer. Recorded in London in collaboration with white rockers who were longtime fans, the album delved into the sound of 1980s hard rock and synth pop. By placing Turner’s unmistakable voice in the foreground of songs it sealed her reputation as a versatile rock singer, possibly the best one working at the time.The attitude-rich track What’s Love Got to Do With It gave Turner her first No 1 single and before long she was headlining sold-out concerts at the stadiums that she had dreamed of playing. Grammy awards, more chart-topping recordings, and record-breaking tours followed. She reimagined what a Black woman vocalist could do.Turner escaped domestic violence and circumvented recording industry racism, sexism and ageism. She reinvented herself in her 40s, became a global pop superstar and, after a glorious run, retired from the stage as the undisputed queen of rock’n’roll. She leaves behind recordings and concert footage that showcase the inimitable voice and indomitable spirit that propelled her career and paved the way for artists, especially Black women like Beyoncé and Brittany Howard, who dare to think and do otherwise. Tina Turner’s legacy is her singular reminder of what is possible if you step outside the box.

Not any moreMartha GillFlaws used to feed their sales but now writers are expected to be saintsSat 27 May 2023 13.31 EDT‘As you get older you realise that all these things – prizes, reviews, advances, readers – it’s all showbiz, and the real action starts with your obituary.”Martin Amis first started spinning in favour of his future obituarists in 2003 – at the juncture, post Yellow Dog, at which prizes, reviews, advances and readers began to turn against him. He knew how things would play out. After two decades of the literary world quiet quitting Martin Amis, there has been a sudden rehabilitation. In the past week the pages of obituary sections have exploded with a strangely pre-2003 phenomenon – a semi-tolerant fascination with Amis’s personal life, and the way it may have bled into his work, and vice versa.Martin Amis was Mick Jagger in literary form, I was besotted | Geoff DyerRead moreThere is a nostalgia to these pieces: they strike the reader as missives from another age. What used to be a staple of literary culture – a sort of relaxed curiosity towards the proclivities of writers, their outrageous love affairs, their bad political opinions – is now really only to be found in obituaries sections. Before 2003, or thereabouts, was a long era in which flawed personalities were routinely sold as part of the package: writers and artists and rock stars shored up their place in the firmament by revealing or cultivating a complicated life. Martin Amis, Christopher Hitchens, Philip Larkin: the lothario, the drunken raconteur, the recluse. The image fed the fame, which fed the sales. Gossip-informed readers enjoyed speculating about the points at which fact met fiction – who had inspired what? Were you really a writer if you didn’t live like one? But things have changed.We still obsess over difficult artists in prestige films – from a minimum distance of 50 years or so. But for our current crop of writers, painters, musicians and the rest, personality is out of fashion. In fact, those we hold up as cultural icons must now live the blameless apolitical lives of minor royals. Any hint of deviation from the head boy or girl act can inflict terrible harm – once you have been shunned by a small group on Twitter, you should start worrying your publishers will be next.Few writers with messy lives or offbeat opinions now top bestseller lists. There are no Ernest Hemingways or Ted Hugheses. The “imperfect” and the “complex” are celebrated more loudly than ever, but only in promotional press releases for the novels. Under the many watchful eyes on social media, the swaggeringly counter-cultural life is entirely off limits – in fact most so-called scandals now involve a slip-up, or a crack in a careful persona. Sally Rooney, who lives quietly, once said something political, which was a mistake, and has complained about fame, which didn’t go down well either. Lena Dunham, celebrated for her flawed characters, was deserted by fans for revealing various (rather similar) flaws herself. They had never liked her work after all, former devotees started saying – in fact she was a bad writer. And her characters were unlikeable too.Sally Rooney, who lives quietly, once said something political, which was a mistake. Photograph: Gary Doak/AlamyThere is Taylor Swift, who is currently suffering a sort of sexually transmitted blow-back: her crime is to date a controversial singer. And there is the celebrity philosopher Agnes Callard, who was recently revealed not only to have left her husband for a student, but to now be living with both of them. In the course of a long profile in the New Yorker, she theorised about the philosophical implications of the love triangle – as a three, “they would all keep talking about philosophy, but with fresh ideas in the mix”. What will one day delight obituarists disgusted New Yorker readers: she was universally condemned.Are we witnessing sexism: the expectation that women, however talented, must always be on their best behaviour? It is probably worth asking if the gender of today’s cultural stars has something to do with it. They are no longer overwhelmingly male, particularly in the literary world (on Granta’s list of best young British novelists last month just one in five were men).Are we witnessing sexism: the expectation that women, however talented, must always be on their best behaviour? This is probably part of it, although men are treated the same way these days: Will Self, who is alleged to have treated his ex-wife appallingly, has suffered a tarnishing of his literary brand. And there are counter examples. You think of Iris Murdoch’s adulterous bed hopping, or Doris Lessing abandoning her two children, or Joni Mitchell putting her child up for adoption, and wonder if this would be tolerated among new authors and celebrities in 2023. (Lena Dunham, after all, was cancelled for adopting a rescue dog then changing her mind.)There seems to be something broader going on. Where once the talented artist was forgiven almost anything, we are now in a period of overcorrection. “A man must be a very great genius to make up for being such a loathsome human being,” Martha Gellhorn once said. We no longer accept the trade-off. In fact, in a surfeit of egalitarianism, we now seem to require geniuses to behave better than the rest of us.It is good news, of course, that talented monsters aren’t given the free pass they once were. The period of history in which someone could dodge prison if they were a dab hand with a paintbrush is thankfully over. But I worry we have swung into an era in which likeability comes first and talent later. It is not a coincidence that original thinkers have often dodged conformity – moral or otherwise.

Maybe you don’t find it so. Maybe current affairs interest you in direct proportion to their importance. If so, you’re lucky. For most of us, the dry detail and/or savage tragedy of momentous issues drive our minds towards triviality. I have never grasped what’s happening in Syria or why to be scared about China, so this week I’ve been digging into what’s going on with Holly and Phil.This is not what the two people involved want. That’s one thing they would still agree on. These are not circumstances where those at the centre of a furore are feeding off it and enjoying it, like Piers Morgan or Ryanair. Having resigned as co-presenter of This Morning (and subsequently from ITV), Schofield will want the story to go away. The things he has come to prominence saying on television are too bland to be noticed if the viewers are all speculating on whether he’s a nightmare to work with. Similarly, as she continues on the show, Willoughby’s ability to seem sympathetic and relatable for two and a half hours every morning will be compromised by a lingering aura of anger and ruthlessness.They want this to stop. ITV wants this to stop. Hence the disingenuous expressions of goodwill amid the wreckage. Schofield stepping down saying “I want to do what I can to protect the show that I love”; Willoughby thanking him “for all of his knowledge, his experience and his humour”, adding “the sofa won’t feel the same without him”; and, on the programme itself, from which Willoughby is also currently absent, Alison Hammond and Dermot O’Leary paying tribute in such shaken and sombre tones that, had they not tremulously wished him “all the best for the future”, you’d think he’d died.This is what makes the story so diverting. The contrast between the evident reality and the hastily applied coat of bullshit. They are lying to us and we can tell. That makes us feel powerful and them look foolish. And it’s a much better story than the one they’ve been feeding us for years.Let’s look at that story. It was that Phil and Holly were inseparable and devoted buddies. The last we heard of it was earlier in the month when, in the hope of quelling the storm of gossip, Schofield released a statement saying: “Holly is my rock. We’re the best of friends… Holly has always been there for me, through thick and thin. And I’ve been there for her.”“Sources” were quick to say that Willoughby had been enraged by this outburst but, for years, it had been the party line. They were supposedly exceptionally close friends: they went on holiday together and, in 2016, released photos of themselves splashing in the sea with Phil in an “I heart HW” T-shirt and Holly in an “I heart PS” one. This was partly a parody of the affair Tom Hiddleston and Taylor Swift were conducting at the time in which Hiddleston had proclaimed his regard by means of papped-T-shirt, but it was also supposed to be sincere. Schofield captioned one of the photos with the word “bestie” which Willoughby then reposted, adding “Love!!!”.You can’t ‘have it all out’ because the root cause of each person’s distress is the other’s constant presenceThis is all a bit emetic, but they’d obviously concluded that, whether they were close or not in real life, it was a good idea to seem like they were. Perhaps they were inspired by Ant and Dec, whose friendship has made them market leaders of their genre of television. But Ant and Dec met as teenagers, came to prominence side by side and stayed there. They are indisputably genuine friends. Were Phil and Holly?It is entirely plausible that, before recent controversies over queue-jumping in Westminster Hall and the prosecution of Schofield’s brother, they got on fine. Or well. Or even extremely well. But projecting the notion that they were splashing-in-the-waves “besties” is over-egging the pudding. There’s a 19-year age gap. He’s been on telly since she was four. That doesn’t preclude their being friends but it would inform the relationship. There was no suggestion of that texture in the story they were trying to tell, which was basically just a couple of kids having a hell of a laugh. Except one of them’s in his 60s.Their friendship was a fiction written by people unskilled at writing fiction. Consciously or subliminally, the audience didn’t buy it and felt patronised. So when the lie is exposed, that’s box office.Working intensively with one other person in showbusiness can be trying. I know this from years of constant creative collaboration with Robert Webb, an extremely close friend of mine whom, for months at a time, I found unbearable. My only consolation was that he felt the same about me. This was during a period when we were working together – either writing or performing – for the vast majority of the time we were awake. When you spend hours and hours, day after day, with the same person, and it is someone with whom you are not in love, it’s hard not to take their continued presence as a long, low-energy assault on your very soul.Whatever the specifics of Schofield and Willoughby’s quarrel, a major cause can be summarised in two words: you again. They must be sick of each other, a condition that their attempts to broadcast an image of idyllic amity on social media will have exacerbated because it necessitated spending even more time together.Rob and I could have given them a key piece of advice. It’s simple: don’t have a row. We never have. Even though you want to, don’t. It will not clear the air, it will poison it. You can’t “have it all out” because the root cause of each person’s distress is the other’s constant presence. That is not OK to express. There is no person who can take that well, let alone one who is already finding you infuriating. You cannot say: “The incessant pressure of your personality has left a bruise on my brain.” You must say nothing, remain civil, revel in passive aggression and, at the first opportunity, go on holiday with someone else. That way, when you come home, you’ll still have a job.
